      "Wayne Rooney has admitted his frustration with Ruben Amorim's apparent disregard for the Manchester United academy. Much was debated about the contrast between Amorim and United's tradition of nurturing young talent throughout his 14-month spell as head coach, with detractors arguing he failed to grasp the club's heritage.",
      "Since the Portuguese coach was dismissed and club legend Michael Carrick took over as interim boss until the summer, many have been thrilled by his enthusiasm for the club's youth set-up, mirroring Sir Alex Ferguson's approach.",
      "Amorim seldom looked to homegrown stars, with Kobbie Mainoo among the players he sidelined. In contrast, Carrick already seems willing to depend on youngsters with 'club DNA', having watched the under-21s team last week.",
      "Carrick's own son plays for the under-16s and other young players' families feel their offspring will now have better opportunities, given the former midfielder's greater insight. This includes Carrick's ex-team-mate Rooney, whose sons Kai and Klay are also in United's youth ranks.",

      "Rooney said on his BBC podcast: \"It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy. In the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest.",
      "\"On Saturday, they were all at the under-16s game as well before they travelled to London. It is great to see that coming back into the club.",
      "\"I have been quite vocal on this. It used to be the norm but it has been missing in the last few years. With my two lads in the academy, I haven't seen that and it was a bit disappointing.",

      "Manchester United’s new manager could oversee his first game in Helsinki as the club continues to put plans for next season together. The Red Devils remain on the hunt for a new permanent boss despite Michael Carrick’s excellent impact.",
      "The former midfielder replaced Ruben Amorim until the end of the season earlier this month and has impressed, having beaten Manchester City and Arsenal. However, the plan remains for Carrick to step aside ahead of the 2026/27 campaign.",
      "And despite having not yet found the man to take the reins, plans are already being put in place for next season. According to The Sun, United chiefs are set to organise pre-season games in both Helsinki and Gothenburg.",
      "Talks remain ongoing but plans are seemingly close to being finalised. United usually visit the USA for a lucrative pre-season tour, but with the World Cup being held in the country, as well as Mexico and Canada, it appears that the plan has been changed.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Should everything be organised as expected, the games may represent the first chance for the new United boss to run the rule over their side. Scandinavia is not an unfamiliar place to the Red Devils, having kicked off their pre-season calendar there against Leeds United last season, while they took on Turkish giants Galatasaray in Gothenburg in 2016.",
      "And while the pre-season calendar is taking shape, United will certainly be keen on finishing off the current campaign positively. The Red Devils currently sit fourth in the table ahead of this weekend’s clash with Fulham.",
      "Carrick has been told that a spot in the Champions League is a target for the club between now and May. Asked how he has found his spell in charge so far, he replied: \"I'm enjoying it. It's a fantastic position to be in. What happens next: I'm not going to be answering it every week. I'm enjoying it and I'll continue to do what I can.\"",

      "Despite Carrick’s impressive stint so far, a number of high-profile managers have been linked with the job. England boss Thomas Tuchel is on the club’s shortlist alongside Mauricio Pochettino and Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta has described Dro Fernandez's departure as 'unpleasant', after Hansi Flick highlighted Marcus Rashford's commitment as the perfect blueprint for what the club's youngsters should strive towards.",
      "Fernandez has sealed a switch to Paris Saint-Germain following his surprising decision to submit a transfer request. The 18-year-old reportedly activated his own £5.1million release clause in an attempt to push through a departure this month.",
      "The teenager joined Barcelona at 14, and made his Champions League debut in October, where he provided an assist as Barca thrashed Olympiacos 6-1. Now, Fernandez has penned a deal that will keep him in the French capital until 2030.",
      "Flick was left exasperated by the circumstances, and when questioned about it before the transfer, had to hold back his thoughts. \"Sometimes it's like that, that, yes, you do not agree with what they are doing, but they are 18, they are old enough to make decisions, they have people around them,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, when I see like...no, no, I don't want to talk anymore, it's enough.\"",

      "\"We have to wait. We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].",
      "\"This is what I want to say to young players from La Masia: We are Barca and we are one of the best teams in the world. We give them the opportunity to train with us, to grow, to train with the best players in the world, the support and the confidence.",

      "Carrick, who was previously a member of Solskjaer's coaching team, returned to Old Trafford earlier this month on a contract until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was sacked by the Red Devils. The former Middlesbrough manager, who left the Championship side by mutual consent back in the summer, has made an instant impact in the role, beating Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games.",

      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the former United midfielder said of Carrick: \"He’s come into the job now and it’s been that bad for a year that it couldn’t really get any worse so the pressure isn’t really on you while you’re interim manager. Once you take that job full-time, at the start of the season next year, let’s say, all of a sudden you’ve got to be winning games straightaway.",

      "Nicky Butt was in agreement and believes Carrick will know the score in that his chances of becoming Manchester United's long-term head coach are slim. \"I think Michael is that bright and intelligent, he’ll understand the job that he’s got,\" Butt added.",

      "The Red Devils captain was the subject of serious transfer interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia back in the summer. The Portugal international even made it clear he was \"hurt\" by the club hierarchy over what he perceived to be as them trying to sell him.",
      "Interest in him is all but guaranteed again with his contract running until 2027, albeit with an option to extend those terms for a further year. And with Fernandes now 31, he knows he is now in line for his last major payday when it comes to contracts.",
      "Whispers of a lucrative transfer to the Middle East refuse to die down despite Fernandes deciding to stay at Old Trafford in the summer. Nobody seems to be willing to shut down talk of a move for good, though.",
      "The prospect of cashing in on Fernandes comes with the huge caveat that he remains, by some distance, the team's best player. And he's showing no signs of slowing down, either. Make no mistake, replacing a player of his immense quality would be a seismic challenge for whoever United choose to be their next permanent head coach or Carrick, if he continues to impress and retains the job beyond the end of the season.",
      "Cole Palmer is said to be unsettled and has been linked with Manchester United(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",

      "A deal for Palmer would likely not come cheap given he is contracted until 2033. But there is the prospect that the club could fund such a move by sanctioning a large sale, such as Fernandes.",

The final match of the weekend saw the Red Devils snatch a late winner against Premier League leaders Arsenal, reigniting the title race whilst propelling United into the Champions League spots for the first time this campaign.",
      "The away side fought back to establish a 2-1 advantage early in the second half following a Lisandro Martinez own goal which had opened the scoring, before Bryan Mbeumo levelled matters before the interval and Patrick Dorgu's strike, following some superb build-up play, put United ahead in the 50th minute.",
      "Arsenal's Mikel Merino believed he had salvaged a point for his team late in the contest until Matheus Cunha emerged from the substitutes' bench to seal the winning goal in dramatic circumstances. A climb back into the top four positions will be gratefully received by supporters who endured a dismal Premier League campaign last term, finishing 15th and languishing in the bottom half for most of the season.",
      "The victory has now propelled Michael Carrick's name to pole position as the clear frontrunner for the permanent role, with the former midfielder's odds slashed from 10/3 to 6/4 with bookmakers following a promising start to his caretaker stint. With consecutive Premier League victories for the first time since October - including last week's Manchester Derby triumph at Old Trafford - it presents a compelling case for Carrick assuming the position on a permanent basis.",

      "\"Sunday's gutsy win against the Gunners has seen Carrick's odds of being United boss for the start of the 2026/27 season plummet to 6/4 from 10/3, meaning he's now the clear favourite. Oliver Glasner is out to 4/1 from 5/2 as a result, while Gareth Southgate is quietly sitting third in the betting at 8/1.\"",
      "The two names previously mentioned would mean United wouldn't need to pay any compensation fees, as Glasner revealed his plans to depart Crystal Palace at the season's end following their FA Cup defeat to non-league Macclesfield and captain Marc Guehi's transfer to Manchester City.",
      "Additional contenders include Aston Villa's Unai Emery, who has steered his team to within four points of Arsenal, whilst former Brighton and Hove Albion manager Roberto De Zerbi also features in the odds market, with both bosses priced at 20/1.",

      "Chelsea's Cole Palmer would be open to a move to Manchester United(Image: Harry Murphy)",
      "Cole Palmer would supposedly be open to a sensational summer move to his boyhood club, Manchester United, amid fresh claims that he is currently unsettled at Chelsea.",
      "Palmer, 23, moved to London from Manchester City in a £42.5million transfer two-and-a-half years ago. He has grown into one of the Blues' most influential attacking players - but the England star is now being linked with a surprise switch back to the North West.",
      "According to The Sun, Palmer would 'welcome' interest from Manchester United, the club he grew up supporting, should they show any desire to bring him to Old Trafford. He would not, though, consider making a return to City, where he came through the academy ranks, while Pep Guardiola remains in charge.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United's director of football, saw Palmer firsthand during his journey through the City academy due to his previous role with the club and is known to be a huge admirer of a player who scored 15 goals and registered eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "The report adds that Palmer, who signed an improved contract which runs until 2033 just last season, misses his hometown of Wythenshawe.",
      "Palmer is said to be homesick after two-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge(Image: Photo by Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "Injuries have dogged Palmer in the 2025-26 campaign, restricting him to just 13 appearances for Chelsea. He did not feature in Sunday's 3-1 win over Crystal Palace due to a thigh issue, something Liam Rosenior confirmed pre-match.",
      "Rosenior has already addressed transfer speculation amid claims that Palmer is homesick in the capital.",
      "\"I've had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems very happy to be here,\" the new Blues head coach said last week. \"He's a huge part in our long-term plans.",
      "\"My job and the club's job is to get him into a situation where he can consistently perform to the level he wants to. There was frustration in the Brentford game. We need to look after him and that's why I didn't involve him in the last game.\"",

Ex-referee Mark Clattenburg insists that officials need to take a tougher stance to prevent attacking teams from exploiting such situations.",

      "\"It's clear that this has become more common when set-piece coaches were employed by clubs to get any advantage possible,\" Clattenburg told United In Focus. \"It's something the PGMOL and Premier League need to address, and any blocking on the goalkeeper must be punished by a free-kick.",

      "New boss Michael Carrick has managed to extract the best from his United squad during his second tenure in charge, securing a 2-0 victory against rivals Manchester City before boldly dismantling Premier League frontrunners Arsenal 3-2 on Sunday night.",
      "The encounter was level at the break, but moments into the second half, some slick interplay between Dorgu and Bruno Fernandes bore fruit. The Danish ace was teed up for a strike from outside the penalty area and unleashed a superb half-volley that flew past David Raya via the crossbar.",
      "Dorgu exhibited remarkable confidence throughout the encounter before being withdrawn in the 81st minute following an injury. Yet such self-assurance is precisely what former boss Amorim failed to witness in the youngster just months earlier.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The 21-year-old was acquired by United from Lecce in February 2025 for £25million in an attempt to provide then-boss Amorim with another alternative at the left wing-back role.",
      "However, he struggled to find his rhythm during the latter half of last season and failed to register a goal or assist in the Premier League, despite featuring from the start in 10 matches. He kicked off the current campaign as a regular in the starting XI but quickly found himself relegated to the substitutes' bench.",
      "In November, Amorim discussed Dorgu's displays following a 1-0 defeat to Everton, drawing comparisons between his club performances and a goal-scoring appearance for Denmark against Scotland in a friendly weeks earlier.",
      "The Dane scored United's second goal with a brilliant half-volley(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I think it's the decision [making]. He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim acknowledged last November prior to his sacking in January.",
      "A particular 11 words from Amorim's assessment carry special significance as he went on: \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball.",
      "\"I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make against the guys [for Denmark] from Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Dorgu has proved Amorim's claim wrong(Image: Getty)",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo and Amad departed to represent their nations at the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim started deploying Dorgu in more attacking positions and he has appeared a transformed player.",
      "Following United's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa in December, Dorgu has featured in virtually every minute of his side's subsequent six fixtures in an advanced role and has contributed three goals and an assist. His team remain undefeated throughout this spell.",
      "Even following Amorim's sacking and Carrick's appointment, he has maintained this impressive run of assured performances, comprehensively dispelling his previous manager's suggestion that he plays with a degree of nervousness.",

      "Marcus Rashford is spending the season on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United(Image: Thomas Eisenhuth - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have suffered a setback in their pursuit of a Barcelona midfielder, which could have implications for Marcus Rashford's future. United sent Rashford on loan to the La Liga club last summer for the campaign, with the England international making a strong impression during his spell in Spain.",
      "Rashford indicated his wish to depart United during pre-season last summer, and subsequently joined Barcelona on loan with uncertainty surrounding his Old Trafford future.",
      "Since arriving at Barca, Rashford has netted eight goals and contributed 12 assists for the La Liga side, and has been tipped to secure a permanent switch at the end of the season. Beyond the ongoing speculation regarding Rashford's situation, United have been linked with a potential move for Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado.",
      "Barcelona secured a comfortable 3-0 triumph over Real Oviedo in La Liga on Sunday evening, with Casado instrumental in the victory at the Camp Nou.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "United have been strongly linked with signing a new midfielder this year, with Casado among the names mentioned as a possible option to replace Casemiro this summer. With United reportedly pursuing Casado, there have also been tentative rumours of a swap deal involving Rashford being finalised for this summer.",
      "Nevertheless, the prospects of any sort of agreement for Casado and United appear unlikely after Barcelona manager Hansi Flick ruled out the possibility of the midfielder departing the Camp Nou.",
      "“For me, there’s no question of him leaving,” said Flick. “We need everyone. Marc is a super professional player.",
      "“He deserved to play today [vs Real Oviedo]. He’s worked hard. I liked what I saw. That’s the Casado we want to see.”",
      "Marc Casado of Barcelona has been linked with Manchester United(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "Recent reports have suggested that, should Casado depart Barca, he would favour joining a club abroad rather than in Spain.",
      "United have until February 2 to finalise their transfer activity for the month, though it remains uncertain whether they'll manage to secure any new additions to their squad.",
      "Flick has already delivered a stern message to Barcelona players, both within the first-team setup and the La Masia academy, which emerged as Dro Fernandez moves closer to a switch to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "\"If you want to play for Barca, you have to give everything...100 per cent,” Flick stated earlier this month.",
      "“That's what I want to say to everyone who is with us now or could be with us in the future. Same applies for La Masia youngsters training with the first team.",
      "\"They have to be here 100 per cent. These colours must be defended, that's what I want to see. As for the rest, I don't want them.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will have to break the bank to keep Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford this summer. Fernandes is considering his Old Trafford future - and will be inundated with offers from other clubs at the end of the season.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder has become disillusioned with how the club is run and the managerial changes. He came close to leaving United last summer, but rejected the chance to join the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The United captain will wait until the end of this season before deciding his next move. While Fernandes has been impressed with the impact Michael Carrick has made as interim manager, he wants to see who the next permanent boss will be.",
      "The 31-year-old knows his next deal will be the last major one of his career and that he needs to cash in. He also knows United bosses are desperate for him not to leave.",
      "United will stand a better chance of keeping Fernandes if they can offer him Champions League football. But club chiefs will still have to offer Fernandes a deal in the region of £400,000-a-week, making him the highest-paid player.",
      "This would be a significant increase on his current contract, which runs until 2027 and has the option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Fernandes knows his value to United - and wants to maximise it. It remains to be seen if United would be willing to hand such a deal to someone in their 30s.",
      "He would have no sell on value come the end of any new deal.",
      "But with Casemiro poised to leave in the summer, United will be getting rid of someone on £400,000-a-week, making them more flexible financially.",

      "Former footballer Gordon McQueen's brain showed evidence of damage from heading the ball which contributed to his death, an inquest ruled today.",
      "The Scottish legend died from pneumonia, vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, which the coroner said was linked to heading the ball.",
      "Footballing greats Bryan Robson, Gary Bailey, Lou Macari and Joe Jordan gave evidence that McQueen was consistenly asked to head the ball in both defending and attacking situations in training.",
      "Prof Willie Stewart, a consultant at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow who examined McQueen's brain after his death, said that CTE was present.",
      "North Yorkshire senior coroner Jonathan Heath ruled that post mortem examination had found evidence of the damage caused by heading during his career.",
      "Giving a narrative verdict, he said: \"The post mortem examination confirmed the presence of CTE. The cause of death was pneumonia in the lower lung likely to be as a consequence of his vascular dementia.",
      "\"It is also likely that the impact of heading the ball contributed to his CTE. The condition has to be considered as a factor in his cause of death.\"",
      "The conclusion was that McQueen had died from pneumonia, vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "In a statement following the inquest, the McQueen family said Gordon did not simply die with CTE – he lived with it.",
      "”Gordon loved football, but the later years of his life were incredibly diﬃcult” the family said.",
      "Experts increasingly warn that CTE begins in youth, develops silently over many years and that it is not confined to elite football, but can aﬀect players from grassroots through to the professional game, wherever repetitive head impacts occur.",
      "Hayley McQueen, daughter of Scotland legend Gordon(Image: Daily Record)",
      "Gordon McQueen with daughter Hayley(Image: Daily Record)",
      "Head Safe Football, a registered charity dedicated to player welfare, said the McQueen inquest should act as a catalyst for meaningful change.",
      "“Gordon’s story shows why football must take action to protect its future” Dr. Judith Gates, chair and Co-founder of Head Safe Football said.",
      "\"Living with CTE is devastating, both to the aﬀected players and to their families.",
      "\"Because exposure begins early and accumulates over time, reduction in heading should start with young players and then be applied to every level.",
      "\"The message from Head Safe Football is simple. Think head safe: reduce heading in training.\"",
      "Man Utd and Scotland legend McQueen was diagnosed with vascular dementia, and died in 2023 aged 70.",
      "She told the hearing in Northallerton, North Yorkshire: \"He would say 'yes, heading a football all those years probably hasn't helped'. I remember coming home from school and Dad would be in bed. Or having a lie down.",
      "\"He would say he's been having headaches. I remember thinking 'why are you having headaches?'\" McQueen made almost 350 appearances for St Mirren, Leeds and United between 1970 and 1985.",
      "Hayley told the inquest she did not remember him having head injuries during his career, other than a few concussions.",
      "Gordon McQueen was a towering defender(Image: Popperfoto via Getty Images)",
      "But she outlined how loved ones noticed a change in his personality not long after his 60th birthday. He struggled with his swallowing and that \"continued for many years,\" Hayley said.",
      "\"His balance was very, very off and his personality started to change. My dad was very outgoing, dinners, part of the after-dinner circuit. He became off, which wasn't really my dad.\"",
      "Dysphagia caused the problem with swallowing, though McQueen had also been diagnosed with throat cancer. \"He just wouldn't really know what year it was or what day it was,\" Hayley added.",
      "\"He was very active and trying to do crosswords and watch football. He lost the ability to write. He couldn't make a cup of tea. He got confused about what went where. He kept saying, 'there's something not right in my head'. He used to get confused about things. Never people - he had an incredible memory for the past.",
      "\"It was more the withdrawn nature of my dad. He would be the centre of attention, but he had to be asked a question to speak.\"",
      "Michael Rawlinson KC, representing the McQueen family, asked how her father scored his goals.",
      "She replied: \"Mainly with his head, from a set-piece.\" They learned more about his illness after her mum Yvonne spoke with Dawn Astle, daughter of ex-England striker Jeff Astle, who had the brain condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and died in 2002 aged 59.",
      "Prof Stewart, a consultant at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow who examined McQueen's brain after his death, said that CTE was present.",
      "\"Gordon technically fell into the lower stage of the disease, although on the threshold of the higher stage,\" he added.",
      "Prof Stewart said symptoms of CTE were cognitive decline and neuro-behaviour change, and that they \"can't be explained by another condition.\"",
      "He said symptoms were \"typical in individuals who have long careers, professional footballers and rugby players\". Asked if there was a causal link between CTE and repetitive head injury, he replied: \"The answer to that is yes.\"",
      "Mr Heath said the post-mortem found pneumonia in McQueen's right lung, mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "Prof Stewart, who conducted a 2021 study on whether certain positions on the pitch were more associated with neurodegenerative disease than others, said: \"The players, the goalkeepers who don't head the ball had a risk equivalent to general population, whereas in outfield positions, particularly defenders, the risk was higher.\"",

      "Greenwood, 24, has scored 42 goals in 64 appearances for Marseille since then. His initial signing was widely criticised, with Greenwood having faced allegations of attempted rape, assault and coercive control - those charges later being dropped by the CPS.",
      "Longoria has now opened up on the decision to bring Greenwood to the Stade Velodrome in the face of the controversy, having sought advice from his mum. Speaking in an interview with The Telegraph, he said: “For me, it’s correct to speak openly about it.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“In that case, having done due diligence and having all the information – and this is the first time I speak about this – with all the information I called my mother. And I said ‘what do you think, knowing all the situation?’",
      "“And my mother, who used to work in the prison system in Spain, having a very innovative prison system model in Spain – she was recognised with the medal of the state – so I ask her, having all this information, ‘what would you do in my position?’ And she said to me ‘do it’. With all the information.",
      "“It was important because I wanted someone who doesn’t have the incentive of the sport, because the talent is there, that her only incentive is the good of her son. As a man, not as a president. And, for me, it was very important that she said to me, knowing all of this, ‘do it’.”",

I think that it can be as well for him necessary because we are seeing that Mason this season is not the Mason of last season. I expect that he’s continuing to grow up and I would like to help him as well, you know, being better each day.”",

      "Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United lasted only 14 months(Image: 2025 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United came to an abrupt end after plenty of frustrations on and off the pitch. His squad struggled to adapt to his 3-4-3 formation and, following a period of inconsistent results and growing tensions with the hierarchy, Amorim was dismissed barely a week into the new year.",
      "One aspect that became crystal clear during his tenure at United was his dissatisfaction with Marcus Rashford. A player who had served the club for a decade, Rashford is now on loan at Barcelona and it looks increasingly probable that Hansi Flick will make the forward's move permanent at the end of the campaign.",
      "Amorim voiced concerns about Rashford's work rate under his management and didn't hold back after a fixture against Fulham in 2025. \"It's always the same reason - the training, the way I see a footballer should do in life. It's every day, every detail,\" he said. \"If things don't change, I will not change.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"It's the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player. You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench, but I would put [Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\"",
      "The jibe about Vital, Amorim's 64-year-old goalkeeping coach, effectively sealed Rashford's fate at United. Having been largely frozen out shortly after the Portuguese coach arrived, he found temporary sanctuary at Aston Villa before securing his dream transfer to La Liga last summer.",
      "Amorim later admitted he found it difficult to get Rashford to embrace his philosophy. \"What I say is I couldn't put Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it,\" he said.",
      "\"And sometimes you have one player who is really good with one coach and the same player with another coach is different. I just wish the best to Rashford and Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",
      "Amorim and Mourinho had similar frustrations(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Amorim isn't the first manager to raise concerns about Rashford's work ethic. Both Erik ten Hag and Jose Mourinho have previously questioned the England international's attitude, with the Special One sharing similar views to his compatriot.",
      "In a conversation with Hristo Stoichkov in 2018 following his own exit from Old Trafford, Mourinho famously remarked: \"I think kids these days have a different social life than us, and players have around them an entourage, and I mean a personal entourage, the people that surround them, that protect them more, give them more affection, more excuses. They reach maturity more slowly.",
      "\"When we talk about Luke Shaw, [Anthony] Martial, [Jesse] Lingard, [Marcus] Rashford, we're talking about kids with great potential but still lack a word I can't say but that you like a lot... they lack a bit of that. Character, personality, as they say in Spain as well, bad blood, that natural aggression that you had.\"",
      "Fellow former United manager Ten Hag identified what concerned him about Rashford. \"I think he always knew. Every player knows, when your lifestyle is not right you can't perform in the league we have to perform in,\" he said.",
      "Jose Mourinho won the Europa League with Manchester United(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"You don't get the right levels if you don't have a good and disciplined life away from Carrington. He needed some help, by backing him, for instance.",
      "\"But he has to do it himself, at the end of the day. He has to set his life right, his training attitude right, he has to set his match attitude right. When he sets his professionalism he will perform because he's a class player.\"",
      "According to a report from The Athletic, Barcelona are keen to retain Rashford beyond his loan spell, which could signal a permanent departure from United.",

      "Ratcliffe spoke to Michael Carrick, and then he disappeared back up the lift with the Ineos delegation. When he emerged again to leave the stadium, he was asked if he could speak to reporters. \"No, no, no,\" he said before adding, \"just get the smile\" and gesturing that his lips were sealed.",

      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro strolled through together. A Portuguese-speaking journalist pleaded with the pair to speak, and Fernandes explained why they had declined to do so in his mother tongue.",
      "Patrick Dorgu scored a stunning goal to fire United into a 2-1 lead at the Emirates. He came off in discomfort with nine minutes remaining, and Michael Carrick said in his press conference that Dorgu had suffered from cramp, but the in-form Denmark international left the stadium with a limp.",
      "When Dorgu was asked how his injury was, he said: \"We'll see.\" The 21-year-old's confidence is flowing after an impressive few weeks in a United shirt, and fans will be hoping he was substituted due to cramp, as Carrick suggested, not because he'd picked up a knock.",
      "Dorgu scored a screamer.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Jonathan Woodgate chatted to a reporter who he recognised from his Real Madrid days, while Steve Holland took a minute to pause and check his phone before getting on the team bus.",
      "A few minutes earlier, Arsenal defender Ben White had left the Emirates. White has not played for the Three Lions since his withdrawal from the England squad at the 2022 Qatar World Cup, when Holland reportedly said that White, who does not watch football, wasn't interested enough in the game.",
      "Gareth Southgate insisted there had never been an issue, and White's withdrawal from the England squad was put down to \"personal reasons.\" It would have been interesting if their exits from the Emirates had coincided, though. It feels most likely that there would have been no acknowledgement.",
      "Holland lives and breathes football. He arrived at Carrington with bags of experience, and wins against Manchester City and Arsenal confirm he was a shrewd addition to Carrick's backroom staff.",
      "United's communications department has undergone a recent change, leaving the head of football communications overstretched on matchdays over the last month. A new staff member is set to arrive, but the head of football communications has essentially been left to deal with the media on their own.",
      "They were pushed for time to bring a player out to Manchester-correspondents in the mixed zone, to accompany players doing interviews with rights holders, and Michael Carrick at the press conference, but there is a 'proper' mixed zone at the Emirates, which means players must walk past journalists to leave.",
      "That means there is a chance a player will stop. Senne Lammens was happy to oblige, and he spoke for three minutes, reacting to the result and discussing the impact of Carrick so far.",
      "Lammens also took time to chat after the win at Anfield in October. He is mature beyond his years and speaks well. \"It's something I really look forward to - these big away games,\" he smiled.",
      "There was no comment from Gunnersaurus Rex, Arsenal's mascot, when asked whether he could front up about his team's performance. It's starting to feel like Arsenal last won the title when dinosaurs roamed the land.",
      "Gunnersaurus Rex was not in the mood to speak.(Image: Steven Railston)",
      "A disagreement erupted between two Arsenal fans beside the press box shortly after Dorgu's goal. The club's stewards were called to the incident, and the pair were prevented from exchanging blows.",
      "The pair began to argue again when Matheus Cunha scored the match-winner. There were further signs of discontent after the final whistle when fans huddled outside the stadium to record reaction for AFTV.",
      "AFTV is a well-known, fan-led Arsenal YouTube channel. The channel's popularity soared during the final years of Arsene Wenger's tenure, with personalities giving unfiltered - and often exaggerated - opinions.",
      "The Gunners were heavy favourites to win, but United caused an upset. The meltdown in the stands and outside the ground showed how much the defeat hurt their supporters.",
      "Arsenal fans held an inquest well after the final whistle.(Image: )",
      "There were chants of \"he's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes,\" when arriving at London King's Cross to begin the return journey to Manchester.",

At 1pm, they strolled over to watch the Under-21s take on Brighton in the Premier League 2 at Carrington.",
      "That is the third academy game since Carrick took over and the third he has attended. The diligence of the 44-year-old and his staff has been noted around the building. Two weeks ago, the mood at Old Trafford was one of despondency. When United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton, the picture had become clear. There were 17 Premier League games remaining, and that was it. Another season of drift looked set for a long, drawn-out conclusion.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "There was no anger towards Darren Fletcher after that FA Cup exit. The Scot had been a safe pair of hands for a week after the chaos of Ruben Amorim's exit, but it felt like nobody was enjoying themselves any more. Not the players, and definitely not the supporters.",
      "Contrast that with the scenes in the away end at the Emirates on Sunday. Fifteen minutes after the final whistle had blown, there were United fans still there, slowly drifting towards the exit and the North London night. \"It's Carrick, you know...\" could be heard echoing back up into the stands.",
      "Inside the bowels of the stadium, Carrick was just about to speak to Norwegian broadcaster Viaplay when he was pulled away for a meeting with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. It wasn't a job offer yet, but if this carries on, one might not be too far away.",
      "Although you could argue this is just a continuation of his three-game spell as caretaker in November 2021. To the wins against Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta and a draw against Thomas Tuchel, he has added a victory against Pep Guardiola and another success against Arteta. It is shaping up as a seriously impressive coaching CV at the highest level.",
      "United got the Carrick era off to a winning start against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "Carrick has been unflappable since taking the reins from Fletcher. He is unobtrusive, low-key and has his feet planted so firmly on the floor that it's a surprise it isn't a challenge to lift them when he needs to move. He showed little emotion on the touchline on Sunday, only coming to life in front of the away end at full-time, with his two children among the 3,000 or so away supporters.",
      "It might have felt strange for them to be singing a song in their dad's honour, but then they might have been the only ones not doing so. Carrick has eschewed grand statements since his return. There has been no mention of chats with Sir Alex Ferguson, no real mention of his playing days or past glories. When it was put to him that United could do with a midfielder like Carrick now, he was self-effacing and made fun of himself.",
      "There has been no schmaltz or nostalgia since his return. This hasn't been a renaissance built on someone talking about the United DNA, but on someone delivering the United DNA. Two very different performances have produced the same result.",
      "This is a triumph of substance over style. It's been built on the training ground as much as Carrick is taking the plaudits now, he knows the work of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion is essential to what they have delivered in the space of two weeks.",
      "For 14 months, Ruben Amorim wanted more time on the training pitches, but when he got what he wished for, he made little use of it. Whether the blame for that lies with Amorim or his experienced backroom team, it's clear that this thrown-together coaching set-up under Carrick is maximising the time they have.",
      "They had three sessions to prepare for Manchester City and delivered a game plan to dominate the derby and play front-foot, counter-attacking football. They then had a full week to come up with a strategy for the trip to Arsenal and delivered an approach that blocked space and offered the hosts nothing from open play.",
      "You can see the players have brought into it. Holland deserves plenty of plaudits as well. He is the most experienced member of the coaching staff and the Mancunian has quickly won the respect of the squad.",
      "The challenge for Carrick and co will change now. They have delivered tactical successes in games in which they were outsiders, but against Fulham on Sunday, United will have the ball and need to dictate the game. That will call for a change of focus this week.",
      "Cunha celebrates his dramatic late winner against Arsenal(Image: )",
      "Carrick said after the win at the Emirates that there were \"layers\" still to add to the game plan and things to improve. Some of that will be related to breaking down a low block. United's kryptonite recently has been beating teams at home that they should be beating.",
      "If they do that and do it with style, then the clamour for Carrick will only grow. The man himself is refusing to say whether he even wants the job.",
      "\"I am here to do a job,\" he said on Sunday \"When I came here less than two weeks ago, I said we would make every decision for the bigger picture.",
      "\"We are not getting carried away. It is two huge results, but we will keep our feet on the ground. I am enjoying it and I will continue to do what I can.\"",
      "That has been more than good enough so far, but a different kind of test awaits this week.",

      "Lammens took time to chat at the Emirates.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Senne Lammens has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke to Michael Carrick after Manchester United's win against Arsenal. United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory at the Emirates thanks to a late goal from Matheus Cunha, which condemned Arsenal to a first home defeat in the Premier League this season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo equalised in the first half and Patrick Dorgu scored a stunning goal to fire United into the lead. Mikel Merino thought he'd salvaged a point for Arsenal when he scored with seven minutes remaining, but there was another twist when Cunha found the net to seal an away victory.",
      "Ratcliffe attended the game with Omar Berrada, United CEO, and Jason Wilcox, United football director. After full-time, the Ineos entourage was spotted making its way to the dressing room area within the Emirates. Lammens was asked whether Ratcliffe had popped into the dressing room to speak to the players, and he responded: \"No, I just saw him there when we came out of the dressing room.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"He was talking to the coach. It's nice to see them [United board] as well, like supporting the team as well, as they have. So it's always a good feeling and good support for them.\"",
      "Lammens has made a strong impact since signing for £18.2million from Royal Antwerp in the summer. \"I think it was one of the better ones, better feelings of my career,\" he said of the win over the Gunners.",
      "\"Away as well, yeah, whilst last week [against City] was at home, which is also really nice and really special. This one felt like a little bit more hard work. It wasn't always the best play from us, but they also games you have to win if you want to be at the top.",
      "\"So today we did that, I think just hardworking, defending together, and then at the end, the subs like Cunha made a difference, and also, the people who come in give our team energy.\"",
      "Lammens claims the ball at the Emirates.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Michael Carrick has overseen wins over Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games since his appointment as head coach, and Lammens put the team's improvement down to going back to basics.",
      "\"To be honest, there's not many special things he did. It's just like sticking to the basics,\" said Lammens. \"Football is basics. If you do the basics well, then the quality of us comes out, and I think we have players with the quality that can make the difference.",
      "\"But if you just do the basics right technically, we're standing right, defending good together. And just [playing] as a team, to be honest, he made it really clear what he wants from us and what he expects from us.",
      "\"And I think today as well, on the pitch sometimes it [the plan] didn't really come out, but if you fight as a team and if you keep believing in it, then you can still get the win.\"",
      "When asked about Carrick's post-match message to the players, Lammens said: \"To be honest, the same things. It wasn't the prettiest game, but those were the most difficult ones. Last week was, I think, in every aspect, a good game. I think we play really well. Today was not always perfect.",
      "\"But like I said before, if you work hard as a team, you can always win. And now it's up to us. We're there, top four, to stay there and to even look above us. Those games against those top teams, you have to win.",
      "\"But now the coming weeks, when they expect more from us, when we are the favourite to win, then you also have to pull through and those are also really important games.\"",
      "United welcome Fulham to Old Trafford next weekend. \"They are sometimes the most difficult ones, the ones you have to win, so to speak,\" he said. \"It's still a long way from the end of the season, so we don't want to look at the end. Like at the table, but yeah, we know we're there [top four].",
      "\"We know we can play against those better teams, so now we have to win against those teams who are maybe a little bit more difficult to play against, playing against low blocks. If you want to be a great team, you have to win against those teams as well.\"",

      "Michael Carrick told his Manchester United players to keep their feet on the ground and stay humble after they backed up a derby day win by beating Premier League leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, with Matheus Cunha's late winner securing a stunning victory.",
      "United have beaten the Premier League's top two in Carrick's first two games in charge and now sit fourth with 15 games of the season to go. That puts Champions League qualification well within their grasp, but the 44-year-old is refusing to get carried away.",
      "Carrick has had an immediate impact since replacing Ruben Amorim, and these wins have sent out a statement about their intentions this season after a disappointing run of results in December, but one of the former United midfielder's strengths has been a calm demeanour, and he isn't about to misplace that now.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Although the away end revelled in a victory that hurt Arsenal's title chances, Carrick was focusing on the impact he could have within the club, rather than the statement it can send out to the rest of the league, and he is determined to make sure his players do not get carried away.",
      "\"I think it's more about the feeling that gives us as a group,\" he said. \"And the players and certainly the supporters, you know? That's my concern, how that can bring us together and lift us in a real positive manner.",
      "\"I'm not getting carried away. We've got some bigger games coming up, because every next game's the bigger game. So we're not getting carried away, we've got really important things coming up that we need to kind of keep improving with.",

      "United fans were chanting 'we're gonna win the league' as they left the Emirates but Carrick didn't flinch when told that in his post-match press conference, instead returning to a theme of focusing on Fulham next week rather than getting sucked into looking at the bigger picture.",
      "\"I know from our perspective it's just moving forward to the next game,\" he said. \"It's been less than two weeks that we've been together, so it's just keep getting good habits really, and good routines. The boys have been fantastic with that.",
      "\"I don't think we can look too far ahead. We certainly won't be anyway. We'll finish where we finish by the results we get. I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really so we've taken this week by week and game by game.",
      "\"We'll certainly continue to do that, but we've got to ride it. You've got to use the emotion, you've got to use the energy, you've got to use the confidence, but be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results and it doesn't just come easy. So we need to continue that and bottle it and use it again.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to the MEN's Manchester United live blog on Tuesday, January 27.",
      "The feel-good factor is well and truly back at Old Trafford after back-to-back wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. Matheus Cunha's superb winner lifted Michael Carrick's men into the Premier League top four places.",
      "United are next in action on Sunday when they take on Fulham. Until then, attention returns to the January transfer window. The window closes next Monday and there could be a number of twists still to play out.",
      "A new midfielder is at the top of the list for United after it was confirmed that Casemiro would leave the club at the end of the season. However, Cole Palmer is the surprising big name to be linked following reports of his desire to return to Manchester.",
      "Palmer was a United fan growing up before coming through the Manchester City academy. After moving to Chelsea, the England international has established himself as one of the Premier League's best attackers.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With that being said, we will bring you all the latest news throughout the day...",
      "Talks between Manchester United and Galatasaray will commence today regarding Manuel Ugarte, according to Turkish journalist Suleyman Rodop.",
      "The Super Lig side want to loan the midfielder until the end of the season, with an option to purchase. “Galatasaray’s critical meeting on the transfer will be tomorrow. Galatasaray and Ugarte (the player’s camp) sit down at the table tomorrow and the expected meeting will take place,\" he said.",
      "\"If Manchester United accepts a purchase option on Ugarte and loans him, they will complete the transfer.\"",
      "Paul Scholes believes Michael Carrick would suit one of Man United's rivals after insisting the club won't make his stay a permanent one at the end of the season.",
      "Despite beating Manchester City and Arsenal, speculation has fuelled suggestions that he could become the permanent head coach. After claiming United will be 'scarred' by their previous experience of giving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the job on the back of an interim spell, Scholes then suggested he could return to Tottenham.",
      "\"It could be like a Tottenham manager from this [for Carrick]. It wouldn't surprise me,\" he said.",
      "TEAMtalk have reported that Man United are stepping up their interest to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace this summer.",
      "The report states that United want to make the 21-year-old their marquee signing over rivals Liverpool. Manchester City and Newcastle United are also keen after holding preliminary discussions with his entourage.",
      "Good morning and welcome to today's live Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "Stay tuned and we will bring you the news from Monday and the latest rumours today.",
      "Manuel Ugarte's representatives will meet with Galatasaray tomorrow, according to the Turkish journalist Suleyman Rodop [via Habersarikirmizi and Sport Witness].",
      "They are reportedly hopeful that United will agree to include an option to make a potential loan move permanent. It is said that only then will Galatasaray sign the midfielder.",
      "TEAMtalk also report that United are increasing their interest in Adam Wharton by making informal approaches to ascertain the player's availability this summer.",
      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle United are three other clubs said to have held preliminary discussions with the player's representatives. The former are reportedly aggressive suitors.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told United about Wilfred Ndidi's potential availability this winter during discussions with the club about returning as their head coach until the end of this season, according to TEAMtalk.",
      "Despite appointing Michael Carrick instead of the Norwegian, the outlet claims United are making a move for the midfielder. Solskjaer coached Ndidi at Besiktas before being sacked by the Turkish club last summer.",
      "Emiliano Martinez could leave Aston Villa for as little as £30million, according to Pete O'Rourke, after United previously showed interest in the goalkeeper.",
      "O'Rourke said on the latest edition of Football Insider’s Transfer Insider podcast:",
      "It won't be an easy deal to do, due to probably the fee Villa would look for him would be pretty high. He's under contract until 2029 so you'd be looking around £30-40million plus probably for a player like Martinez, who is one of the big earners at Villa Park.",
      "Juventus are considering signing Joshua Zirkzee, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They are reportedly weighing up their options after a delay in completing a deal to sign Youssef En-Nesyri from Fenerbahce. Jean-Philippe Mateta is said to be another striker on their shortlist should they not be able to sign the Morocco international.",
      "United are not currently proceeding with a move to sign Wilfred Ndidi, according to Fabrizio Romano, despite being offered the player.",
      "Romano said in a YouTube video uploaded over the weekend:",
      "Man United again have been offered the possibility to go for Ndidi, but at the moment still not proceeding.",
      "Cole Palmer would welcome interest from United after becoming unsettled in London, according to The Sun.",
      "A return to City, though, is reportedly something that the Chelsea player would not consider. Palmer is said to miss Wythenshawe, regularly visiting his hometown to spend time with family and friends who still live there.",
      "Crystal Palace are keen on bringing Andoni Iraola to Selhurst Park when Oliver Glasner leaves the club.",
      "Iraola has been linked with the Man United permanent job after impressing at Bournemouth. However, Pete O'Rourke has claimed that Palace are set to rival United for his signature in the summer.",
      "Former scout Mick Brown has revealed that West Ham are keen on signing Harry Maguire.",
      "Speaking to GiveMeSport, he said: “West Ham won’t be the only interested club because there are a few in the Premier League who could do with a player like that, but like I say, they’ve wanted him for years.",
      "“They’ll be keeping an eye on what happens with his contract at Man United and if he’s going to be available, yeah, I think it would be a good move.”",
      "Manchester United will have to break the bank to keep Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder has become disillusioned with how the club is run and the managerial changes. He came close to leaving United last summer, but rejected the chance to join the Saudi Pro League.",
      "United will stand a better chance of keeping Fernandes if they can offer him Champions League football. But club chiefs will still have to offer Fernandes a deal in the region of £400,000-a-week, making him the highest-paid player.",
      "This would be a significant increase on his current contract, which runs until 2027 and has the option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man United have reportedly revived their interest in striker Vitor Roque. Radip Tupi (via Sport Witness) have claimed United want to sign him after he impressed in his first season in Brazil.",
      "Roque moved back to Palmeiras after a difficult spell with Barcelona. He scored 20 goals in 59 games last season. A January move is unlikely with the Brazilian side keen on retaining him until the summer.",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe was delighted after Manchester United’s win over Arsenal. Carrick was summoned for talks with Ratcliffe in the Emirates Stadium tunnel after the Reds moved into the top four with a 3-2 victory over the Gunners.",
      "Asked what was said, he said: “No, not much as you would expect, I think. There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”",

      "Juventus have now turned their attention to Zirkzee and Liverpool's Federico Chiesa, according to La Gazetta dello Sport.",
      "Director of Football Strategy Giorgio Chiellini is believed to be eager to bring in players with proven Serie A experience, and he believes both could be signed for less than their full market value.",
      "Gary Neville argued that Michael Carrick has succeeded in stripping things back for Man United in a way Ruben Amorim never quite managed, even though the Portuguese manager imposed a strict, no‑nonsense approach that demanded clear, concise instructions without overwhelming players with detail.Speaking on his 'The Gary Neville podcast' about the Reds' quick turnaround, Neville said: \"Michael Carrick, he's definitely instilled the simplicity of it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, it's my favourite system.",
      "\"We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. Still not at a point to get carried away but certainly at a point to suggest now that Manchester United have an unbelievable opportunity from where they were, ten/two weeks ago before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point, it's a remarkable turn around.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "West Ham have reportedly been linked with a move for Maguire on a free transfer, with the defender out of contract at Man United in the summer.",

      "Chelsea are also said to have emerged as surprise contenders for his signature.",
      "Wharton has already made it clear to suitors such as Man United what he wants should he leave Crystal Palace.",
      "Wharton does his best to avoid speculation about his future or potential suitors. In fact, it’s usually family or friends who keep him informed about any talk surrounding his next move. \"I don’t really look into it or think too much about it,\" he said in November.",
      "\"There are always rumours floating about on social media. Is it true? Is it not? You tell me. My friends, my family, my brothers, everyone will message me and be like, ‘Is it true this club’s interested?’ I’m like, 'Thanks for telling me because I didn’t know.'",
      "\"I don’t know who’s spreading it or who at United is looking at it. I see it and I’m like, ‘OK’, and then I carry on with my day. United, the big teams, they’re all linked to 10, 20 different players. If I’m one of 20, then it’s nothing special, so it doesn’t really mean too much. I speak with my agent about planning ahead and possibilities.",
      "\"But at the end of the day, it is who’s interested and who’s willing to try and get you and if that becomes the case? You can speak about it, but you’ve got to represent that on the pitch and prove that you deserve it.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has handled Matheus Cunha superbly so far(Image: )",
      "The pent-up frustration and disappointment that Matheus Cunha felt at finding his place in the Manchester United team under threat for the first time came pouring out during his celebration at the Emirates. The Brazilian celebrated wildly with the away end before directing his anger down a camera lens.",
      "It's been a strange week or so for the 26-year-old Brazilian, who has found himself on the bench for successive Premier League games for the first time since his move from Wolves in the summer, but has also managed to deliver two decisive moments.",
      "Cunha came on for the final 19 minutes against Manchester City last week and produced a lively cameo. His clever runs offered an outlet to United and he created the goal with which Patrick Dorgu killed the game off.",
      "That wasn't enough to get him back in the team at Arsenal. This time, he got the final 21 minutes and again looked up for the fight. His contribution was even bigger, striding forward and curling a stunning goal into the corner of David Raya's net to earn United a famous victory.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Cunha has taken his goal contributions to seven in 22 games with his efforts over the past week, and once again, it looks like his Old Trafford career is threatening to kick into gear. Despite being signed as a perfect fit for Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, he only showed glimpses under the Portuguese head coach, and his best performances have come as a false nine.",
      "Speaking after the win at the Emirates, Michael Carrick massaged Cunha's ego, showering him with praise for the contribution he has made despite not starting either of his first two games in charge.",
      "\"Matheus coming on, a big impact again like he did last week,\" said Carrick. \"Creating a goal last week. I just fancied him to score when the ball came out of his feet.",
      "\"He kind of epitomises what we've been like this week. Matheus has not started both games, but he's had a real big impact. He's been disappointed not to start but he's used it in a really good way.",
      "\"Two huge moments and he totally deserves that winning goal for how he's applied himself, and I’m absolutely delighted.\"",
      "Carrick has made a bold call with leaving the £62.5million signing out so far, especially for Dorgu. As well as the young Dane has done, on stature and squad status, the safe decision would have been to start the big-money summer signing.",
      "These decisions are even harder for Carrick because of the lack of games to use his squad, which is now only missing Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee. In a normal season for United, Cunha could have started in Europe in midweek, but that isn't an option.",
      "There are only 15 games left this season and by the time of the Fulham game this weekend, Cunha will have played a little over 40 minutes in three weeks. That makes the challenge not only of rotation but also of keeping players happy all the more difficult for Carrick.",
      "So far, he has got it right with the Brazilian. Cunha has earned a start, although the problem is nobody deserves to be dropped either. Perhaps Dorgu's injury and the different game plan required to take on Fulham at Old Trafford will open a door.",
      "It certainly feels like Carrick needs to give him that. If he has kept him on side so far and managed to get him to channel his disappointment in the right way, that can quickly change if positive impacts off the bench only lead to more time on the bench.",
      "Cunha is doing the right things at Carrington. Like the rest of the squad, he has embraced the shorter, sharper sessions at Carrington and his form looks to be trending in the right direction again. He has done everything Carrick has asked of him in the past two weeks, and now it is time for that to be rewarded.",

      "Fletcher said: \"Shea Lacey's yellow card is ridiculous compared to the fouls that we had against us all game which ultimately then the lad makes a mistake and is sent off. For me, it is poor refereeing.\"",

      "Manchester United's players soak up the applauds after victory over Arsenal(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "Sunday afternoon was always going to be a tough ask for Manchester United and Michael Carrick in particular. Expectations were through the roof after the manner in which the Reds beat Manchester City the weekend prior and there was now belief this United team could turn up to the Emirates Stadium and win.",
      "That was despite Arsenal's ground becoming a fortress this season and the Gunners having not tasted defeat since the beginning of December. So with expectations skyrocketing and an opponent seemingly running away with the Premier League title, what were the chances of Carrick being able to mastermind another sensational victory?",
      "It turned out, those expectations were not to be feared. United were sensational in north London and became only the second team to beat Mikel Arteta's side when they have scored two or more goals. The other team to do that? Well, that was also United led by Carrick in 2021.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But it was more than just omens and good fortune which saw United defy the odds and beat the leaders on Sunday. MEN Sport has taken a look at seven things United did tactically which proved to be the undoing of Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "The connotations surrounding 'Park the Bus' are often negative due to some of the football we see from clubs who sit back. What we see from Carrick's system is how deep he likes his team to sit and invite pressure.",
      "On several occasions against the Gunners, you could see Amad and Patrick Dorgu drop into the defensive line, creating effectively a back six which Arsenal struggled to break down. United smothered the defence when the home side ventured into their half which made it impossible for the Gunners to play through the lines.",
      "Once United regained possession, Amad and Dorgu burst out of their holding roles to join the attack. Just as it was against City, the Reds were happy to not have the ball.",
      "Before the game, we all knew where United could be outdone - set pieces. The Reds are no strangers to scoring from corners and free kicks this season but it is Arsenal who have managed to perfect the craft.",
      "The Gunners tried a number of routines to unpick the Reds with only one working, (we will get onto that). But one tactical decision Carrick employed to counteract the Arsenal threat, was to give Harry Maguire a free role defensively.",
      "As Maguire is easily United's strongest header of the ball, it made sense to have him focused on watching its flight rather than being bogged down in a tussle with one of Arsenal's strapping centre halves. Speaking of which.",
      "United were caught out by one set piece in the game and were punished but, for the most part, they defended them well. Arsenal's tactic was to pile their aerial threats around Senne Lammens to cause chaos.",
      "When they attempted that, United's rebuttal was to try and do everything in their power to leave Lammens free so he could punch clear. The one time United were not able to stop the opposition, they conceded.",
      "Fortunately for the Reds, they were willing to embrace the battle and the scrappier side of the match. They played Arsenal at their own game and were victorious.",
      "Harry Maguire and Gabriel exchange a war of words during Manchester United's victory over Arsenal(Image: )",
      "It was not that long ago Jamie Carragher was on Monday Night Football expressing how Casemiro's legs had gone and football had left him. Sunday was yet more proof this long goodbye could be a brilliant swansong for the Brazilian.",
      "On paper, you would think Kobbie Mainoo was most likely to be the box-to-box midfielder in the United system but in reality, it was Casemiro pushing up towards the No.10 position when pressing and then dropping deep when Arsenal were on the front foot.",
      "When United were in possession and on the attack, Casemiro did well to shuttle play out onto the flanks from an advanced role. The Brazilian's passing range is underrated but few would have predicted him being capable of playing such a physically demanding position so well - but he did.",
      "What we saw too often last season was United's centre-forward - usually Rasmus Hojlund - struggling at the top of the pitch trying to perform the pressing duty solo. There are few players in the modern game who can do that for the entirety of a match.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is much more mobile and willing to do the unseen work but even he cannot do it for a full 90 minutes. The Cameroonian shared this responsibility with Amad and this allowed the forward to recharge his batteries so that when the time came, he was ready.",
      "The first goal proved United were more than just a team willing to sit back. When Gabriel received the ball, he was met with a wall of players in front of him.",
      "United were helped by Martin Odegaard not dropping back to support the defender but the initiative of Casemiro and Mainoo to step up and ensure the attack and midfield pressed as one was impressive. By the time Martin Zubimendi played the loose ball straight into Mbeumo's path, there was little more he could have done to avoid that outcome. It was a masterclass in pressing from the Reds.",
      "In the first half, Lammens overshot a long ball upfield towards Mbeumo and the Arsenal defence easily mopped up possession. Instead of lambasting his goalkeeper, the Cameroonian could be seen showing appreciation for the idea and it became clear why.",
      "With the score locked at 2-2, Lammens went long again and this time reached his target of Benjamin Sesko. Other than Matheus Cunha, Sesko played the biggest role in the winner.",
      "His strength and ability to knock the ball down for Fernandes opened the Arsenal defence up. It still required a moment of genius from Cunha but without having the focal point at the top of the pitch, United would not have scored a third.",

      "The youngster arrived at Barcelona aged 14, and made his Champions League bow in October, where he set up a goal as Barca demolished Olympiacos 6-1. Now, Fernandez has signed a contract that will keep him in the French capital until 2030.",
      "Flick was left frustrated with the situation, and when asked about it before the move, had to bite his tongue. \"Sometimes it's like that, that, yes, you do not agree with what they are doing, but they are 18, they are old enough to make decisions, they have people around them,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, when I see like...no, no, I don't want to talk anymore, it's enough.\"",

      "The former Bayern Munich boss spoke in glowing terms about Rashford's enthusiasm on loan from Manchester United and hoping for a transfer come the end of the season. \"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's [sporting director] Deco's job do things for next season,\" he said",
      "\"We have to wait. We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].",
      "\"This is what I want to say to young players from La Masia: We are Barca and we are one of the best teams in the world. We give them the opportunity to train with us, to grow, to train with the best players in the world, the support and the confidence.",
      "Dro Fernandez has left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain(Image: Angel Martinez/Getty Images)",

      "Laporta has now expressed his feelings about Fernandez's exit, but there could yet be more to reveal. \"We will talk when everything is finalised. It’s been an unpleasant situation,\" Laporta told Catalunya Radio.",
      "\"We will be able to resolve this situation as planned, but it’s been a surprise because we had agreed on a new solution with Dro when he turned 18, and surprisingly, his agent told us that he couldn’t fulfil the agreement.\"",
      "Speaking after the move, Fernandez mentioned PSG's pedigree as a motivating factor. \"I'm very happy and very proud to be joining Paris Saint-Germain,\" he said.",
      "\"This is a moment of huge pride for me and for my family. PSG is a massive club that I've followed since I was a child and where some great legends have made history. Right now, I'm hugely excited and motivated to play and to give everything for this shirt.\"",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of the season. United have taken the unusual step of announcing five months before the Brazilian's contract was due to expire that he will be leaving the club this summer.",
      "The 33-year-old moved to Old Trafford from Real Madrid in August 2022 for a fee rising to £70million, signing a four-year deal with an option for a further season. But the club have decided against triggering that extension, and the MEN understands the decision was made well before Thursday's announcement as part of their long-term planning.",
      "The MEN also understands that Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option and asked the club to make their plans public in order to \"bring external clarity\" to the situation.",
      "Casemiro, who has scored 21 goals in 146 appearances for United so far, said: \"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life.",
      "\"From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months.",
      "\"We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",
      "The midfielder, who won the Carabao Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup a year later, also said in a separate post on social media: \"Knowing when stages come to an end.",
      "\"Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal.",
      "\"Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "United will look to strengthen their midfield this summer - with Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson among their intended targets.",

      "Casemiro is set to leave Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The Brazilian's departure in four months' time is one way in which the club are seeking to remodel their squad, and getting the wages of a star player off the books will help them do that. Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid in 2022 in a deal rising to as much as £70m, scoring 21 times in his 146 games so far from the base of United's midfield.",
      "After helping the squad to a League Cup and FA Cup win, there had been calls to sell the ageing midfielder, but this season has shown that he is still more than capable of being a key man, most recently at the derby win over Manchester City. Posting on his Instagram account, Casemiro said: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "Some fans were quick to give Casemiro his flowers for his stint at the club. Reader Heehee123 says: \"Scored 21 goals and a quite a few of those were very important. Can hold his head high, at least he was one player who always gave his all.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Commenter Antw writes: \"People underestimate how good Casemiro actually is. He’s had a few off games, but when we played Lyon at Old Trafford & miraculously won, Casemiro had a part to play in all of the last 3 goals. He won the penalty, he set up Mainoo & also set up Maguire. Unfortunately his legs are giving up.\"",
      "Chrisssssss says: \"Yeah sad to see him go, but realistically seems like a sensible decision. Always more humble than I imagined.\"",
      "Phillotommo writes: \"Sad to See him go. But the legs have gone. Some great memories, and the passion he has for United is infectious. Pity his teammates haven't got the same work ethic as him. Best of Luck Cas, C'MON UNITED.\"",
      "For others, thoughts are already turning to what comes next for United's midfield. 1968red says: \"Well at least it will free up a few quid for a replacement, but it's been money well spent since we signed him. Wish him all the best and thanks for the memories Cas.\"",
      "Rightwing7 wants to see a similar character come in through the door: \"One of the best, if not the best DM in football history. Unfortunately for us, we got only 30% of the best Casemiro, but he give us 100% of what was left in his tank. Never complaining, 100% professional. Wish we can get a young 'Case', like the one when he was in his prime. All my respect for a fantastic football player, and I wish him well in future.\"",
      "Some would even like to see him remain at United in a different capacity. On our Facebook page, Ng Yoon Fatt says: \"This guy is a fantastic professional. He could be an inspiration to our kids in the academy. Personally, I would want to keep him, of course at the right price.\"",
      "Peter Bowker agrees: \"He should be put on the coaching staff in the academy. He is like Cantona, he commands respect. Been a great football player.\"",

      "Manchester United are yet to make a decision on whether Tyrell Malacia will be allowed to leave Old Trafford this month, with clubs in Europe interested in signing the left-back.",
      "Malacia was placed in the 'bomb squad' in the summer and made available for transfer, only to remain at the club for the first half of the season with no deal struck.",
      "The 26-year-old was reintegrated into the first-team squad in October and has made the bench for 13 of the last 15 games in all competitions, but he has been used only once when coming on as an 88th-minute substitute against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "It's been a frustrating year for the Netherlands international, who joined PSV Eindhoven on loan for the second half of last season but returned to his parent club after making 12 appearances, with just six starts.",
      "There has been interest in Malacia from clubs in Italy, Spain and Turkey this month, but it is understood there is no move imminent. The former Feyenoord defender has just five months remaining on his United contract and will be released at the end of the season if a deal isn't done this month, although he is keen to get more games under his belt.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He was the only one of five players placed in Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad' who didn't end up leaving Old Trafford in the summer. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford all secured moves away, either permanently or on loan.",
      "Malacia played 45 minutes for United's Under-21s against Wolves earlier this month, scoring in a 4-1 win. He has proven his fitness since missing 517 days with two serious knee injuries.",
      "He made his comeback in an EFL Trophy game against Huddersfield in November 2024 and went on to make eight further appearances for United before his move to PSV last January.",
      "Malacia's place in the matchday squad could be in jeopardy, with Noussair Mazraoui set to return from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Morocco before Sunday's trip to Arsenal. Mazraoui offers full-back cover on the left and right, while Luke Shaw is the first-choice at left-back in Michael Carrick's back four.",
      "Patrick Dorgu can also play at left-back, although he played on the wing in the win against Manchester City last weekend. United also have the highly rated 18-year-old Diego Leon in their ranks.",

      "The summer transfer mission for Manchester United is clear: it's time to sign a midfielder.",
      "The club have been putting off their next big investment in the central ranks for some time now, having put their focus into improving other areas such as the backline and the attacking options.",
      "Now, it's time for the centre of the park. While that seemed likely to be the focus of the recruitment team anyway, that need has been accelerated due to Casemiro's situation.",
      "Man United have confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club this summer at the end of his contract, with the decision made not to trigger the extra year that is included as a clause in his deal.",
      "The Brazilian was one of the last major investments in the midfield, with around £60m spent on securing him from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "While there have been some highlights, it seems United are keen to move on and look at the future beyond the 33-year-old, which puts greater emphasis on their deals in the summer.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at a few potential replacements for Casemiro in the transfer market, and what they could offer the team in the years ahead.",
      "Adam Wharton has already proved he has the skills and qualities to slot into any Premier League squad at present. However, given he is currently wanted by the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool and Spurs, United will face stiff competition in securing his services this summer.",
      "A fee north of £65m could also await any interested parties, given the 21-year-old is already Premier League proven.",
      "While Wharton is thought to be United's main interest at present, it is thought that Elliot Anderson is also being monitored. The 23-year-old has been a shining light in a struggling Nottingham Forest squad this season, but a deal will not come cheap.",
      "That's because the Tricky Trees have reportedly slapped Anderson with a price tag of around £100m.",
      "United pursued Carlos Baleba for the majority of the summer, only to be put off by Brighton's £100m valuation of the 22-year-old. An interest still remains in the midfielder and it will be interesting to see if the Seagulls' stance on letting him leave the south coast changes this summer.",
      "Joao Gomes has excelled with Wolves despite the club staring directly down the barrel of imminent relegation. The MEN reported earlier this week that a loan with an obligation to buy for the 24-year-old would be a most likely move. Wolves reportedly want £40m to let him leave midway through 2025/26.",
      "Like Baleba, United found themselves linked with Real Madrid's Eduardo Camavinga in the summer. The 23-year-old has been a revelation at the Bernabeu, with Arsenal and Liverpool said to be monitoring him. It was reported last month that Los Blancos will listen to offers around the £87m mark."

      "“Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey.”",
      "Cruz joined United in 2007 and as well as scouting first-team players in Portugal and Spain, he would offer valuable insight into Portuguese opponents ahead of European fixtures.

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",

      "Casemiro has been colossal in the Europa League knockout ties(Image: )",
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "Casemiro had a day to forget against Liverpool(Image: )",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "Casemiro was advised to retire by Jamie Carragher after the Palace thumping(Image: 2024 Getty Images)",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "Casemiro has scored a number of big goals for United(Image: )",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro celebrates his goal in Bilbao(Image: )",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

Replacing him might be harder than replacing the manager.",

      "United, having relatively comfortably just beaten City and Arsenal (at the Emirates no less) back-to-back, should see their next 6 games before playing anyone near them in the league as 3 points in the bag, easy, they then take on a Villa at home who I was reliably informed they should have beaten at Villa Park, another 3 points for Carrick’s men I’m sure, with only really banana-skins at Chelsea and hosting Liverpool to stand in their way of a perfect back-9 – both eminently winnable games themselves given they’ve, y’know, beaten them both already this season.",
      "Honestly, United could win their remaining 15 fixtures if you think about it – that is not only a literal possibility – it’s enough to win them the title. They only play 15 more games – no FA Cup 4th round, no draining League Cup 2nd Legs or Finals, no last-16 or quarters and beyond of a European trophy… just 15 winnable games over 17 weeks.",

Even in games we comfortably saw out in the end, we’re always ropey straight after scoring; where our best form teams of the previous seasons could quickly double up with another (even against Villa earlier this year) there seems to be a real complacency/level drop that is plaguing us.",

Hopefully I can copy paste all of these snippets into one epic email about how Arsenal won’t win the league if they do and everyone will acknowledge that being kneejerk in football is silly (who am I kidding). We weren’t good, United scored 2 amazing goals. We didn’t deserve to win, there’s a lot more football to play, calm down folks. A few things I wanted to chat about though.",
      "First, the narrative of United beating City and United. United were the better team, great tactics, outplayed and our harassed City. No mention of Haaland being terrible, just “stymied”. No discussions or commentary on City bottling the title/giving Arsenal the title on a platter. No lack of mentality. Nada. Just well done United.",

      "In both of these games I came to the same conclusion. This United team on paper is good, let them play what they are good at, quick 1 touch transitions and triangles, and they are a Champions League team. If you are a rigid structured control based team, this chaos is your kryptonite. I don’t understand how one team losing in one way a week ago can have such drastically different narratives today. Wild.",
      "Secondly, the fallacy that Arsenal can’t beat big teams is genuinely ridiculous at this point. Arteta’s points per game against the big 6 in the last 3 seasons: 1.9 (22/23), 2.11 (23/24) and 2 (24/25). In the last 2 season they have beaten:",
      "Real Madrid x2 (in a Champions League Quarter final, 2 wonder goals though)\nBayern Munich (“Best team in Europe” at the time, beaten comfortably)\nPSG (top of Ligue 1 at the time)\nCity (5-0)\nAtletico (comfortably)\nInter Milan (Top of Serie A at the time)",

      "…Not that I really want to defend Arsenal’s performance, but was it really that bad? I didn’t think so.",
      "Yes there was a lot of sterile possession but they moved the ball pretty well, and found it hard to break down Man Utd’s defence which, it should be said, had a very good day overall.",
      "As a Man Utd fan, I’m not really sure I remember Man Utd creating that many clear chances from open play either and nor would I have expected them to do so against the league leaders at their home ground. The match I watched was a fairly tight game were both teams played some good football that was decided by two wonder goals, but if it had ended up 2-2 I don’t think it would have been a particularly unfair result.",
      "I get that Arsenal are top of the league, but I don’t get the impression that anyone really thinks they’d beat the Man Utd team of ’08 or the Invincibles team, so why this attitude that they should be walking over teams pulling their pants down and scoring 5 of the best against a team that is, while in recovery from shite management at the very least expensively assembled and full of the talent that implies?",
      "That Carrick in 2 games has got us looking like a competent team that resembles the riches it cost to assemble them is more an indication of how much they were underperforming under Amorim and, as Ian Watson points out, playing players in their positions and in a system designed around their qualities rather than trying to force them into your system is not even GSCE level geometry let alone rocket science.",
      "I watched the game with my Arsenal supporting friend and I told him before the game I expected to lose but so long as we play ok and don’t just concede a sloppy goal or lose because players weren’t trying. If we lost because of a wonder goal, like the goal Henry scored against us that was the winner in 2000 then sometimes you just have to say “fair enough” and applaud the quality.",
      "And even if Dorgu never scores another goal that good, it was a great finish. Same with Cunha’s goal. Sometimes, there doesn’t need to be an inquest or an indictment of the coach, sometimes you have to just applaud the football, because that’s why we’re all here right? We don’t only watch and play because we want to win every week but because football is fun and exciting, because we appreciate the skill and the ability required, and we can wish that we had been able to score goals like that in the playground.\nDaniel (no to blind faith in Carrick, yes to a proper recruitment process) Cambridge",
      "",
      "…Nice to see the very measured reaction from the mailbox after another game where Arsenal dropped points. Let’s all calm down please. They are still 4 points ahead.",
      "United needed 2 worldies to win this game. Dorgu will never score a better goal in his career (now watch him score a rabona from the halfway line after beating 6 players next week) and Cunha can probably only do that once in 20 attempts.",
      "I’m a Chelsea fan and trust me, there are few things I want more than for Arsenal to bottle this league title. Unfortunately, I don’t think they won’t. Not because they’re this amazing team, but because I don’t think there’s any team that can catch them.",
      "Aston Villa are blowing super hot this season and the regression monster will catch up with them soon enough. You can’t keep depending on goals from outside the box and all your players finishing better than Lionel Messi for an entire season. Injuries, especially in midfield, will also play their part eventually. They’ll definitely finish in the top 4 though. The gap between them and the rest is quite big when you consider all the congestion in the league table.",
      "City have the best chance but I don’t think they’ll catch Arsenal either. This City team is just not good enough and the league is too strong for them to string their customary 10 straight wins.",
      "I really hope I’m wrong and one of those teams eventually overtake them. That will be the bottling to top all bottlings in history. I’m not holding my breath though.\nAbdulazeez (looks like Linkedin Liam is really a fine ager of men. Listening to his linkedinspeak is a price I’m willing to pay if he can make us good again. Gary O’Neil is doing fine with Strasbourg too. Win-win for all parties involved), Bristol",
      "",
      "As an Arsenal fan, watching the game at the Emirates was tough and the team deserves all the criticism it gets losing to Man U. It’s games like this, that cement my feeling that I don’t believe we will win the league.",
      "But one factor that is hardly being mentioned is that this was Arsenal’s 3rd game in the last 7 days whereas it was Man U’s first (they last played on 17th Jan).The Arsenal players were clearly knackered.",
      "Hopefully Arteta plays the U-21s (and Norgaard) in midweek and this can reset the main players in the team mentally and physically.",
      "Also we should have signed Semenyo to stimulate the attack, I’d been saying this to anyone who’d listen but obviously Arteta didn’t get the message!",
      "Hoping these last few results are the kick up the ass, the team needs to get out of this funk.\nIzzy",
      "",
      "I’ve already read multiple pieces explaining how Arsenal undid themselves after taking the lead against United. That their integrated ‘bottle job’ nature was to blame for the ensuing poor performance and whilst there is doubtless some truth to this it completely ignores the one really good thing Carrick did to manage the game.",
      "United had started very cautiously, staying compact and deep, no real press and very rigid positions. Though it’s understandable why Carrick setup this way it did allow Arsenal that precious field tilt that Arteta craves and United were completely hemmed in.",
      "Against City Carrick had used straight central passes from Martinez into Bruno to help break through but Arteta was ready for those. He had Saliba follow Bruno and get tight when he was set to receive the pass then dispossess him. It worked very well and Bruno was getting frustrated as the midfield was swamped making him completely ineffective.",
      "After Arsenal took the lead Carrick changed United’s tactic immediately, so quickly in fact that it must have been planned, ‘if we concede early we’re going to change to this so be ready’. Bruno and Mbeumo pressed the CBs high, Casemiro and Mainoo stepped up on their midfield, Dalot and Shaw started to jump on the wingers as soon as they received the ball. Caution was replaced with aggression and it unsettled Arsenal, forcing them to play under pressure and make passes across bigger spaces.",
      "United started to win the ball higher up the pitch which not only led to scoring chances but meant they could hold possession and bring the back line higher, robbing Arsenal of their territorial dominance. Having Maguire and Martinez that high was a risk given their relatively sedate pace, especially with Casemiro dropping in between them to create a back three, but Arsenal had virtually no threat behind so it never became an issue.",
      "Another well managed game from Carrick and another win against a historic rival. Same caveats as last week, let’s see where we are in 6-8 weeks before making any proper judgements.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick took 2 games to deliver back to back Premier League wins.",
      "Ruben Amorim took 11 months, and only did it once in his total 14 months in charge.",
      "Pretty Damning when you look at the level of opposition. The real test now is taking a minimum of 7 points from Fulham, Spurs and West Ham in the next 3.\nShane Tallon, Man Utd, Dublin",
      "READ: Man Utd and Carrick show succeeding Amorim to be simplest job in football",
      "",
      "…This morning’s mailbox had Dave (LFC – poor champions, but at least we are champions) write in stating “everyone else in the division can’t string two wins together.” Well Dave, I’d like to point out that Man Utd have, in fact, just strung two wins together!!",
      "In all seriousness, Fulham will be far harder as our tactic of sitting back won’t work there. Long road ahead, and if wenger introduced the 4th place trophy, I’m just hoping that maybe, against all odds, we might get some scissors/shears for a few of our fans. One can only dream…\nNiraj (Man Utd – okay but 4th or even 5th would have me over the moon) London",
      "",
      "I know everyone’s far more interested in laughing at Arsenal and Liverpool or celebrating the long awaited return of Man Utd, but I just have to quickly say how brilliant Villa were. Away at a ground we haven’t won at since Dyer and Bowyer inspired a young Jake Paul and shorn of McGinn and Kamara.",
      "Great team performance. Each and every player had an impact. Still, happy for the bulk of the chat to be about anyone and everyone but Villa.\nGary AVFC, Oxford (Not in the race for the top half)",
      "",
      "It might be churlish for me to even suggest to Man Utd than one (or even two) swallow(s) does not a summer make, but wins over City and Arsenal seem to have them hallucinating that the second coming is upon us.",
      "I for one look forward to more ‘routine’ games against opposition they can’t counter attack, and look forward to the continuing melt-down of their fanbase as the gift that keeps on giving (Yorkshire Man U fans, give me strength).",
      "I’m a York City fan but want Arsenal to win the league this year. Why? Because it’s not bloody Groundhog Day, and watching City or Liverpool (or even Chelsea) win most years makes football a bit too routine and kills me a little every time – will I ever see a team like Leicester win the league again? Is the closest we can get to that a team that finished 8th two years in a row and hasn’t won the league in my lifetime? I would be rooting for Villa, but I just can’t love a team that puts that much stock in Emi Martinez.",
      "So for the sake of variety, Arteta, drop Odegaard, play Merino up front and put Eze in there.\nBilly (York are going up ole ole!)",
      "",
      "…Maybe (definitely) it’s the bitter Gooner in me, but I am seriously over hearing how Carrick has transformed Man Utd in 2 games.",
      "Man Utd have been raising themselves for the big games for years (have people *Gary Neville* forgotten the FA Cup 3rd Round last season). Let’s see if he can get that lot up for a scrap against Burnley.",
      "Maybe start the talk about turning a corner then.\nKate",
      "",
      "Back in the mid 90s when I was at school, Leeds had signed an African by the name of Tony Yeboah. In 1995 he scored a number of brilliant goals, including an absolute beauty of a volley against (I think) Liverpool. At school the following week during lunch and later at PE, we all tried to recreate it with varying degrees of ineptitude (pretty sure I didn’t even hit the ball!). This was a continued theme during this period with us kids recreating solo goals and freekicks like they were Baddiel and Skinner doing phoenix from the flames.",
      "Do you know what we didn’t do during these kickabouts? Pass the ball around aimlessly trying to slow the game down and control it. Or some boring robotic passage of play that ends with a cutback and a tap in.",
      "Which was why I was glad to see Arteta getting called out for putting control over attack first. Or Rocastle7 commenting on the slight belittling of Man Utd winning a game of football with a couple of great outside the box goals. F365 were guilty of this during the Ole period, often downplaying a win because of some moment of individual brilliance from Bruno saying the club needed a coach like Pep who would coach patterns of play into the team. But, what was it that made us football fans? Slow, intricate passing triangles or a thunderbolt from a great player?",
      "So, stop worrying about XG, or control or patterns of play and lets go back to enjoying a playing having a go from 30 yards or a great player taking the game by the scruff of the neck to win the game.\nJohn Morgan (feeling old having just found out Tony Yeboah is 60 this year!)"

      "With Arsenal still four points clear at the top of the Premier League, sauntering through the Champions League with a 100% record and on course to reach the Carabao Cup final, we can’t stress enough the importance of clubs at home and abroad doing everything possible to deny them the quadruple. It doesn’t bear thinking about.",
      "With the January window still open, here are 10 transfers which could help thwart the Gunners on their seemingly inexorable path to glory.",
      "",
      "“We are not contenders to be in the top five,” Emery said after defeat to Everton, before falling awkwardly silent when asked why he feels his side cannot compete with the Premier League’s top clubs. He knows that everyone else knows it comes down to a lack of investment in his team, with Aston Villa’s net spend near zero since he arrived at the club in October 2022.",
      "Neither Tammy Abraham nor Jean-Philippe Mateta are going to move the contender dial to any great degree, but Ramos, who’s scored his 43 goals at a rate of one every 112 minutes for Paris Saint-Germain, could make a tangible difference.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola insisting he has “a thousand other priorities” ahead of long throws before signing arguably the face of the Premier League-wide campaign to bring it back into fashion would be lovely.",
      "We suspect Guardiola’s interest is more based upon Kayode’s almost unrivalled ability to dribble past opponents from right-back, along with his aerial ability and his addition would bring about the end of the Matheus Nunes experiment, which has gone on for far too long.",
      "But we’re not sure we would enjoy anything more than some pinball in the Arsenal box following a Kayode throw-in leading to a City victory, either in the Premier League in April, or should they meet in the knockout competitions.",
      "",
      "A penny for Xabi Alonso’s thoughts should Real Madrid sign Vitinha after he begged Florentino Perez for a midfield conductor, was denied, then sacked and would be forced to watch the presentation ceremony of the very best midfield conductor in world football rock up at the Bernabeu a couple of weeks later.",
      "We’re essentially suggesting here that Real Madrid have a better chance of winning the Champions League with Vitinha than PSG do, and do indeed sign up to that view given both Los Blancos’ astonishing ability to pull performances out of their proverbials when the tournament really kicks into gear and through what we reckon would be a monumental improvement in their team with the Portuguese star at the base of their midfield.",
      "",
      "The Saudi Pro League side are far more likely to give Arsenal’s coffers a tidy boost in the summer, but we could really do with them sticking a ludicrous figure on the table for Martinelli in January, which Andrea Berta and the Arsenal board believe is too good to turn down, preferably right at the very end, by which stage there’s no time to source a replacement for a guy who’s scored five goals in 305 Champions League minutes this season.",
      "",
      "This isn’t so much about how Alvarez would improve PSG as they’re already pretty well stocked up front and we strongly suspect the loss of Vitinha to Real Madrid will result in a typical and greatly missed implosion for the Ligue 1 giants which will see them dumped out of the Champions League in the not-too-distant future.",
      "What we absolutely cannot have is Arsenal signing someone to replace Viktor Gyokeres, who – bless him – is doing his level best to ensure the Gunners puzzle remains unfinished by being as dog-eared a final piece as possible.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick made very clear the importance of taking advantage of the increased energy that comes with the arrival of a new manager as part of his Old Trafford revolution. The added motivation bore juicy fruit in the Manchester derby and they carried that momentum to the Emirates. What a bizarre feeling it was for Manchester United to be the lesser of two evils as neutrals across the country celebrated that Matheus Cunha stunner.",
      "A new player bounce to add to the leap courtesy of Carrick wouldn’t go amiss, even if Manchester United are indeed now firmly in the Premier League title race after *checks notes* two wins in two games without spending £100m on Anderson, who presumably no longer prefers a move to Manchester City as DNA will make short shrift of the eight-point gap between the two clubs.",
      "",
      "There are more than a few Chelsea-supporting Robert Sanchez apologists these days, and there has indeed been a significant improvement in his performances this season. But Liam Rosenior toying with the idea of second goalkeeper of 427 on the Chelsea books, Mr Jorgensen, isn’t the greatest of fillips for the Spaniard, nor are the rumours of the Blues reigniting their interest in Maignan, who is said to have reached a verbal but not written agreement with AC Milan over an extension.",
      "What we cannot allow is for Chelsea to gift Arsenal goals in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final as Sanchez did on two occasions in the first meeting.",
      "",
      "Yan Diomande? The 19-year-old, right-footed, 1.8m Ivorian, born in Abidjan, who moved to the US in 2022 and had an unsuccessful trial at Rangers in October 2023? Know him? Sounds like it doesn’t it.",
      "Bayern are keen along with most Premier League giants so he must be pretty good. Doesn’t feel like they particularly need him given Luis Diaz’s 25 goal contributions from the left, but any means of increasing the squad depth arguably Arsenal’s greatest Champions League challengers is a positive, and also means Arsenal themselves – who have been linked – can’t have him.",
      "",
      "Wigan have reportedly had a third bid – thought to be in excess of one hundred thousand of your British pounds – rejected by Accrington Stanley for defender Benn Ward, whom Gyokeres would get precisely zero change out of should he sign before the Latics head to the Emirates in the FA Cup fourth round next month, as  such venerable strikers as Notts County’s Matthew Denis, Harrogate Town’s Tom Cursons and Colchester’s Samson Tovide can attest.",
      "",
      "Arsenal’s reward for finishing first in the Champions League table stands to be a two-legged last-16 tie against one of four teams: Galatasaray (17th), Qarabag (18th), Juventus (15th) or Borussia Dortmund (16th).",
      "We’re manifesting a meeting with Dortmund as – crushingly embarrassing defeat to Thomas Frank’s Tottenham aside – they’re probably our best bet of knocking Arsenal out; they’ve got good recent history in the competition and are currently second in the Bundesliga.",
      "They’ve been linked with Bobb and the 22-year-old feels like a prime candidate for being a hugely talented footballer who doesn’t quite make it at Manchester City, moves elsewhere and becomes a £100m star within two seasons.",
      "We have moved Bruno Fernandes into position behind Erling Haaland as Bruno Guimaraes comes into central midfield.",
      "If, like Roy Keane, you believe Michael Carrick isn’t a long-term manager for Manchester United, then you’ve got to say who is and somehow prove it.",
      "Chelsea fans have witnessed some truly baffling decisions being made at their club in the three-and-half years of BlueCo rule. They won’t stand for Palmer leaving for Man Utd.",
      "Arne Slot, Oliver Glasner and Thomas Frank will surely all be out of work soon, while Manchester United and West Ham being sensible does not feel right.",
      "With Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League now a useless four points, it is clear It Is Happening Again. But what even is a Bottle Job?",
      "Eddie Howe told Newcastle that they ‘can’t rely on one player’ as their miserable form without Bruno Guimaraes continued. But Sunderland should listen too."

      "If, like Roy Keane, you believe Michael Carrick isn’t a long-term manager for Manchester United, then you’ve got to say who is and somehow prove it. He can’t. You can’t.",
      "Any facts or stats offered as proof are all irrelevant. It’s all been tried before and not worked. The only route they’ve not gone down is to appoint a high-achieving lower-league manager. They probably think too much of themselves to do that, even despite their litany of failures, though there’s nothing to suggest it would be a worse decision than any of the others, so perhaps Andy Woodman at Bromley, top of League Two, is the answer?",
      "It might sound mad but appointing proven multiple title winners didn’t work, did it? Appointing a rising star didn’t either, nor did appointing someone who had been an FA Cup runner-up in 2008/09. People who have won things, people who haven’t; they’ve all been tried in the last 13 years.",
      "The result against Arsenal (read 16 Conclusions here) is no indication of anything really, especially against such a somehow feeble division-leading side, beyond investing badly needed self-belief. Maybe that’s all they need? Roy says they need ‘a bigger, better manager’ but they’ve had plenty of them before. How’s that worked out?",
      "It’s virtually impossible to argue for or against any manager, Carrick or anyone else, because all the precedents have been exhausted. Talking sensibly about it isn’t possible. History mocks you at every turn. There is no logic to be obeyed, no sense to be applied. Guesswork will be dressed up as some sort of pretentious executive problem-solving but that will be the sort of bullsh*t middle-management rubbish adopted to pretend it isn’t just a guess.",
      "So how do they go about deciding? It can’t just be the results. It can’t even just be how the team plays, though both must be in the equation. They need someone who will represent the club well, not be a dogmatic nutter, be able to inspire players and fans and just look like they know what they’re doing. It’s all very nebulous and based on gut feeling as much as facts and stats. Michael has a nice beard; that may be enough. Being a serial winner across Europe wasn’t, so why not judge them by the quality of facial hair?",
      "At no point in the past 13 years has anybody who makes decisions at Old Trafford done anything at all that might suggest that they have the first clue about what to do. The current incumbents may be the most stupid yet, with a series of shudderingly crass decisions.",
      "“He knows the club” has always been one of those football cliches spouted by mind-in-neutral pundits, along with the senseless concept of being a ‘natural’ goalscorer, like it’s somehow innate to some human beings to be able to kick a ball between two sticks.",
      "But a man that fully comprehends the situation he is in – both literally and metaphysically – is probably a greater indicator than anything connected with tactics. Someone they’re all just comfortable with would likely be a relief after previous purveyors of rigid dogmas. Above all, they have to be able to ignore the slurry of bad advice from the owners and their lackeys because they are serial failures that embarrass themselves at every turn in return for a lot of money.",
      "The one advantage they have is that no-one expects anything of them. Having been average to poor for so long, there’s no pressure. And with no European or cup football to play, they have a great advantage over those who do. So in that sense Carrick has a great chance. That said, he could be undermined by Jim Ratcliffe’s unerring ability to make the wrong decision.",
      "But if things continue in the current vein, what arguments could you make against Carrick’s appointment? You can’t recommend anything that hasn’t already been proven not to work. Against Arsenal, they looked much more like the team that was hated so much 20 years ago. It was like seeing someone wake up from a coma.",
      "While there is easy criticism for appointing Carrick, there’s easy criticism of anyone you care to name. There’s no guarantee it’ll work and no proof it won’t. In Carrick’s favour, he’s got six points from six against the top two teams. Yes, he’ll need to prove himself against bottom-third teams, but they don’t need to be in a hurry about this. June will be early enough to decide.",
      "The remainder of the season will be their best illustration of Carrick’s talent or otherwise and they won’t get such a comprehensive trial period with anyone else, but if he continues to be successful, what would the point be in changing?",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s name is used as a warning for nostalgia appointments. But if he ‘fails’ as well as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who finished third and second in his two full seasons, while reaching semi-finals and one final, surely that would be a success, considering the depths to which they have sunk. It would be both deluded and entitled to think anything else.",

      "Chelsea fans have witnessed some truly baffling decisions being made at their club in the three-and-half years of BlueCo rule. They won’t stand for Cole Palmer leaving for Manchester United.",
      "From signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to sacking Thomas Tuchel via re-hiring Frank Lampard and spending over £1bn on players and still not having a squad to mount a title challenge, the rap sheet is long and damning.",
      "The most recent contentious call saw them sack their fourth permanent manager Enzo Maresca, shortly after he led them to two major-ish trophies in a debut season in which he also secured Champions League football, and replace him with a coach of even less renown in Liam Rosenior.",
      "He’s off to a good start. Four wins from five, 10 goals, two clean sheets – not bad at all.",
      "And although we’re as tempted as anyone to mock a manager who claps far too loudly for comfort, is presumably now combing LinkedIn for pearls of motivational wisdom and is the last person you would want to find in the kitchen at a party, we wouldn’t be sticking to our woke lefty agenda if we didn’t hope for the success of a young, black British manager.",
      "But we doubt his appointment had anything to do with affirmative action. Like the vast majority of the decisions made by Todd Boehly/Behdad Eghbali/José E. Feliciano/Mark Walter/Hansjörg Wyss/Jonathan Goldstein/Barbara Charone/Lord Daniel Finkelstein/Paul Winstanley/Laurence Stewart/Joe Shields/Sam Jewell [delete as appropriate] it’s one that appears to have been made with a view to naysayers eventually hailing them as nonconformist geniuses.",
      "Keep academy graduates as they’re the soul of the football club? Nah, sell them for pure profit and use that money to sign other players and flip them for more profit, or indeed – more typically – for a loss.",

      "You could almost feel co-sporting directors Winstanley and Stewart reach near climax when, as Reece James lifted the Club World Cup, critics of their atypical process began to question whether the obsession with signing young players on absurdly long contracts might actually work.",
      "The sh*t-eating we-told-you-so grins on their faces should Rosenior lead Chelsea to genuine, incontestable success after managerial stints at Hull City and Strasbourg makes us almost hope he doesn’t.",
      "Reports suggest Palmer is ‘open’ to a move to Manchester United and ‘welcomes interest’ from the Red Devils because he’s ‘homesick’, but the timing of these rumours raises suspicion, arriving so soon after the change of manager.",
      "Liam Rosenior has had “numerous conversations” with Palmer, which may indeed have been positive as the Blues boss suggests, but the England international wouldn’t be human if at least a part of him didn’t question how on earth the man looking to ease his mind over his future got this job over the world-class managers Chelsea used to attract and insist upon.",
      "He’s played under Mauricio Pochettino, Maresca and now Rosenior at Stamford Bridge. That downward trend means it’s reasonable for him to question which Jupiler Pro League manager will be in charge next year.",
      "If you were to ask Palmer if he would rather have Rosenior in charge or Xabi Alonso, Xavi or other available managers there’s only going to be one answer. He might turn out to be wrong – Rosenior may end up doing a better job than any alternative – but the problem Chelsea have in the short term is in convincing Palmer to stick around long enough to find out whether that’s the case. Rosenior simply doesn’t have the back-catalogue to prove it’s worth trusting in his process.",
      "And although a move to Manchester United may therefore seem like an odd choice as they’re set on an inexorable DNA-enforced path to Michael Carrick’s permanent appointment at the end of the season, Palmer can feel safe in the knowledge that if that doesn’t work then United will look to hire the manager they believe to be the best in class, as was the case with Ruben Amorim, poor decision though that turned out to be,",
      "Chelsea fans would begrudgingly accept Palmer moving to Real Madrid. They’re a bigger fish. But Chelsea have won two Premier Leagues and two Champions Leagues since Manchester United won either of those trophies. They’ve been the laughing stock to put Chelsea’s recent struggles into perspective.",
      "Palmer – despite an injury-hit season – remains the main reason to be cheerful as a Chelsea fan. While he remains so too does the hope of one of the big trophies in the not-too-distant future, false though that hope may be while one of the biggest clubs in the world continues to put their trust in managers without the experience to merit their position.",

      "The Blues have missed Palmer for a large chunk of the season through injury with the England international playing just 13 times in all competitions.",
      "But he’s been the standout player in the BlueCo era at Stamford Bridge since joining from Manchester City for a bargain £42m in the summer of 2023, contributing 41 goals and 19 assists in 82 Premier League appearances.",
      "A report on Thursday insisted that Palmer has become ‘unsettled’ at Chelsea and that he’d consider re-joining Man City if Pep Guardiola leaves in the summer as he’s become ‘homesick’.",
      "There have also been rumours that Manchester United, who he supports, could be an option with Chelsea legend Marcel Desailly fearing he may hand in a “transfer request” if the Blues don’t qualify for the Champions League.",
      "And now, despite transfer expert Graeme Bailey earlier on Monday that Palmer remains “fully committed to Chelsea”, a report from The Sun now insists Palmer ‘would be open to a sensational transfer to Manchester United’.",
      "The report adds:",

      "Bailey had earlier told our friends at TEAMtalk that although Palmer would like to move closer to the North West in the future, he is ‘settled’ at Chelsea.",
      "Bailey explained: “We understand from figures close to the player that while Palmer would ideally like to be based closer to the North West in the long term, given that he is a long-time United fan and has harboured ambitions of playing for them, but he is not pushing to leave Stamford Bridge and remains fully committed to the project under BlueCo.",
      "“Indeed, those close to the Wythenshawe‑born star describe him as ‘settled, valued and focused’ as he continues to shine in blue.",
      "“Inside Chelsea, the feeling is mutual. The club view Palmer as a core pillar of their rebuild and one of the standout success stories of their recruitment strategy. Senior figures are adamant that he is central to their plans and not a player they would entertain losing lightly.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed last week that nothing will happen with a potential transfer in January with Chelsea seeing Palmer as “crucial” to their plans.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “We had rumours in England about Cole Palmer’s desire to go back to Manchester, maybe to Man Utd, Palmer to leave Chelsea in the summer. In January, nothing is happening. At this stage, Chelsea’s position is very clear.",
      "“They see Palmer as a crucial part of their project. Chelsea don’t want Palmer to leave the club. Today, Liam Rosenior in his press conference said he’s a crucial part of our long-term project. He said, ‘I had several conversations with Cole and he’s very happy here.’",
      "“Chelsea are not on alert for anything at this stage. Obviously, there will be always rumours around Palmer, a fantastic player.",
      "“But as of today, January, nothing is happening and Chelsea are counting on Palmer at this stage.”",
      "Chelsea fans have witnessed some truly baffling decisions being made at their club in the three-and-half years of BlueCo rule. They won’t stand for Palmer leaving for Man Utd.",
      "Chelsea attacker Cole Palmer “would ideally like to be based closer to the North West” but he’s committed to the Blues in the short term.",
      "According to reports, Cole Palmer ‘wants to leave’ Chelsea and Manchester United, who have made him their ‘top target’, are readying a huge offer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed a “very clear” update on Cole Palmer’s future at Chelsea, who could be “happy to proceed” with another transfer.",
      "Liam Rosenior dismisses Cole Palmer homesick claims, confirms Chelsea star is “very, very happy” and has provided injury and transfer updates.",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson insists that Cole Palmer will be sold by Chelsea if another club puts in a bid of £120m or more in the summer."

      "Roy Keane in particular has urged caution in bestowing too much praise upon Carrick – this could of course be little more than a ‘new manager bounce’ – but even he can’t deny the mood has shifted dramatically.",
      "And Shearer wonders what Amorim – who was sacked earlier this month after a breakdown in the relationship with the club bosses – must be making of the turnaround.",
      "One of the key changes Carrick has made is a move to a 4-2-3-1 formation after Amorim ploughed on with his 3-4-3 system, refusing to alter it despite the shocking results and performances.",
      "“What on earth is Ruben Amorim sat doing, thinking, looking at those two performances? I mean honestly, I don’t know what he’ll be thinking,” Shearer said on The Rest Is Football.",

      "The Red Devils view Wharton as a key piece in their ongoing midfield rebuild, with sources close to the club indicating that informal approaches have already been made to gauge the player’s availability.",
      "We first revealed way back in October 2024 that United are huge admirers of the Palace midfielder, and he remains top of the club’s shortlist alongside the likes of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "Despite United’s strong push for Wharton, competition remains fierce. Manchester City, Liverpool, and Newcastle United have all registered their interest, holding preliminary discussions with Wharton’s representatives.",
      "Liverpool, in particular, are understood to be aggressive suitors, with sources suggesting they have held fresh talks and that Wharton himself is open to a move to Merseyside. Some outlets even claim the Reds are frontrunners, potentially offering a long-term contract to secure his services.",
      "Newcastle’s involvement adds further intrigue, as Eddie Howe’s side seek to bolster their engine room amid ambitions to break into the top four consistently.",
      "Man City, meanwhile, see Wharton as a potential long-term successor in their possession-based system and they are the side that other clubs fear in the race. With this in mind, everything points towards a furious",

      "At Selhurst Park, expectations are that Wharton will depart Palace when the season concludes.",
      "As we revealed in an update on January 20, sources indicate the chances of Wharton staying at Palace beyond this season are “almost zero”, putting his suitors on even higher alert.",
      "The talented deep-lying playmaker, who has impressed since his £18million move from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024, has established himself as one of the Premier League’s most promising young midfielders.",
      "His composure on the ball, tactical intelligence, and ability to dictate tempo have drawn comparisons to top-class operators, have earned him three senior England caps and a place in Thomas Tuchel’s thinking ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "This graph from football analysts, Gradient Sports, tells a story.",
      "Palace are set to demand a substantial fee – figures in the £65-80million range have been floated – to part with their prized asset, though some sources suggest they could hold out for closer to £100million total package given the bidding war potential.",
      "For United, landing Wharton would represent a statement of intent under their current regime, addressing long-standing deficiencies in central areas. However, with multiple elite clubs circling, negotiations promise to be protracted and costly. Landing a Champions League spot would help them massively as we’re told that, ideally, Wharton wants UCL football.",
      "As the January window nears its end, attention turns to the summer, where Wharton’s next destination could reshape several Premier League midfields.",
      "Meanwhile, my colleague, Dean Jones, has reported that United are considering signing a new left-back after Patrick Dorgu has thrived in his new role in attack.",
      "Dorgu scored an incredible goal in United’s 3-2 victory away to Arsenal on Sunday – his second goal in as many games.",
      "This could change the plans at Old Trafford, with the addition of a new left-back now described as a ‘priority.’",
      "In other news, United have made an enquiry for Besiktas midfielder Wilfred Ndidi, our transfer insider, Graeme Bailey, has confirmed.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Manchester United) – £45m",
      "5th (Chelsea) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Liverpool) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Fulham) – £37.1m",

      "19th (Burnley) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",

      "Arsenal fans are fuming and nobody is entertained by what could be the worst Premier League champions ever.",
      "We also have thoughts on Man Utd and West Ham, but mostly Arsenal. Send your views to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Not a revolutionary take here, but Arteta seems to have prioritised control over a game over all facets. The concept of ball possession as a means of control isn’t new – especially seeing as Guardiola pioneered and then arguably perfected it – but I would argue that Arteta has pushed it farther than ever this season.",
      "We’re all familiar with ‘haram ball’, which refers to Arsenal’s stodgy and incredibly practical (and effective) approach to football – playing for corners and set pieces, prioritizing ball circulation, and restricting the opponent’s ability to create chances above all else.",
      "Even as an Arsenal supporter, it’s been hard to watch. The biggest effect this has on players is that it rewards passive and sterile play over risk-taking actions, like letting fly from outside the box or going long. You can also see this from the lack of creative spark and output that previously effective players like Saka, Odegaard, Eze or Martinelli have displayed (at least in the Prem).",
      "I won’t argue that many teams set up to play into this almost half-court set from kickoff, especially at the Emirates. But United were different. You could argue that there was an element of luck to their goals (two great shots from outside the box and a giveaway), but it’s the aggression and desire to play forward that impressed me. If Zubimendi wasn’t trying to keep the ball at all costs, would he have tried an ill advised backwards pass when he could’ve tried open up his body and hit a forward in behind?",
      "Arteta has somehow ingrained in this team that losing the ball is always a bad thing, even if you’re trying to be creative and attacking. The entire offense at this point consists if feeding it to a wide player, who then vaguely tries to get to the byline and win a corner, or more often cut back and circle again.",
      "It’s hard to be happy with this sort of play, even if the results have been largely positive. At this point, it makes me question whether Arteta teaches any sort of attacking philosophy, interchange, or pattern, which is a real disappointment given how exciting the 22/23 team was. Arteta has managed to mold this team to be exactly what he wants, good or bad, and while I don’t think he needs to win the Prem to keep his job, his shortcomings are becoming clearer and clearer.\nKenny",
      "",
      "…It’s clear now that Arteta’s emphasis on controlling games may have blunted our attack. Our central players (Ødegaard, Rice and Eze) aren’t making enough runs into the box. I want to see them driving into the box for square balls and one-twos, it’d be interesting to see how we’d play with Eze and Ødegaard on at the same time with Rice backing them up. Otherwise far too much reliance on wingplay, link-ups with fullbacks and crosses has made us quite predictable in open play.",
      "The trouble is the risk from counter-attacks when our central players advance into the box. Can Rice cover this risk along with the back line? This is the trade-off that we have to consider but with the quality of Rice, Saliba and Gabriel with the added depth in the squad we could withstand this issue.",
      "Also hindsight is 20/20 but imagine if we’d signed Mbeumo or Cunha instead…\nVish (AFC), Melbourne",
      "",
      "…We’re 23 games into the season, Arsenal are still top of the table, and yet I’m struggling to remember a single attacking move or goal that genuinely excited me.",
      "That probably sounds ungrateful given the league position, but watching us week after week, I don’t see how this attacking setup wins a title. Most of our goals come from corners, second balls, or scrappy finishes off wide crosses. There’s almost no creativity through the middle, no willingness to shoot from distance, no moments where you feel a defence is about to be unlocked by something clever or unexpected.",
      "What’s worrying is that I’ve felt more entertained – and more hopeful – watching Wenger-era Arsenal sides that finished fourth than I do watching this team supposedly challenging for the title. Back then, even when we fell short, there was identity, invention, and a sense that something special might happen at any moment.",
      "This version of Arsenal feels efficient, controlled and sterile. That might be enough to stay near the top, but unless something changes creatively, I can’t see it being enough to go all the way.\nMubashir Iqbal, Gooner from Pakistan",
      "",
      "…So much wrong for Arsenal against United but to anyone that watches us weekly knew a result like that was coming.",
      "Liverpool would have beaten us, if they just tried a little harder. We’ve been playing this atrocious brand of football most of the season and especially since the Spurs game. No creativity, no spark, players coached to within an inch of their lives as the manager is so afraid of losing, he’s created a monster that is reliant upon results and he’s had them, quite a few to be fair but nothing that really states, we are going to be champions.",
      "So when a defeat comes, it’s going to look pretty ropey as the attention falls on the tactics. And they are not even what George Graham instilled in the club, at least they had an aura whilst playing hoofball.",
      "Time and again chances have presented themselves to show that we have character and the mettle. We’ve failed every single one. And a fourth year of it should absolutely spell the end of it if it happens again, barring a miraculous Champions League trophy.",
      "We are still 4 points clear. We should absolutely change the approach to football, playing with pace, intent and actually utilise the players we have properly. Odegaard, Saka, Martinelli have regressed and that’s down to their roles being very flat and one dimensional. Play them in the way we know they can win you matches. It’s not like our defence is that great either right now, so you need to play and not suddenly let Saliba be the creative force. Let the forwards be creative and take some risks.",
      "Thing is you know, I know, the Emirates knows, everyone everywhere knows, he’ll look to protect that 4 point lead rather than stretch it. And that will be the downfall. A trophyless season, and even the most ardent of Arteta fans will fall and there is no coming back from that.",
      "Sink or swim, Mr Arteta. Stop being scared.\nAli, Ealing",
      "",
      "Tickner mentioned in 16 Conclusions that United relied on two wonderstrikes to win, something he noted was “not a particularly repeatable tactic”. Later though, he described Cunha’s goal as “calmly curled in from 25 yards like it was a tap in”. Should we give more credit to strikes from distance as a repetitively effective tool to win football matches?",
      "First, save me the boring bollocks statisticians who will point to xG and all that nonsense. Maybe it’s nostalgia talking, but I hate feeling like the shot from distance is dying in favor of the Pep inspired robo-goal (slide it down the inside channel for a cut back and tap in from 7 yards) or the corners bundled over the line looking like playground scuffles.",
      "As a fan, when I think of memorable premier league goals, Gabriel scoring a header from a Declan Rice corner isn’t up there. It’s Morten Gamst Pedersen. It’s Erik Edman. It’s that one MOTD goal of the month selection in Dec 2006 that was worldie after worldie (think Scholes volley vs Villa won it but any of them would win goal of the season in more recent years) Even as an Arsenal fan I think of Henry vs Utd, or Bergkamp curling one in the top corner from 25 yards out.",
      "I smiled when Dorgu had a pop yesterday. Fair play. Also, might be worth continuing. For instance, United have scored 9 of their 41 PL goals from outside the box this year. Arsenal have scored 6 from their 42. United have significantly fewer touches in the opposition box than Arsenal manage, but yet shoot more in general (258 to 226), and hit the target more frequently from distance than Arsenal in the PL this season (70 to 48). In fact, of the 70-odd goals Arsenal have scored in all comps this season, 10 have come from outside the area and that’s including Martinelli’s actual tap-in after rounding Neuer at the half way line in the Champions League.",
      "United can score from a variety of different areas, and don’t shy away from an effort from distance. Maybe Arsenal need to take some stock in that tactic. To think the two of them have scored an almost identical amount of PL goals despite having such drastically different seasons so far is madness.",
      "Anyway, this is all just a roundabout way of supporting shots from outside the box!\nRocastle7 (and what about chips?! Why is nobody dinking keepers no more…?)",
      "",
      "An own goal, a scrambled in corner with 9 players crowding and elbowing the keeper, and they still cannot win a game. This Arteta side has to be the worst team to ever be at the summit of the league, and if they go on to win, the worst champions I’ve seen in my 33 years of life.",
      "It’s a cruel, morbid and ugly level of football where neither the defense is exciting, nor the attack. It’s purely set pieces and pray. Read somewhere they rank 17th in chances created from open play. That is just abysmal. There are no tactics, no plan of attack, no class.",
      "Please Emery & Villa, win the league! I am sure all 19 league clubs including City will be open to loaning you some top players for the season if you can stop this nonsense team from winning the league this year. Please do it for football’s sake. This is like if Hitler won the World War or Voldemort beat Harry Potter. Just bleak and grey.",
      "PS: I told y’all in my earlier mails Amorim was pure trash, not even close to a real coach. And happy to be redeemed. Rubbish rubbish waste of time and resources. Carrick doing the bare basics right has got the team functioning like an actual team again & not a reflection of an egotistical scam artist.\nAman (Ballon D’orgu time)",
      "",
      "…The thing about Arsenal is they always try to walk it in The thing about Arsenal is they always play for corners and just pack the 6 yard box with players so the keeper can’t come out to claim the ball. That’s why a lot of people don’t like this iteration of Arsenal.",
      "They’ve spent close to a billion pounds on players just to pack the 6 yard box with 6 foot + monsters and try to glitch their way to a league title. Like that one fella who found a character in Street Fighter, with a move that can’t be stopped, and spams the same thing over and over. Sure he might have won but no one particularly liked them.",
      "We saw a prime example of it at the weekend with the Merino goal. Arsenal fans will grasp at straws and say the deliveries are excellent from Rice and Saka. No they’re not. Any professional footballer should be able to cross a ball like that when they know the keeper is essentially pinned to his line. It’s a legit tactic, and Arsenal may very well spam enough corners before the end of the season to get them over the line, but don’t be surprised when even Liverpool fans are cheering on Man Utd against you. We’ll all be there if it goes wrong.",
      "Wenger’s words at the weekend said it all. Even he’s not enjoying watching it.\nDavid, Ireland",
      "",
      "United have had two brilliant results since Carrick was installed as interim coach. However if i hear another ex United player talk about DNA or he knows the club I’ll scream.",
      "There are a few simple reasons which have contributed to United looking like an actual good side. Most are just things which Amorim was just too stubborn to change.",
      "1. Formation to 4-2-3-1.\n2. Fernandes playing as a No. 10\n3. Midfield looking better defensively.\n4. Two experienced centre-backs\n5. More effort and more running.",
      "There are obviously some tactical tweaks Carrick has made as well but please stop the DNA BS.\nKen, Cork, Ireland",
      "READ: Man Utd and Carrick show succeeding Amorim to be simplest job in football",
      "",
      "Very mixed feelings this weekend. Great performance and result against a poor Sunderland. Fernandes is now arguably our most important player (Jared must be relieved to have someone even close to how brilliant he has been for so long), and at 21 is bound to be a massive star sooner rather than later.",
      "Gut wrenching to read your (correct) article about the vultures already circling. The Paqueta situation is confusing and depressing. Though, for what it’s worth, it’s 3 wins out of 3 without him. Brentford not showing up at all against Forest today was excruciatingly infuriating.",
      "However, I’d rather we were where we are now, on a good run of form, with a couple of new players providing competition for places, than wondering where the next win is coming from (cough, Palace, cough). As grim as the table looks, this feels a bit like the 2003 season when 18th place went down with 42 points (yes, us, with Joey Cole, Carrick, Kanoute, Sinclair, Defoe and Di Canio. Sorry, just throwing up again for the thousandth time). I feel like there will be a team or two that unexpectedly get dragged into a relegation battle. Maybe that’s just wishful thinking, but you have to have hope eh…",
      "On that note, I’ve just looked at Spud’s February fixtures. Hmm…. And with that in mind, I was amused by Mr Tickner’s emotional defense of his Spud’s “Big Six” position in that made up group. Perhaps he doth protest too much??",
      "Wasn’t sure whether he was saying that the Deloitte money table proves that Spurs are massive (the fact that we are in the top 20 globally surely makes that a farcical irrelevance), or whether the fact that they are playing in an, admittedly, hugely watered down CL system, is some kind of evidence.",
      "I’m glad that Spuds fans are so comfortable with their 17th place last year and 15th place right now, and can look to their “Big Six” status to gain such confidence and comfort. Whilst still unlikely that they will actually go down of course, I’d love to read Dave’s article next season explaining at his usual massive length how huge and important his team is, whilst in the Champo. We live in hope eh!\nMike, COYI"

      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may yet follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "But a couple of wins have eased the pressure on Nuno – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and apparently even a grim point at Burnley is enough to save Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there.",
      "And it now looks like Arne Slot rather than Frank or Nuno will be the latest ‘winner’ here as Liverpool’s fraudulent unbeaten run finally came to an end at Bournemouth, who like West Ham, have been rejuvenated by Frank and Dr Tottenham.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 15 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",

      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "Despite a slightly sticky run including that ultimately heavy defeat at the Arsenal, Villa are still in there scrapping. An impressive victory at Newcastle coupled with Arsenal’s defeat to Man United has brought the gap back down to four points while keeping Villa well clear of any real risk of losing their grip on a Champions League place.",

      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",

      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",

Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",

      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",

      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa has Howe once again under fire.",

      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, for neither the first nor last time, Tottenham have come to the rescue. The momentum from last week’s vital win at Spurs has been parlayed into another over Sunderland to rekindle dwindling survival hopes for both club and manager.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford has given Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy.",

We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other Big Six team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down with Palace currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 11 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley appears to be enough to keep him in place for another week is damning. We assume we’ve all by now twigged that Spurs are obviously going to beat Man City at the weekend, so he really might be here for a good while yet, somehow.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth.",

      "Forest 0 Arsenal 0\nViking Tom Cleverley starts alongside his fellow Scandinavian performance art expert, Viking Clogger. Midfield creativity is zilch, both are subbed off – too little too late. 2 points dropped, naff all created, no goals scored (The 365 MAGA cohort conclude “Point gained”. Yes, just like when Trump supporters tell us that inflation rising is a sign of economic success!)",

Arsenal are nervous, create absolutely nada, sterile in possession and, you guessed it, cannot score one single goal. Bournemouth managed 3 at home to a Liverpool side with less injuries than the one El Fraudo faced. Nevertheless, the verdict from Islington MAGA? “1 point gained, Citeh and Villa dropped points”.

Again, Arsenal midfield lacks creativity, lethargic, soporific and dull. Arsenal to their credit finally manage a goal from open play (the opposition scored it naturally) Like Liverpool at home: the Fake Champions-elect are passive, cannot create and cannot score. This time, even Islington MAGA struggle to read out a beaming report of RECORD CROPS (because everyone can literally the barren vegetation outside their window). Their verdict? Errrrm. “The Oscars nominations disrupted the players!”",

They’ve had chance, after chance to wrap up this PL title – first at Forest when Citeh dropped points, then at home to a washed Slot Liverpool. I bet on ManYoo to win this match because Carrick showed against Citeh that he’s brave enough to attack and take risks – whereas, as I’ve eternally maintained, Arteta is a coward plain and simple.

      "So after all that, it turns out that managing Manchester United is actually a piece of piss.",
      "Okay, that may be a conclusion too flippant to make the 16 in the wake of the Red Devils’ impressive win at Arsenal on Sunday. But there is certainly a strong argument for Ruben Amorim being one the easiest-ever managers to follow in the Premier League era.",
      "With each passing game under Michael Carrick’s control, the folly of Amorim’s religious devotion to a system that suited almost no-one at Old Trafford becomes more stark.",
      "Carrick came in after Darren Fletcher acted as first responder and in just two games, United might not be ‘back’, but they certainly look a sight closer to what a United team ought to.",
      "What’s Carrick’s magic formula? Play players in positions and a formation that suit their individual and collective talents.",
      "It really is that simple. Sure, Carrick and his coaching staff will have found other ways to lift a woefully-underperforming squad – taking ketchup off the contraband list, that sort of thing – but to make the biggest difference, all they really had to do was get out of the players’ way.",
      "That is not to diminish Carrick’s achievements so far. Going unbeaten against City and Arsenal would have been a very creditable return. To spark United to be the first team in a decade and a half to win back-to-back games against the top two is quite remarkable.",
      "MORE: 16 Conclusions from Arsenal 2-3 Man Utd: DNA, bottle, retro kits, Carrick, Arteta, Mbeumo and more",
      "But, more than anything, it highlights just how much Amorim’s stubbornness was holding United back.",
      "From being a team whose shortcomings in the middle third set them up to fail at either end, the Red Devils suddenly appear defensively solid and threatening going forward. It was all so bleedin’ obvious.",
      "Amorim is hardly the first and only coach to make it all about himself. Fans and the wider public now insist upon a philosophy, a recognisable style – usually recognisable because almost every other team is trying to play the same way – and identifiable patterns of play. More than anything, Amorim sought to make United the embodiment of his principles, at the cost of, y’know, winning football matches.",
      "Carrick was hired to keep it simple. That’s all United needed in the Amorim aftermath.",
      "In a system more familiar to every single one of them, the players look free. Liberated from Amorim and their own minds, no longer second-guessing each instinct while making 3-5-2-1 appear a quadratic equation.",
      "Any team will always be the sum of its parts and the improved performances of individuals is just as damning on Amorim as the collective revival.",
      "The most obvious: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Amorim deemed the England international – it wasn’t that long ago –  incapable of playing in the base of his midfield because… reasons. Mainoo might not have always helped his own cause but the fact him and United came as close as they did to giving up on each other highlights the misplaced priorities during Amorim’s reign.",
      "We know Mainoo is technically good enough for the role. His ability to cover the ground was questioned but in two starts under Carrick, he ran further (11.89km against City and 11.26km at Arsenal) than any other player on either pitch.",
      "Mainoo’s presence means Bruno Fernandes can play higher. Putting the skipper, one of Europe’s most creative players, on a leash held by three centre-backs ought to have been a sackable offence in itself. That Fernandes made the best of it reflects far better on him than the departed manager.",
      "Giving Mainoo and Fernandes the platform each need to thrive were such easy and obvious wins, Carrick probably could have been forgiven for thinking it was a trap.",
      "Any manager needs luck and Carrick has benefited from the timing of his appointment. Mainoo was just out off the treatment table when he walked into the dressing room and doubtless the change of manager helped speed the healing process. Fernandes too was just back from injury, as was Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Paul Scholes might not fancy the World Cup winner much but it is clear to anyone without an agenda that United, in and out of possession, are a much better with Martinez as part of a duo – not a trio – at the heart of their defence.",
      "If Carrick’s luck holds, and United keep their key players fit through the remainder of his interim rein, on the evidence of his first two games, he could back the board into the kind of corner they haven’t easily wriggled out of in the past.",
      "United will be egged on to keep Carrick more with each win, the danger of doing so only matched by refusing to even consider the possibility that he could be a leading candidate come the end of the season.",
      "The prematurity of that debate makes it tiresome already, but February will offer a clearer picture of what United and Carrick might be capable of. In contrast to opening with the top two, four of their next five games are against bottom-half sides, the type of opponent that tripped up United almost as often as they stumbled over themselves under Amorim.",
      "We have moved Bruno Fernandes into position behind Erling Haaland as Bruno Guimaraes comes into central midfield.",
      "We can’t stress enough the importance of clubs at home and abroad doing everything possible to deny Arsenal the quadruple. These ten January transfers would help.",
      "If, like Roy Keane, you believe Michael Carrick isn’t a long-term manager for Manchester United, then you’ve got to say who is and somehow prove it.",
      "Chelsea fans have witnessed some truly baffling decisions being made at their club in the three-and-half years of BlueCo rule. They won’t stand for Palmer leaving for Man Utd.",
      "Arne Slot, Oliver Glasner and Thomas Frank will surely all be out of work soon, while Manchester United and West Ham being sensible does not feel right.",
      "With Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League now a useless four points, it is clear It Is Happening Again. But what even is a Bottle Job?"

      "4. As for Arsenal… are they really doing it again? Surely they’re not doing it again? It’s an impossibly harsh but unavoidably relevant question. Arsenal’s recent history means the scope for things to become painfully self-fulfilling at this point is unbelievably potent.",
      "It is patently ridiculous that a team losing a 24-0-0 all-competitions record when scoring first is damned for the loss of such a record rather than praised for its existence. But nobody will be making these points more forcefully than Arsenal fans themselves. Nobody will be more aware of what this might be than Arsenal fans themselves.",
      "There was a desperate, palpable nervousness about Arsenal today as they sought to respond to victories for Man City and Aston Villa earlier in the weekend.",
      "",
      "5. And while the point about the spectacular nature of United’s second and third goals applies just as much to not over-reacting to Arsenal’s defeat as it does to over-reacting to United’s victory, it’s not as if they were bolts from the blue. These were not rogue misfortunes that derailed an otherwise acceptable performance.",
      "Arsenal were nowhere near it, and weirdly got more nervous and less certain after what should have been a perfect nerve-settler of an opening goal.",
      "",
      "6. It had been an odd start to the game before it burst so dramatically to life. Arsenal were in total control, but it was an eerily sterile dominance. Arsenal had all of the ball and all of the territory but before getting their goal via a swing and a miss from Lisandro Martinez led to the ball cannoning in off his standing leg, they had created precious little.",
      "At one point in the first 15 minutes Arsenal had completed 22 passes in the final third to United’s zero. Yet Arsenal had nothing really to show for being in such utter control of proceedings. The goal would eventually come, but it never felt like it definitely would. Never had the sense of inevitability you’d expect.",
      "It never, in fact, felt as inevitable as United’s equaliser did almost from the moment Arsenal went ahead. As for Martinez, we can only say that perhaps that goal wouldn’t have happened if he’d just bothered to be slightly taller? Something to think about there.",
      "",
      "7. So soon after Arsenal’s opening goal did United’s first glimmer of a chance come that Peter Drury hadn’t even finished his prepared soliloquy before grudgingly accepting the need to mention with a sigh that Bryan Mbeumo was now to be found bearing down on goal.",
      "That chance came to nothing, but another miscommunication at the back soon after created another chance for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "This time it required an extraordinary recovery from William Saliba to prevent an equaliser. Having initially let the ball run past him, presumably unaware of the lurking danger, he then somehow stuck out a telescopic go-go-Gadget leg to get their first and scupper Bruno’s shot.",
      "",
      "8. But the reprieve was temporary. Arsenal’s third and most egregious error in five baffling minutes saw Martin Zubimendi, usually the most reliably safe pair of hands imaginable, make a horrible mess of a backpass after having a pass fizzed into him with unnecessary pace.",
      "Mbeumo still had plenty to do, and did it with what is becoming customary style as he shimmied round David Raya to score his 50th Premier League goal.",
      "He is already one of the signings of the season and is developing a happy knack for scoring premium goals.",
      "That’s now goals in victories at Anfield and the Emirates, as well as in a home win over Man City. It’s a fine return on investment in his first season, and he was sorely missed during that dispiriting run of draws around the new year when he was away on AFCON duty.",
      "",
      "9. It would have been easier to forgive Arsenal’s first-half sloppiness and nervousness had they been shaken out of these navel-gazing afflictions at the interval. But they weren’t.",
      "The second half began very much as the first ended, with United encouraged to believe there was far more here for them today than anyone might have anticipated.",
      "Of course there’s an air of freakishness to Patrick Dorgu scoring what Gary Neville called on commentary ‘a goal of a lifetime’ but these are the things that can happen when you offer opponents as much seemingly unnecessary encouragement as Arteta’s side has taken to doing.",
      "Having played a sort of double one-two with Fernandes, Dorgu arced his shot spectacularly beyond Raya even before we’d fully completed the thought that we hoped he didn’t do that because it would force us to try and describe the set-up and ‘double one-two’ feels entirely unsatisfactory.",
      "",
      "10. We do feel we have to take some responsibility for Arsenal’s shoddiness here. You can’t go around publishing Quadruple Content on the morning of a match without expecting egg to be instantly administered to faces.",
      "Of course, nothing is f*cked here today. Arsenal are still four points clear. They are still heavy favourites to win the league. They probably haven’t just commenced a bottlejob. But we must all accept they are slightly less compelling quadruple candidates this evening than they were this morning.",
      "But whatever happens over the weeks and months ahead, they will have one quadruple to look back on thanks to the mass Hail Mary substitution Arteta attempted just before the hour to try and rejuvenate what was by now a thoroughly moribund performance.",
      "Four substitutes, Mikel? Four? That’s insane.",
      "In fairness, the introductions of Mikel Merino, Eberechi Eze, Ben White and Viktor Gyokeres did energise Arsenal a bit.",
      "",
      "11. Or at least, they energised the crowd. There was a conspicuous cheer for the introduction of Gyokeres in particular. It might not have been a good day for Arsenal, but Gyokeres wouldn’t be human if he didn’t feel something at the sight of Gabriel Jesus so utterly failing to stake a claim to a regular starting spot when handed the chance in a big game.",
      "",
      "12. And we were certainly invested in the idea of Ben White scoring an equaliser and then celebrating in Steve Holland’s face. Although even here we saw doubt and uncertainty from Arsenal where none has existed before. Hincapie’s return and White’s deployment in the reshuffle from the bench meant Myles Lewis-Skelly once again reduced to a watching brief.",
      "There still appears to be a lack of real belief in the youngster when the chips are truly down.",
      "",
      "13. Arsenal scored an equaliser of such unparalleled Arsenalness that it barely requires description. The words ‘corner’ and ‘Merino’ and ‘bundled’ and ‘goalline technology’ are all you need to know to form a perfect image of it all in your mind. Or failing that, in your planet-melting AI of choice.",
      "A subdued Emirates suddenly came alive with expectation. A horribly unpleasant afternoon was now pregnant with the possibility of some real Hallmark of Champions behaviour and possibly even some stern words and tut-tutting from the Celebration Police. There was surely only one winner from here, you thought to yourself.",
      "",
      "14. And you were right. In fairness, this is where a degree of caution must be particularly advised for those going all-in on Carrick’s club-knowing DNA-possessing Unitedness being the difference maker in a big away game at a long-term rival.",
      "Because really what United went and did here under Carrick is just what they went and did under Amorim at Anfield; after conceding a late equaliser, they went and found a late winner.",
      "It was another stunning goal, wonderfully and precisely worked with no panic or late-game-bluster before Matheus Cunha calmly curled the ball into the bottom corner from 25 yards like it was a tap-in.",
      "And as a general point, it does become even harder to avoid the temptation to compare this United to previous all-conquering iterations when they do this sort of thing to league leaders while dressed as the 1994 team in that wonderful black Eric Cantona kung-fu tribute kit.",
      "",
      "15. Victory finally takes United into a wide-open top four that has been waiting for them all season long. Nobody appears remotely interested in what is for now (but almost certainly won’t end up being) the final Champions League spot, with United among the most egregious offenders with all manner of daft results against daft teams when opportunity knocked previously.",
      "Now, after back-to-back wins against teams that are not daft, the chance has been taken. And there really does seem no good reason to think United can’t remain precisely where they now find themselves given who they’ve now eliminated from their fixture list.",
      "Nobody could accuse United of appointing an interim at a time designed to give him a straightforward start, but having beaten City and Arsenal it really could get even better for a while yet.",
      "United, infamously, are not overburdened with fixtures for the rest of the season, but even so they have what looks like an outrageously gentle February after this potentially punishing end to January.",
      "If they can avoid the classic ‘win the hard games, then mess up the easier ones’ trope, then a February featuring Fulham and Tottenham at home before trips to West Ham and Everton could be a rewarding one. Haircuts all round if that lot goes the way current form suggests it should.",
      "",
      "16. For Arsenal, a first home defeat of the season. And the loss of that 24-0-0 record in all competitions when scoring first. And three goals conceded in a Premier League game for the first time since a 4-3 win over Luton Town in December 2023.",
      "We haven’t crunched all the numbers but are going to say that it must at the very, very least be rare to concede three goals against a team that is relegated twice before you concede three goals to anyone else. If United get relegated twice before the next time Arsenal concede three then we’re all in trouble.",
      "The ridiculousness of that stat and indeed the nature of the goals Arsenal conceded today – two worldies, one silly gift – should also be a reminder of just how ridiculous and unbreakable that Chelsea goals conceded statistic really is.",
      "There was some talk earlier in the season that Arsenal could threaten the absurd 15-goal mark of Terry and Carvalho and Cech and, above all, Mourinho. We get it; Arsenal are an exceptional football team who at their best specialise in denying their opponents any chances whatsoever.",
      "But the fact that record is already off the table with 15 games still to play should give anyone pause next time someone comes along with an impressive pair of centre-backs and high-class goalkeeper.",
      "We have moved Bruno Fernandes into position behind Erling Haaland as Bruno Guimaraes comes into central midfield.",
      "We can’t stress enough the importance of clubs at home and abroad doing everything possible to deny Arsenal the quadruple. These ten January transfers would help.",
      "If, like Roy Keane, you believe Michael Carrick isn’t a long-term manager for Manchester United, then you’ve got to say who is and somehow prove it.",
      "Chelsea fans have witnessed some truly baffling decisions being made at their club in the three-and-half years of BlueCo rule. They won’t stand for Palmer leaving for Man Utd.",
      "Arne Slot, Oliver Glasner and Thomas Frank will surely all be out of work soon, while Manchester United and West Ham being sensible does not feel right.",
      "With Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League now a useless four points, it is clear It Is Happening Again. But what even is a Bottle Job?"

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Gordon McQueen died aged 70 in June 2023 after contracting vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Coroner finds heading 'likely' contributed to brain injury behind death of former Scotland, Manchester United and Leeds defender",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 22:08, UK",
      "Heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain injury which was a factor in the death of former Scotland defender Gordon McQueen, a coroner has found.",
      "McQueen - who was capped for Scotland 30 times between 1974 and 1981, and played for both Manchester United and Leeds during a 16-year career - died at his home in North Yorkshire in June 2023, aged 70.",
      "The cause of death was pneumonia as he had become frail and bed-bound for months, the inquest in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard earlier this month.",
      "That frailty was due to a combination of vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), coroner Jon Heath said.",
      "The coroner gave a narrative conclusion on Monday, finding that McQueen died from pneumonia as a consequence of mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "He said: \"It is likely that repetitive head impacts sustained by heading the ball while playing football contributed to the CTE.\"",
      "McQueen's TV presenter daughter Hayley McQueen was in court to hear the findings.",
      "When giving evidence at his inquest earlier this month, she was asked by her barrister Michael Rawlinson KC if her father had discussed whether anything in his past history was behind his dementia.",
      "She said: \"He said 'heading a football for all those years probably hasn't helped'.\"",
      "McQueen said her dad was relatively injury-free during his career but did suffer some concussions, adding: \"They would just head back out and play.\"",
      "She also recalled how, when she was young, he would come home from training with Manchester United and lie down in a darkened room with a headache.",
      "She described how her father was very healthy and active - both in sport and with his family - during his playing days and after he retired.",
      "But she said the family began to notice changes in his personality after his 60th birthday.",
      "McQueen said her father had always been very sociable and outgoing, but became more withdrawn.",
      "She said that although her father was a central defender, he was well known for scoring goals from set-pieces, usually with his head.",
      "He came to prominence in England following his move to Leeds from St Mirren in 1972, helping the Yorkshire club to league title success in 1973-74 and playing a key role in their run to the European Cup final in 1975.",
      "McQueen then joined Leeds's arch-rivals Manchester United in 1978 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1983.",
      "Injury robbed him of a World Cup appearance in 1978 after he had been included in Scotland's squad having made his senior debut in 1974 against Belgium.",
      "After retiring as a player, McQueen had a brief spell as Airdrie manager and coach at former club St Mirren, and spent five years as coach at Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson until 2001.",
      "The inquest heard how McQueen's family donated his brain, after his death, to Professor Willie Stewart - a consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, who has conducted extensive research into brain injury in footballers and rugby players.",
      "Prof Stewart told the inquest he found evidence of CTE - a brain disorder linked to repeated head impacts - and vascular dementia.",
      "Prof Stewart agreed with Mr Rawlinson, for the McQueen family, when he asked whether the CTE \"more than minimally, negligibly or trivially\" contributed to the death and that \"heading the ball\" contributed to the CTE.",
      "The professor said the only evidence available was McQueen's \"high exposure\" to heading a football."

      "Michael Carrick has got off to the dream start as head coach of Manchester United until the end of the season; But are wins against Man City and Premier League leaders Arsenal enough to justify a premature permanent appointment?",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 17:29, UK",
      "Manchester United fans should not get carried away with Michael Carrick. But why not?",
      "So far, Carrick has shown you do not need to \"suffer\" to win football matches; instead, he's proved football is a simple game.",
      "But the dilemma now is whether he merits the permanent role, or, despite an apparent turnaround at Old Trafford, United should still bite the bullet and stick to their original plan to appoint a different permanent Ruben Amorim successor.",
      "Some fans have made up their minds and the players are rejuvenated but Roy Keane and Gary Neville remain cautious.",
      "Keane says United need a manager \"who you feel can get them winning league titles\", while before the derby day win and the victory at league leaders Arsenal, Neville said there \"cannot be any consideration\" that Carrick takes the job.",
      "However, the football United fans have been exposed to against Man City and Arsenal, the two sides at the top of the Premier League, cannot be taken for granted.",
      "As Carrick celebrated Patrick Dorgu's zinger to make it 2-1 at Arsenal, Neville said the stand-in United boss had put his hands up like the \"messiah\". What United have been exposed to in just two games is what they have been waiting for and prophesied about for over a decade.",
      "The football taught by Carrick works because, rather than treating the game like an exact science, he has allowed it to become an art of self-expression.",
      "Players playing to their strengths with the added pinch of nostalgia has been the recipe for Carrick's early success, with the squad no longer demanded to follow an elaborate instruction manual that never really makes clear what the final product would be.",
      "Carrick's United are direct, front-foot and have thus far been the perfect advert of \"United DNA\", averaging more fast breaks than any other team in the league.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo leads the line because he's made the most runs in behind per 90 in the Premier League this season. Bruno Fernandes is back in his favoured No 10 position as he remains one of the league's most potent chance creators. Dorgu has remained as a wide player because of his consistent displays high up the pitch.",
      "With very little time on the training pitch after taking on his team mid-season, there have been very few complaints from Carrick about his current situation. Why would there be? He's been given a free hit at Old Trafford, just as he was given one in 2021, following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As he did then, reinstalling fundamentals has become a stroke of genius.",
      "In truth, it's all the makings of what United would hope to see in the first two games of any new permanent manager. Perhaps if it wasn't Carrick, perhaps if it was someone new in the dugout, there'd be a unanimous acceptance that he should be the next man in charge. Unfortunately, United have been here before.",
      "In December 2018, a harrowing 3-1 defeat at Liverpool meant that Jose Mourinho's time at United was called to a close.",
      "United was described as toxic as Old Trafford soured under Mourinho, who grew grumpy in the role and was losing favour amongst the playing squad. Solskjaer came in and had an opportunity to stamp his mark and did so in style.",
      "A 5-1 victory at Cardiff set Solskjaer and United on a trail of 12 matches without defeat in the Premier League. With positivity flowing through the place, the change in style to something more akin to the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "As we've seen under Carrick, there's something about a side fearless in transition that United fans love to watch.",
      "After winning 14 of his 19 interim matches, including an incredible comeback win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Solskjaer was named United's permanent manager in March 2019. Solskjaer's interim efforts propelled United's top-four chances at the time.",
      "However, after United appointed Solskjaer, everyone returned from the honeymoon and to a dose of realism that Solskjaer was an inexperienced manager whose positive energy outweighed his proficiency in the role. United quickly crashed and burned that season, winning just two of their last eight, missing out on the top four.",
      "Throughout Solskjaer's three years in charge, a similar pattern sustained. United would go on to finish third and second under Solskjaer, but notoriously couldn't get over the line to achieve material success.",
      "United fans look back at their time under Solskjaer, perhaps as fondly as any time since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, but there was ultimately nothing tangible gained under the manager who made United simply \"feel good\".",
      "Under Solskjaer, United were a nearly team, reaching multiple semi-finals in all the cup competitions before a Europa League final in 2021 ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal.",
      "David de Gea's missed penalty is viewed by many as the true sliding doors moment that led to Solskjaer's ultimate demise in the role but the reality was that United were serial losers when push came to shove.",
      "There's an underlying resistance to repeat the same mistake with Carrick. When United opted to appoint Solskjaer permanently, the regime at the time, in the same breath, lost the chance to appoint Zinedine Zidane and Mauricio Pochettino, who at that time were the outstanding rumoured candidates.",
      "Should United appoint Carrick permanently, they will miss out on tapping into the thriving economy of available managers to do what they have tried in the past.",
      "There's no reason to suggest Carrick would be the same or worse than Solskjaer, but after years of experimenting, the next decision on United manager feels like the most significant one yet.",
      "It could be the difference between returning to a side worthy of the name and reputation or remaining in a cycle of failure.",
      "On current evidence, Carrick would be an astute appointment. But if United want to do something new, however well Carrick does, he shouldn't be among the future candidates. Fans will get carried away, as fans are allowed to. INEOS, though, have another era-defining decision to make.",

      "Substitute Cunha curled a stunning finish into the corner from 25 yards out, only three minutes after Mikel Merino had hauled the lacklustre hosts level from a Bukayo Saka corner.",
      "Earlier, Arsenal had squandered a lead when Martin Zubimendi's poor pass allowed Bryan Mbeumo to run through on goal and beat David Raya after Lisandro Martinez had diverted Martin Odegaard's cross-shot into his own net for the opening goal.",
      "Arsenal struggled to regain their composure after Mbeumo's leveller and Manchester United, 2-0 winners over Manchester City in Carrick's first game in charge last weekend, went in front when Patrick Dorgu crashed a superb effort in off the bar.",

      "Mikel Arteta tried to change the flow of the game by making a quadruple substitution before the hour mark, but Arsenal continued to flounder before finally restoring parity when Merino prodded over the line for yet another set-piece goal.",
      "At that point, it seemed Arsenal might go on and find a winner, but Cunha silenced the Emirates Stadium when his stunning, long-range effort sparked more wild Manchester United celebrations. There were boos from some home fans at the final whistle.",
      "The victory continues a dream start in the dugout for head coach Carrick, and leaves alarm bells ringing for Arsenal, whose lead at the top of the Premier League is reduced from seven to four points following Manchester City and Aston Villa's wins.",
      "Having been held to goalless draws against Nottingham Forest and Liverpool in their previous two Premier League games, Arsenal are now without a win in three as Manchester United continue to push for a Champions League finish in fourth.",

      "\"It wasn't good enough from us. We need some time to analyse it now but it was not good enough, the performance. We should have done better but now is the time to stick together even more and keep working, be together, and bounce back.",
      "\"In the first half, we were the better team, scored the goal and had control of the game but we had a lot of giveaways in the game that created dangerous moments and in the second half the game changed a little bit.",
      "\"We know the quality they have when they get the space to run. In the second half, there were a lot of duels they won that gave them the momentum of the game and let them run and we never really managed to get into that rhythm of creating chances.",
      "\"It was never going to be easy in this league, we know that. Now is the time to be strong. We are still top of the league so we have to keep going and bounce back straight away.\"",

      "\"To come here and score three goals in the manner we did, going one down, coming back, then the setback, and still keeping going - it was a huge moment for us.",
      "\"The boys had to put an awful lot in today. It probably didn't come as easy as it did last week. Last week, the time, the flow of the game and the momentum was with us pretty much throughout, whereas today we had to dig deep.",

      "Since the 2-1 win at Fulham on December 7, it's now eight without a win in the Premier League.",

      "They've picked up two points in the league across that run and scored only three goals, while shipping 18.",
      "There were plenty of signs they can avoid being dragged into the mix-up as it takes shape in the coming weeks, but right now, they just need a win, and with tricky trips to Nottingham Forest and Brighton up next, it's hard to see where it is going to come from.Dan Long",

      "The hosts had two gilt-edged chances before half-time, attempted 35 crosses but only forced Matz Sels into one real save across 90 minutes at the Gtech. They faced a Forest side playing peak Sean Dyche football for much of the game, but one they played into the hands of.",
      "Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will head and kick everything away all day. Brentford did not move Forest around enough, and on the rare occasion they did manufacture something from a clever pass they nearly scored.",
      "The timing of the visitors' two goals, book-ending the game as they did, could not have been much better and showed up a Brentford attack which laboured but had few ideas to combat the visitors' low block.",
      "Brentford will not face Dyche every week. But losing Mikkel Damsgaard to a suspected knee injury will not aid their cause given a lack of real creative alternatives in midfield. Keith Andrews himself said it had been a delight to watch the Danish midfielder play - and he will hope more than anyone that his diagnosis is not serious.Ron Walker",
      "Newcastle's summer recruitment in forward areas was meant to soften the blow of life without Alexander Isak. Instead, it's starting to underline just how hard he is to replace.",
      "The 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa felt like a case study in attacking shortfall. Plenty of effort, plenty of running but very little incision. When the game needed a spark, Eddie Howe turned to his bench and got no real lift.",
      "Jacob Ramsey, Anthony Elanga and Nick Woltemade - a combined cost of £175m - were all given opportunities but the game passed them by. Ramsey looked lost, Elanga's pace never translated into end product and Woltemade looked isolated against Villa's centre-backs.",
      "Meanwhile, Yoane Wissa, another summer recruit, couldn't find space to threaten from the start.",
      "This is where Isak's absence looms large. He doesn't just score goals, his movement and intelligence won Newcastle games. Without him, the attack looks flatter, easier to contain and more predictable.",
      "Recruitment is always judged over time, but right now the early evidence suggests Newcastle haven't found the right blend to cover for Isak's unique profile.Lewis Jones",
      "Joao Pedro was the player of the match at Crystal Palace but Estevao continues to excite. The 18-year-old Brazilian became the youngest Chelsea player to score and assist in the same Premier League match since Neil Shipperley in 1993. Different times.",
      "His goal in the 3-1 win was superb, showing not just pace but skill and strength to hold off a quality defender in Tyrick Mitchell. The finish was emphatic, ramming the ball beyond Dean Henderson. No wonder Chelsea supporters want to see more of him.",
      "This was Estevao's first goal since the win over Barcelona in November, although Chelsea as a whole have been a little out of sorts since then. This was a first Premier League away win since beating Burnley that month, ending a run of five without a win.",
      "There are a plethora of options for Liam Rosenior in the attacking positions at Chelsea. That, coupled with some fitness issues, has led to Estevao making more of his appearances off the bench than from the start since losing to Leeds in early December.",
      "But Estevao's potential far outstrips that of his peers in Chelsea blue - not just for the future but the here and now. No player has scored more goals for the club at the same age during the Premier League era. His impact at Selhurst Park feels like just the start.Adam Bate",

      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick is relishing the opportunity for his side to prove themselves against league leaders Arsenal after a dream start at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick, who is in interim charge of United until the end of the season, got off to a winning start as he led his side to a 2-0 derby day win at Old Trafford. It was a performance that earned plaudits for a dominant attacking display.",
      "The former United midfielder is preparing his side for another test against an Arsenal side that are in the driving seat to end a 22-year wait for a Premier League title.",
      "United travel to the Emirates, where the Gunners haven't lost a single game at the Emirates this season, searching for a first Premier League win at Arsenal since 2017.",
      "However, Carrick may take some added confidence given the fact that when he last took on Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, the 44-year-old guided United to a 3-2 victory in 2021, while in caretaker charge.",
      "\"I think Mikel's done a really good job assembling a team that can do so many things well. That in itself is a challenge.",
      "\"The wide men are dangerous one-vs-one. They fill the box and they get a good balance within the team, how they attack, how they defend.",
      "\"They're all a team and they all play their part. It's not necessarily one individual who carries them. Again, from a coaching point of view, credit to Mikel for that.",
      "\"Set plays, they're a threat as well. That's why they're sitting at the top of the league and that's why they're doing so well at the moment in the Champions League.",
      "\"The feeling we've taken over the last week or two in the game and the training, The boys feel in a good place and are looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It's a challenge, we know that, but we can go there and we can face it head-on. We've got good players and we're a good team as well, so we've just proved that. We need to keep proving it as we go.\"",
      "Recalling the win over Arteta's Arsenal in 2021, Carrick added: \"There's not much to take from that moving into this one. It's a whole new challenge, a whole new game, a whole new group of players. More feeding off what we've done this week, going into the game and looking forward to it.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta expects Manchester United to bring \"intensity\" and \"new ideas\" under Carrick as Arsenal aim to get back to winning ways following goalless draws against Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Arsenal boss is especially wary of their counter-attacking threat having watched them ruthlessly punish Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in last weekend's Manchester derby.",
      "\"Michael coming in will bring new ideas,\" he said. \"Always, the intensity rises up.",
      "\"You could see that in the Manchester derby, the kind of behaviours and the game that they played, so we will expect a really tough match and we'll adapt to that for sure.",
      "\"But we are at home and we know how important that game is for us.",
      "\"They are so good in a lot of departments, but it is clear that when that team has a space to go in a certain place to activate or run, they become lethal.",
      "\"You saw that a few days ago in Manchester. They have a lot of attributes to cause you problems. But as well, like every team, they have their weaknesses as well.",
      "\"Historically, there has always been something very linked to that,\" he added of their counter-attacking threat. \"And the profile of players that they always have and certain individuals that are so good at activating those spaces as well.",
      "\"I don't know the stats exactly, but for sure, they are one of the best.\"",
      "Arteta also recalled his meetings with Carrick as a player. \"One of my favourite No 6s,\" he said. \"Very intelligent, looked like he could never break sweat, he was so in control of the games.\"",
      "Of their previous meeting as coaches, Arsenal's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford in December 2021, Arteta added: \"Not great memories, so we have to change them.\"",
