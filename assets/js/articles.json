      "Everton's Idrissa Gana Gueye has taken to Instagram to apologise after being shown a red card for slapping his own team-mate during Monday's win at Manchester United.",
      "The incident occurred in the 13th minute when Gueye and Michael Keane had a heated exchange following a shot at goal by Bruno Fernandes. However, replays of the incident showed Gueye raising his hand and striking Keane in the face. Referee Tony Harrington had no hesitation but to hand Gueye a straight red card.",
      "Despite being down to 10 men, Everton managed to secure an important win with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall scoring the winner in the first half.",
      "After the game, Gueye issued an apology and took responsibility for his actions. \"I want to apologise first to my team-mate Michael Keane. I take full responsibility for my reaction. I also apologise to my team-mates, the staff, the fans and the club,\" he said on his Instagram story.",
      "\"What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions run high but nothing justifies such behaviour. I'll make sure it never happens again.\"",
      "\"I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it. I got told that the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.",
      "\"But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we get the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our teammates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",
      "Delivering his assessment on Gueye's red card, match-winner Dewsbury-Hall said: \"It was just a moment of madness. It was obviously avoidable. All I can say is Idrissa apologised to us all at half-time and said his piece. That's all he can do and we move on from it.",
      "\"The reaction from the lads after it was unbelievable, top tier. We could've easily crumbled, gone in on ourselves and lost the game comfortably, but it probably made us grow even more as a team.",
      "\"The manager just said he would deal with the situation another time and it was just about keeping to the plan that we had. He just wanted us to continue what we were doing and focus on the things we can change.\"",

      "Gary Neville has criticised Manchester United's performance in their 1-0 defeat to Everton, which saw their unbeaten streak come to an abrupt halt. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall netted the only goal of the match, handing United their fourth Premier League loss this season.",
      "The game will be remembered for an incident in the first half where Idrissa Gueye seemed to slap his own Everton teammate, Michael Keane, resulting in the Toffees being reduced to 10 men for most of the match.",
      "Despite having a numerical advantage, United failed to capitalise and suffered their first league defeat since September 27 against Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim and his team are now gearing up to take on Crystal Palace in their upcoming Premier League match at the weekend, where they'll be eager to bounce back with a win.",
      "The ex-United star also criticised Luke Shaw's performance in the second half as United were desperately seeking an equaliser. Neville pointed out the imbalance between the number of United defenders and the Everton players they were marking during an Everton goal-kick.",
      "\"You've got five defenders at the back. Why? And they didn't even win the header. Or the second ball. Embarrassing,\" Neville said on commentary.",
      "The United legend added: \"[Luke] Shaw has started to move forward a little bit but he's ambling forward let's be clear.",
      "\"He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes and I am just going to say it. Look at him. You can't do that.",
      "\"You should be running forward every single time. I don't care. \"What he is doing there is a waste of time, you're not conning anybody. I am not having it.\"",
      "Neville also offered his thoughts on referee Tony Harrington's decision to issue a red card to Gueye during in the first half at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It's a coming together between him and Michael Keane. It always looks unsavoury when it's teammate on teammate,\" said Neville at the time of the red card.",
      "\"Idrissa Gueye has gone over to Keane - he hasn't really reacted. He just pushes him, and then there's not much in it. There's not much in it. I mean, I think Jordan Pickford does a very good job [breaking it up] to be fair to him.\"",
      "Former Everton boss Roberto Martinez maintained the referee had little choice but to issue the red card to Gueye.",
      "\"No I was very surprised because you need to be intense,\" said Martinez. \"You need to be intense. The reaction here, you've got a lot of bodies in the box.",
      "\"Obviously it's a bit of a misunderstanding [Gueye trying to play the ball to Keane and they blame each other]. Clearly it's a misunderstanding, Gueye is trying to play the ball but it's that reaction here, that slap, open hand.",
      "\"We've been talking about it many times. I think the referee has no other choice. When you see it there, the law tells you any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",

It was Keane's second slap of the night after his own teammate, Idrissa Gueye, was shown a red card for hitting the England international in a bizarre incident in the first half.",
      "The two players were involved in a heated exchange before coming together just 13 minutes into the Premier League clash at Old Trafford, and had to be separated by Jordan Pickford. Gueye was visibly annoyed after Keane took umbrage as some poor play resulted in a United attack.",

      "On a remarkable night, Idrissa Gueye was sent off for striking Keane following a first half clash between the warring duo. But despite being down to 10 men inside the 14th minute, David Moyes's side went on to secure a famous win and bring United's unbeaten run to a shuddering halt. And in doing so, Everton become the first side in history to win a Premier League game on this ground, having gone a man down.",
      "It was all thanks to a stunning first half strike from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, which ruined the 12th month anniversary of Ruben Amorim.",
      "If Amorim could have picked one opponent to help him extend United's unbeaten run to six games, it would have been Everton. United had beaten them more times in the top flight than anyone else (42). While the Merseyside outfit arrived in Manchester with just two wins to their name on this ground since the inception of the Premier League.",
      "Moyes, meanwhile, had never won here as an opposition manager. He didn't win much here when he was United manager, come to think of it.",
      "But if he could buck the trend and leave Old Trafford with three points, it would have lifted his side above Liverpool in the table. That should have been a huge incentive to the Scot - he just never imagined how the end of his personal hoodoo would play out.",
      "United were also missing Matheus Cunha with a head injury which had also forced him to pull out of switching on the Christmas lights in Altrincham last weekend. This resulted in a rare start for Joshua Zirkzee - his first for 225 days. The same one which saw Rory McIlroy win the Masters.",
      "Everton started well, with a flowing move needing Leny Yoro to stop Iliman Ndiaye's cross from reaching the waiting Thierno Barry. Ndiaye then curled a shot wide as United struggled to get out of their own half.",
      "Then all hell broke loose with Gueye's moment of madness, leaving his side down to 10 men after just 13 minutes. He had to be escorted off the pitch by peacemaker Jordan Pickford, while Keane waved Gueye off following the controversial decision of referee Tony Harrington. Not that it bothered the visitors, who went and took the lead on 29 minutes with a stunning strike from Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "Patrick Dorgu should have equalised, but shot wide when it looked easier to score. While Amad Diallo jinked into the box, but also failed to hit the target.",
      "Pickford then produced a world class save to keep out a long range pile driver from Bruno Fernandes. Everton had something to cling to, and looked determined keep hold of their lead. Whatever it took.",
      "Amorim threw on Mason Mount in the hope of finding some spark. And Mount curled a shot a whisker wide, while Pickford denied Bryan Mbeumo with another top class save. And two even better ones to keep out headers from Zirkzee.",
      "The visitors were showing fighting spirt for all the right reasons this time, leaving United becoming more desperate. And it was that man Keane who led Everton's rearguard action, producing some crucial blocks and tackles as United piled forward.",

      "Manchester United wasted the chance to move back into the Premier League top four after being beaten by ten-man Everton at Old Trafford on Monday evening.",
      "The drama started within the opening 15 minutes as Everton star Idrissa Gueye was sent off after clashing with teammate Michael Keane. Despite the disadvantage, the Toffees rallied and even took a surprise lead thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's eye-catching strike.",
      "United pushed for an equaliser but found England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as an unbeatable barrier. And his performance was crucial to the Toffees holding on to secure what was an unlikely victory.",
      "Here are all of the talking points from Old Trafford:",
      "Midfielder Gueye has been one of Everton's most consistent players over recent seasons but a sheer moment of madness saw him dismissed at Old Trafford. After clashing with his own teammate Michael Keane, Gueye appeared to raise his hand to the defender's face.",
      "The pair were embroiled in an angry argument, with Gueye striking out and earning himself a red card. It's one thing getting dismissed after a bad tackle or becoming frustrated with the opposition, but it's another earning an early bath for a fight with your own teammate.",
      "He now faces an automatic three-match ban for violent conduct. There's no doubt that boss David Moyes will be absolutely furious - and rightly so.",
      "With nearly 80 minutes to come against ten men, the Red Devils had a real opportunity ahead of them. Not that you'd have known it throughout the majority of the first period as Everton claimed a shock lead.",
      "It was a stunning goal from midfielder Dewsbury-Hall that broke the deadlock. He picked the ball up outside of the penalty area, shrugged off a couple of challenges and curled a brilliant effort past the despairing dive of Senne Lammens.",
      "It was an eye-catching display from the midfielder, who now seems to be at home in the Premier League.",
      "After being involved in the incident that saw Gueye dismissed, former United defender Keane was then at the heart of one of the flashpoints of the second period as the hosts pushed for an equaliser.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, who was the Red Devils' most threatening player throughout the game, appeared to have a great chance as the ball dropped to him in the penalty area. As he stretched to fire home, he appeared to be caught by Keane, who also threw a boot out.",
      "It appeared as though United had a great shout for a spot-kick but replays showed that Keane got a slight touch on the ball before catching Mbeumo.",
      "After a memorable international fortnight where he extended his record-breaking run without conceding a goal for England, Everton stopper Jordan Pickford was at it again. The stopper produced a host of impressive stops to keep United at bay.",
      "The most spectacular save of Pickford's showreel at Old Trafford came as he denied Bruno Fernandes from range. He then made a couple of brilliant stops to tip away goal-bound headers from Joshua Zirkzee.",

      "Jamie Carragher believes referee Tony Harrington could have 'managed the situation' leading up to Idrissa Gueye's bizarre red card, after the Everton star was sent off for slapping his own teammate against Manchester United.",
      "Gueye was shown his marching orders in the 13th minute at Old Trafford following a skirmish with Michael Keane. The Senegal international appeared to be unhappy with centre-back Keane after a miscommunication which led to the midfielder giving the ball away inside his own half.",
      "After words were exchanged, the pair came to head-to-head inside the 18-yard box before Gueye raised his right arm and looked to then slap Keane right on the side of his face. Once Gueye made contact with Keane's face, Harrington was in no hesitation but to give him a straight red card.",
      "\"Could you just get the two of them together and say 'eh, behave yourselves'. Sort of manage the situation rather than say 'that's the rule book, I am just going off exactly that. When you actually look at the rules it actually gives the referee a bit of an out.\"",
      "Ex-Everton manager Roberto Martinez also commented on the incident, saying: \"No I was very surprised because you need to be intense. You need to be intense. The reaction here, you've got a lot of bodies in the box.",
      "\"Obviously it's a bit of a misunderstanding [Gueye trying to play the ball to Keane and they blame each other]. Clearly it's a misunderstanding, Gueye is trying to play the ball but it's that reaction here, that slap, open hand.",
      "\"We've been talking about it many times. I think the referee has no other choice. When you see it there, the law tells you any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",
      "Speaking just moments after Gueye was sent off, Neville said on co-commentary: \"It's a coming together between him and Michael Keane. It always looks unsavoury when it's teammate on teammate.",
      "\"Idrissa Gueye has gone over to Keane - he hasn't really reacted. He just pushes him, and then there's not much in it. There's not much in it. I mean, I think Jordan Pickford does a very good job [breaking it up] to be fair to him.\"",

      "Everton are set to be without Idrissa Gueye for some time following his strange red card against Manchester United. The Toffees' midfielder was shown a straight red card after slapping teammate Michael Keane during a disagreement on the pitch, with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford having to get in between the two.",
      "The referee saw the incident and quickly brandished the red card to Gueye. VAR checked the decision and agreed with the red card.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre official X account explained: \"The referee's call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.\"",

      "The red card won't only see Gueye miss the remainder of Everton's match against United. Being sent off for violent conduct means that he will also face a three-game ban.",
      "He will therefore miss Premier League games against Newcastle (H), Bournemouth (A) and Nottingham Forest (H). The midfielder is also likely to receive a fine from the FA and possibly even his own club.",
      "The ban means that Gueye is not going to be available for Everton very much over the next couple of months. The suspension means that he could make a comeback against Chelsea on 13 December.",
      "However, his participation in the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal means that he could again be unavailable until mid-January when the tournament finishes.",
      "The competition starts on Sunday, 21 December, meaning that he is unlikely to be unavailable for Everton for their Premier League clash against Arsenal on Saturday, 20 December - and could even miss the clash against Chelsea the week before, depending on when he heads to Morocco.",
      "Despite the player disadvantage, Everton took the lead in the first half through summer signing Kieran Dewsbury-Hall. The midfielder put the ball into the net in the 29th minute giving Everton something to hold on to.",

The 25-year-old returned to the starting XI for Los Verdiblancos after the November international break, as his team faced Girona in a La Liga encounter.",
      "Girona grabbed a shock opener through Vladyslav Vanat, before Real Betis levelled matters through Valentin Gomez, with both sides pushing for a decisive goal. That crucial second goal remained out of reach, despite the hosts' relentless efforts, which proved overzealous at times; Antony's determination ultimately led to a sending-off.",
      "The Brazilian attempted an overhead kick to control the ball, but inadvertently caught Joel Roca in the face, an incident that was reviewed and punished following a VAR check.",
      "He later shared a message on his Instagram story, which was translated from Spanish, stating: \"Very sad about the red card! All I wanted was to help my team win!\".",
      "\"A completely unintentional play. Sorry to all the fans who have always supported me!\"",
      "Antony now faces a period on the sidelines as he completes his ban for the dismissal, casting a shadow over what has otherwise been an encouraging beginning to his permanent spell with Real Betis.",
      "This season, the 25-year-old has registered four goals and one assist across nine La Liga matches, adapting well to a new league setting.",
      "That scenario nearly played out differently, though, with Antony revealing that Bayern Munich had held discussions about a potential transfer during the summer window, after the German giants struggled to secure attacking reinforcements.",
      "Whilst this caught many off guard, Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund recently confirmed to Sky Germany: \"This period wasn't exactly quiet. A lot happened. We were involved with several players, Antony was one of them.",
      "\"There was also a conversation, but that is in the past. We are very happy with how the squad is currently set up. In the end, at the close of the transfer window, we came out well and are satisfied.\"",
      "However, Antony chose to rejoin Real Betis instead, where supporters have embraced him warmly, even applauding him following a red card incident.",

Casemiro's deal runs until 2026, and although his displays have been notable this term, doubts surround his long-term prospects beyond the summer window.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid Shea Lacey is poised to make his mark on the first team in the coming weeks. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will soon jet off for the Africa Cup of Nations, meaning opportunities are up for grabs.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to bolster his attacking line-up, and the 18-year-old winger could make his senior debut for the club he has supported since childhood. Even before he started knocking on the door of the first team, Lacey had already amassed a significant following on social media.",
      "As he ascended through the academy ranks, his performances caught the eye of many online, with clips of his standout moments frequently going viral. Lacey, who once outshone Lamine Yamal to clinch a player of the tournament award in his youth, got his first taste of senior football over the summer.",
      "He joined Amorim's squad for a post-season tour of Asia, impressing enough to earn a spot in the United pre-season squad. His progress has reportedly excited many within the club.",
      "As the new Premier League season kicked off, Lacey returned to the Under-21s, where he has since netted three goals and provided two assists in nine outings. With Mbeumo and Amad due to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations next month, a senior debut for the youngster is on the horizon.",
      "Amorim may even include Lacey in the United squad for Monday night's showdown with Everton at Old Trafford. The Portuguese boss has previously voiced his belief in the teenager, stating he's ready to 'step up'.",
      "Looking ahead to the Reds' meeting with David Moyes' team, Amorim addressed how he plans to cope with the loss of Amad and Mbeumo over the coming weeks. He said: \"I think it is going to be hard, but then, that is the good thing of the experience.",
      "\"We lived so many limitations last year. We changed in January, and we didn't bring the players, then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things. We are prepared for that. It will be hard for us, but we have different baggage to deal with that.",
      "\"Guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea [Lacey], they can step up. We can send, at the same time, a message to everyone here in the academy that this is the future. But we are going to struggle, and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Speaking about the academy setup, Amorim continued: \"First of all, I'm not preparing the academy; they are preparing the academy. We are paying more attention to them; we are talking with them. That is so important to change information about the players, what they need, and how they behave.",
      "\"To call a kid for the first team, they need to behave really well. This connection is really important. We are trying to do that. We are putting everything in place; nutrition is for the academy, and it starts now. In our club, that is something that should be basic.",
      "\"So, all these things we are doing, and they are doing their job. I have more time with them in training, so I'm more confident with them. When we put these kids to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but they will struggle less, I think. Everyone in the Academy is doing very well in the moment.\"",
      "Lacey has the same talent management agency that represents Wayne Rooney. And the United legend is more than aware of the teenager's potential, having called him earlier this year to say: \"You're doing brilliant, keep doing what you're doing.\"",
      "The teenager has trained with England at St. George's Park this autumn. When pressed on Lacey's development, Amorim claimed he is delighted with his progress.",
      "\"I'm really happy with him, I think he struggled a little bit with injuries,\" said the United boss. \"He did a very good job balancing his body. You can sense he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training sessions are hard, but Premier League games with pressure are harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is being hampered by not having his best players at his disposal, according to former Premier League midfielder Ruud Gullit. The Red Devils have had a mixed start to the season, including a shocking defeat in the League Cup to League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "They'll be looking to continue their recent improved form on Monday night. United will take on Everton at Old Trafford in the 8pm kick-off, knowing that a win will take them up to fifth place.",
      "Amorim's team are unbeaten in their last five Premier League games, but they've had to settle for draws in their last two. The United manager was heavily backed with a net spend of around £170million this summer.",
      "It saw the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko touch down at the club. Despite that investment, Gullit believes that a lack of quality within the squad is one of Amorim's biggest challenges.",
      "\"I think it's always very difficult to get into a team halfway through the season. He did. So then you have half a season on and off,\" he exclusively said, via videogamer.com.",
      "\"Then he's been able to start a season with his own team and everything. But they still have some problems.",
      "\"The point is that the best players play somewhere else. They don't play for Man Utd at the moment.",
      "\"And so they have to deal with players that play already at their highest level. Can they do more? Not everyone. That's the difficulty, he has to do it with the players that he has.\"",
      "With the January transfer window now fast approaching, plans will be being put into place for any activity that happens at Old Trafford. United have already been linked with several possible incomings with concentration on their midfield.",
      "The club made an approach to Brighton for Carlos Baleba back in the summer. They have also been linked with an interest in England duo Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson.",
      "Talking about if signing a new midfielder in the January window is a priority, Amorim said: \"It's hard to say that, but we can add in the future.",
      "\"But I don't know when, different characteristics, the same thing that our thinking in front, sometimes it's not the quality of the players, it's the characteristics of the players and we can improve in some areas in our club.",
      "\"But I'm happy with the guys that we have in the moment and I think they have so much more to give. So it's my job to think about them, not other guys that are not here.\"",

      "Premier League clubs will be keeping a close eye on Vinicius Jr’s future after the player made it clear to Real Madrid that he will not consider signing a contract extension as things stand.",
      "The Brazilian winger has become a superstar at the Bernabeu following his arrival from Flamengo. But he could consider a move AWAY from the Bernabeu in the near future, with his relationship with new Real Madrid boss, Xabi Alonso, understood to be frosty.",
      "Vinicius, 25, was left furious after being taken off against Barcelona in the Clasico last month. And while he made a public apology to his teammates and supporters in the immediate aftermath, it does not appear to have repaired his relationship with the Los Blancos chief.",
      "According to The Athletic, Vinicius will not sign an extended contract with the club at this moment in time given his relationship with Alonso. The winger’s current deal runs until the summer of 2027, meaning Real could lose him for free in just 18 months.",
      "It is suggested that Vinicius made his feelings known in a meeting with club president Fiorentino Perez last month following his outburst during the Clasico. During his angry reaction to his substitution, the Brazilian was heard saying: “Always me, I’m leaving the team, it’s better if I leave, I’m leaving.”",
      "Vinicius penned a long apology on social media, albeit leaving Alonso out. Asked about that fact, the Real Madrid boss said: “Has Vinicius apologised to me? We had a meeting with everyone on Wednesday, and Vinicius was impeccable.",
      "“He spoke honestly and was very good. For me, that settles the matter. It was a very valuable, very positive statement. He demonstrated his honesty; he spoke from the heart.",
      "“What he said was the most important thing, and I was very satisfied. I've already said it, I was very proud and the matter was settled on Wednesday itself.”",
      "Should Vinicius angle to leave the club, a clutch of Premier League clubs will no doubt sit up and notice. Liverpool have been linked with a move for the winger in the past, while Manchester United have also been credited with a historical interest.",
      "Vinicius has so far scored 111 goals in 340 appearances for the Spanish side - five of those having come so far this season. Real Madrid are back in action on Wednesday as they take on Greek side Olympiacos on Wednesday ahead of a La Liga showdown with Girona.",

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 against Everton in the Premier League on Monday evening. Everton went down to 10 men just 13 minutes into the game when Idrissa Gueye was shown a red card for slapping his own teammate.",
      "Despite the early sending off, Everton were the better side and deserved to draw first blood through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who beat Senne Lammens from the edge of the box. United pushed for an equaliser but couldn't find a breakthrough as Jordan Pickford denied Joshua Zirkzee with an excellent late save.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Should have done better for Dewsbury-Hall's strike. His starting position made it difficult for him to get across to his left-hand side. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Didn't commit to the challenge when Dewsbury-Hall picked up the ball on the edge of the box, which proved costly. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Was caught out of position a few times when Everton looked dangerous in the first half. Didn't have much to do after the break when United finally started to ask a few questions. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Made an excellent challenge at the beginning of the second half and tried to rally his teammates as Everton held onto their one-goal advantage. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Didn't offer much going forward in the first 45 minutes and was hooked at the interval in a tactical tweak from Amorim. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Although Casemiro has become an influential figure again this season he looked like a 33-year-old and was passive. It wasn't a surprise to see him substituted in the 58th minute. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His passing was sloppy at times and he resorted to shooting from distance in an effort to get United back into the contest. Wasted a big chance from close range with 20 minutes remaining. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Looks low on confidence and was poor again at Old Trafford. He missed a decent chance in the first half - his end product must improve - and is likely to be replaced by Dalot at the weekend. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "The international break had the potential to disrupt Mbeumo's momentum. The 26-year-old showed determination on a night when United weren't at the races for large parts. 5",
      "Amad",
      "Was probably the pick of a bad bunch in the first half. Amad relocated to right wing-back when Mazraoui was brought off and he was still involved in most attacking phases of play. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "The highlight of Zirkzee's first half was his heated exchange with James Tarkowski. The Dutchman made his first start of the campaign and didn't do much until drawing a late save from Pickford. 4",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made a difference when he came on. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "An improvement on Dorgu. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Tried his best. 5",

      "Ruben Amorim waved his arms and screamed as Manchester United attempted to win the ball back from Everton. Amorim insisted after each win in October there was plenty more work to do and he was right.",
      "Everton had won just once at United in the Premier League in the past 32 years, a 1-0 triumph in 2013 under Roberto Martinez when David Moyes was managing in the home dugout.",
      "Moyes had not won at Old Trafford in 17 attempts as a visiting manager, so history was stacked against Everton, but he oversaw an unlikely victory with just 10 men on the pitch.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both were enforced, with Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha dropping out of the squad due to injury, opening the door for Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to start.",
      "The tactical battle was an interesting one in the opening exchanges. Everton played a high line and pressed with purpose. They wanted Senne Lammens to kick the ball long because they have the height to win aerial balls.",
      "James Tarkowski pushed Zirkzee to the floor in an off-the-ball incident. Zirkzee came close to squaring up with the defender, but referee Tony Harrington gave both a warning.",
      "There must have been something in the air because tensions then boiled over between Everton players. Idrissa Gana Gueye was unhappy with Michael Keane, and he slapped his own teammate in a moment of madness. Gueye was shown a red card and was red in the face as Jordan Pickford held him back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes stood yards away from the incident and couldn't believe what he was watching. The Everton analysts who were sitting in the press box looked equally dumbfounded.",
      "United had kept just one clean sheet in the league, which came against Sunderland, before the visit of Everton, but the sending off handed a huge opportunity to record another.",
      "That's without mentioning that Everton's strikers can't score for toffee. Thierno Barry was goalless in 11 league appearances but was given the nod to start, which meant Beto (one goal in 11) was on the bench. However, Iliman Ndiaye looked threatening at times and Jack Grealish was involved on the left.",
      "United started so badly that Gueye's sending off didn't stop Everton from being on the front foot. The travelling Evertonians chirped and erupted when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring.",
      "\"Hit it,\" shouted the Everton analyst. Leny Yoro didn't commit to the challenge and Lammens should have done better. The goalkeeper's starting position was poor and the shot was saveable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez returned to the squad after recovering from their respective injuries, although the latter's return was more significant given the length of his lay-off.",
      "Martinez had been sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury. It was great to see him back in the squad and he received a warm reception when he emerged to warm up.",
      "There was further applause for youngster Shea Lacey, who was named in a senior squad for the first time, reward for delivering consistently strong performances in academy fixtures. Lacey has a high ceiling and his squad inclusion is expected to be the first of many.",
      "Mani from The Stone Roses sadly passed away this month. United played \"I Want To Be Adored\" as kick-off approached, and \"This Is The One\" carried more meaning as the players walked out.",
      "The first half performance was reminiscent of last season. United must brush teams like Everton aside at home if they want to secure Champions League qualification next season. November started with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, but Everton was a much bigger setback.",
      "Most of those in red shirts looked disinterested in the first half, and Amorim hooked Noussair Mazraoui at the interval. Mason Mount was introduced and Amad relocated to right wing-back.",
      "Patrick Dorgu had another game to forget and was hauled off before the hour mark. The problem is his replacement, Diogo Dalot, has also been unconvincing from the left this season. The huge cheer for Mainoo as he replaced Casemiro showed what fans think about the handling of him.",
      "Amorim was widely praised after an excellent October, but United have not entered the winter as they would have liked. The games come thick and fast, and they must find another response.",
      "There were joyous scenes in the Everton section at the full-time whistle. Yoro slumped to his knees and Fernandes complained. The United captain should look at himself first after such a poor display.",
      "Moyes claimed an away win at Old Trafford on his 18th attempt. He'll argue it was worth the wait.",

      "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall scored the only goal of the game to hand United their fourth defeat in the Premier League this season. The game also saw Everton reduced to 10 men for much of the contest after Idrissa Gueye appeared to slap his own teammate, Michael Keane, in the first half.",
      "United had the numerical advantage for the majority of the game but could not make it count, as they fell to their first defeat in the league since September 27 against Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim and Co. will now prepare to face Crystal Palace in their next Premier League fixture at the weekend, where they will be determined to return to winning ways.",
      "It was also on commentary that Neville was not happy with a moment from Luke Shaw during the second half when United were trying to find an equaliser. Everton went long from a goal-kick as Neville highlighted the number of United players back in defence compared to the Everton players they were covering.",
      "\"You've got five defenders at the back. Why? And they didn't even win the header. Or the second ball. Embarrassing,\" Neville said.",
      "He added: \"[Luke] Shaw has started to move forward a little bit but he's ambling forward let's be clear.",
      "\"He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes and I am just going to say it. Look at him. You can't do that.",
      "\"You should be running forward every single time. I don't care. \"What he is doing there is a waste of time, you're not conning anybody. I am not having it.\"",
      "Neville also weighed in on the decision from referee Tony Harrington to send off Gueye in the first half for Everton. \"It's a coming together between him and Michael Keane. It always looks unsavoury when it's teammate on teammate,\" said Neville at the time of the incident.",
      "\"Idrissa Gueye has gone over to Keane - he hasn't really reacted. He just pushes him, and then there's not much in it. There's not much in it. I mean, I think Jordan Pickford does a very good job [breaking it up] to be fair to him.\"",
      "However, former Everton manager Roberto Martinez insisted the referee had no option but to show Gueye the red card.",

      "\"Obviously it's a bit of a misunderstanding [Gueye trying to play the ball to Keane and they blame each other]. Clearly it's a misunderstanding, Gueye is trying to play the ball but it's that reaction here, that slap, open hand.",
      "\"We've been talking about it many times. I think the referee has no other choice. When you see it there, the law tells you any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",

However, Cunha has also picked up an injury and has not made the matchday squad.",

We have to show everybody, when you are not 100 per cent, we have a different player to cope with the demands of the game.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee comes into the starting XI in place of Cunha. Zirkzee has not started a league game since April and was last on the scoresheet in the league against tonight's opponents back in December. Amorim added on the decision to start Zirkzee: \"I just want to see Josh playing well, with the quality he has.",
      "\"We have a problem with Ben [Sesko] and we have a problem with Cunha. He's working in that position. If you look at our team, I think Josh has, more or less, the same characteristics as Cunha in that position. We want to maintain what we worked with during the week and he is ready.\"",
      "United could move up to fourth with a win against Everton tonight. They head into the clash in tenth position in the table but could be just one point and one place behind Manchester City come the close of play.",

      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",

      "Nobody would have believed this statement at the start of the season, but Luke Shaw can be classed as one of the best players of the season so for Manchester United. Ignoring the Manchester City defeat, where nobody covered themselves in glory, Shaw has been a dependable option for Ruben Amorim.",
      "His reliability has been missing in recent years. In the 2024/25 season, he missed 294 days due to three injuries. The season prior it was 239 days and there were question marks over whether he would stay fit long enough to contribute to the cause.",
      "And yet, his redemption arc has been spectacular in the 2025/26 campaign. He has started every single Premier League fixture for Amorim and is settled on the left of the back three in Lisandro Martinez's absence.",
      "None of this could have been expected at the end of last season but it is a credit to the medical team and Shaw that he has managed to become a regular again. However, this could all unravel if Amorim goes with the idea he floated in his pre-Everton press conference when asked whether Shaw could play at left wing-back.",
      "\"He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.\" In a way, you can see why Amorim would come to that conclusion.",
      "Naturally, Shaw is a full-back but he has suffered a lot of injuries since last playing on the flank. He has had to adapt his style of play and is impressing in the less physically demanding role of left centre-back.",
      "Amorim said it himself in his press conference, the load a player at wing-back has to take on is much more than what he is doing now and would stretch Shaw's body to the maximum, increasing the chances of an injury.",
      "Even if United were confident Shaw has overcome past issues, now is not the time to trial him at wing back. United are about to enter their busiest period of the campaign and it would be asking for trouble to shift Shaw out wide.",

      "“Very impressed, very impressed, and sometimes even a little bit surprised,\" said Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber about Manchester United loanee Radek Vitek last month. \"He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "The general rule with United loans is that they send players with a genuine chance of contributing to the first team at Old Trafford on loan to the Championship. Vitek and Toby Collyer are currently playing in the division. Alvaro Fernandez and Amad were success stories at Preston and Sunderland respectively.",
      "The Championship is an unforgiving 46-game campaign, and young players must demonstrate resilience and quality to be successful in the division.",
      "Vitek has shown a lot of quality since he signed for Bristol City on a season-long loan. The goalkeeper has started every league game, kept five clean sheets and has won huge praise from their fans.",
      "He made the perfect first impression after signing on loan, saving a penalty in Bristol City's final pre-season game, and has not looked back.",
      "\"Of course, signing a player from Manchester United always brings with it a sense of excitement, but the 22-year-old was certainly an unknown quantity when he arrived.",
      "\"A penalty save and clean sheet in his first, and only, friendly for the Robins against Real Valladolid impressed those in attendance, and Vitek has only improved from that point on.",
      "\"His opening day display away to Sheffield United was superb as he commanded his penalty area brilliantly and pulled off a handful of smart stops from a variety of different scenarios.",
      "\"While you would expect a young goalkeeper to potentially be a bit of a rabbit in the headlights in what is an incredibly physical Championship this season, Vitek has looked like a veteran stopper in England’s second tier.\"",
      "He continued: \"Barring one uncharacteristic error in the 5-1 defeat to Stoke City, Vitek has been brilliant. It isn’t an exaggeration to suggest he has single-handedly won points on several occasions.",
      "\"He has produced multiple match-deciding stops at crucial points of matches. Vitek has kept five clean sheets over the course of his first 15 matches in red and white, and you could argue he deserves more.",
      "\"Against the likes of Charlton, Norwich City, Birmingham City and Hull City, it was his work between the posts as much as that of the attackers at the other end of the pitch that proved to be the difference, with his showing against the Addicks in particular a real standout.",
      "\"The fans have taken to him, as displayed by his interactions with away ends. The fact that he has kept Max O’Leary out of the team - the goalkeeper who played all 46 matches last season as the Reds ended their 17-year wait for a top six finish - speaks volumes to just how impressed Struber has been so far.\"",
      "Vitek cut his teeth on loan with Accrington Stanley in the second half of 2023/24. He joined the League Two club in the winter window and made 18 starts in the league, helping to guide them to safety.",
      "When Vitek reported for pre-season at Carrington after that loan, he started in a United friendly against Rosenborg in Norway and delivered a man-of-the-match performance.",
      "He told MUTV: \"It's really good for youngsters to get the opportunity, but when you step on the field you have to show yourself because it's a big chance in front of a lot of people.\"",
      "When asked about what it was like to represent United in pre-season, Vitek smiled and added: \"It's an amazing feeling, the fans are absolutely amazing and it was a full stadium of red shirts.\"",
      "Vitek was named in the 29-man travelling squad for the United States tour, but he was sent on a season-long loan to Austrian club FC Blau-Weiß Linz after returning to Manchester.",
      "During his unveiling, FC Blau-Weiß Linz's sporting director said: \"With Radek, we are getting a very talented young goalkeeper who has already gained a lot of experience in England and is, among other things, part of the goalkeeping team of Manchester United's first team.\"",
      "Vitek started almost every league game for FC Blau-Weiß Linz, only missing three matches due to an injury. His loan was a resounding success and FC Blau-Weiß Linz wanted to re-sign him on loan this summer.",
      "Speaking in June, United academy goalkeeper coach Tommy Lee said: “Radek has done great in Austria. He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well.",
      "\"He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers. He is a player who maximises every part of the programme to ensure he is the best he can possibly be. Nutrition, gym, analysis. He is the consummate professional.",
      "\"That is going to take him, I believe, to the top level. He is a talented boy and that needs to be said. He’s 6ft 6ins, which always helps. For the other lads, their challenge is to be as good as Radek and do everything he does and more. He is a great example of someone who does that.\"",
      "Bristol City was chosen as the best destination for Vitek to take the next step in his career, and he signed a new contract with United, expiring in 2028, before moving south to Ashton Gate for this season.",
      "Carter explained: \"United fans will have likely seen the clip of the ridiculous save Radek Vitek made to deny Oli McBurnie from close range in City’s win over Hull City back in October.",
      "\"He got down well to claw a low header off the line and away from danger, a stop you wouldn’t imagine someone his size could make, and it was just one of multiple key saves in that contest.",
      "\"His intervention to deny Norwich City’s Jack Stacey at Carrow Road may have been even better, however. Stacey had peeled into space in the centre of the penalty area and wrapped his foot around a cut-back to fire a shot towards the bottom right corner.",
      "\"Despite having an obscured view, Vitek took off to his left and got down well to not only get a big hand on the bouncing shot but also push it into the path of Neto Borges, who could hack clear.",
      "\"Struber said after that win at Carrow Road that even he was surprised at times by just what Vitek was capable of. I am probably forgetting other impressive saves, but the fact that there are quite so many to pick from is a testament to just how good Vitek has been during his loan.\"",
      "Discussing Vitek's strengths and weaknesses, Carter said: \"He is a really good shot-stopper. Whether it be when reacting to close-range efforts or when dealing with looping shots from range, he seems to have the answer more often than not.",
      "\"If you were to look back at the goals he has conceded so far this season, you’d do well to suggest he could have done much better with all but a handful of them.",
      "\"When it comes to commanding his box, he uses every inch of his frame to deal well with high balls, whether that be from open play or set-pieces. It has been clear this season just how much more comfortable Bristol City have been when defending corners, and a large part of that has been their goalkeeper’s willingness to leave his line and deal with looping balls.",
      "\"It is challenging to identify a major weakness, but I think you could make a compelling argument that distribution is Vitek’s primary area for improvement.",
      "\"He can kick the ball further than most goalkeepers I’ve seen at Ashton Gate, and he has pulled off a couple of smart - if concerning - Cruyff turns, but he has probably kicked goal kicks into touch a bit too often. He is by no means terrible with the ball at his feet, but he could be a bit more polished.\"",
      "When asked whether Vitek could play in the Premier League, he added: \"Absolutely. Bristol City have signed several players on loan from Premier League clubs over the years, and although it is still early days, Radek Vitek has been one of the most impressive.",
      "\"Vitek has been one of the division’s best shot stoppers and he is excellent when it comes to commanding his box. Naturally, given his age and lack of top-flight experience, he has room to improve, but you would struggle to find a Bristol City fan who wasn’t confident that Vitek will play in the Premier League.",
      "\"Of course, it will depend on what Manchester United plan to do with him come the end of his time at Ashton Gate, but I would imagine his performances will have caught the eye of some Premier League sides.",
      "\"Whether it be at Old Trafford, another club, or hopefully, in another loan spell with the Robins after helping them win promotion this term, I’d expect Vitek to be playing top-flight football next season.\"",
      "\"It was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year. It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive. I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek continued: \"I'm still quite young, but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing. The first game away from home... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget it.\"",
      "He went on to discuss his hopes of playing for United. \"I'm taking it step-by-step and we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" he said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek has huge potential and could challenge Senne Lammens for the No.1 spot next season.",

      "Former Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has issued the perfect response to ex-teammate Paul Pogba's emotional statement. That's following the midfielder's long-awaited comeback to football.",
      "Pogba, 32, has had two spells with United throughout his career, initially as a youth prospect before he re-joined the club in 2016 from Juventus for a then world-record fee. Rashford, meanwhile, is a product of United's academy - although he's currently out on loan with La Liga giants Barcelona.",
      "Pogba departed Old Trafford for the final time in 2022 following the expiration of his contract and returned to Juventus as a free agent. However, in his second season back in Turin, he was hit with a shock doping ban.",
      "The Frenchman was handed a provisional four-year suspension from football back in February 2024 after testing positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a result stemming from a sample taken the previous August. Pogba has always insisted it was a mistake and he had been given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.",
      "His suspension was eventually reduced - and he was cleared to return to football in March this year. He became a free agent when his contract with Juventus was mutually terminated at the end of 2024, and he joined Ligue 1 side AS Monaco in June.",
      "Pogba has been forced to wait to return to the pitch, however, due to the need to rebuild fitness. He finally made his debut this weekend as he came on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 defeat away at Rennes.",
      "Speaking on Instagram on Sunday, Pogba said: \"Last night was unforgettable. Stepping back on to the pitch after two years away meant more to me than I can express.",
      "\"To the fans, thank you for the love, the energy, and the belief. To everyone who stood behind me, supported me, and pushed me through every moment of this journey, I'm deeply grateful.",
      "\"This debut wasn't just mine... it belonged to all of you who never stopped supporting me.\"",
      "A handful of his former United teammates have showed their support in the comments of the post. Rashford was among them, leaving a simple red heart emoji.",
      "Current United captain Bruno Fernandes also echoed the sentiment - from his previous Instagram story - with the comment \"Pogback,\" while Jesse Lingard replied: \"The boy'ss back.\"",
      "Pogba came on as a late substitute in the 85th-minute, although the match was all but lost for Monaco at that stage as they trailed 4-0, with a late consolation making it 4-1 in added time. This week, however, the midfielder will hope to rack up more minutes with a crucial Champions League match against Pafos.",
      "That's followed by a trip to face French giants Paris Saint-Germain next weekend.",

      "Manchester United return to Premier League action on Monday evening following the final international break of the year.",
      "The Reds have enjoyed a far more promising start to the season compared to last year, with five wins from their 11 league matches so far. They currently sit tenth in the standings, but a win over Everton on Monday would take them into the top five, and potentially into fourth depending on the scoreline.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim has still had to navigate a handful of injury concerns, including one to summer striker signing Benjamin Sesko. That said, United currently have a relatively modest injury list compared to some of their league rivals.",
      "Here, MEN Sport takes a look at United's current fitness concerns and when those players can expect to return to action...",
      "United's summer striker signing Sesko has been sidelined since before the international break, when he was forced off with a knee injury against Tottenham. As a result, he didn’t join up with the Slovenian national team for their World Cup qualifiers against Sweden and Kosovo.",
      "It does not appear a return is imminent either, as Amorim confirmed in his pre-Everton press conference that the 22-year-old is not quite ready to come back. \"He is going to stay a few weeks out,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"I don't know how long but it is not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover. He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back.\"",
      "Potential return date: Wolves (A) - December 8.",
      "Another of United's summer signings, Matheus Cunha, is also a surprise doubt for the Everton clash after he was forced to pull out of a Christmas lights switch-on in Altrincham over the weekend. The Brazilian was due to attend the event on Saturday night, but “medical reasons” were cited as the reason for his absence.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons,\" VisitAltrincham wrote in a statement.",
      "It remains unclear how serious the issue is or whether he will feature against the Toffees.",
      "Potential return date: Unknown.",
      "Midfielder Kobbie Mainoo faces a late fitness test ahead of the meeting at Old Trafford. Amorim revealed in his press conference late last week that he hadn’t trained, but could still return in time for Everton.",
      "\"Kobbie didn't train today, but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie, so we will see,\" the manager explained.",
      "Potential return date: Everton (H) – November 24.",
      "Defender Harry Maguire also picked up a muscular injury in the draw with Tottenham prior to the international break. He was forced off shortly after the 70th minute and replaced by Leny Yoro.",
      "Amorim confirmed last week that the England international will not be ready for the visit of Everton and it is currently unclear when he will return.",
      "Potential return date: Unknown.",
      "United's long-term absentee is defender Lisandro Martinez, who sustained an ACL injury back in February. After nine months on the sidelines, he is understood to be closing in on a return, having been building up his fitness after a prolonged period out.",
      "\"I feel that Licha is becoming close to being ready to play,\" the United boss revealed last week. \"Of course, we need to be careful, he's going to struggle in the first minutes, but he's clearly in a better position when you compare two weeks ago.\"",
      "Potential return date: November 2025",

      "The 32-year-old spent several years at United across two spells, having initially joined the club aged 16. He departed for Juventus as a free agent in 2012, but returned for a then world-record fee in 2016.",
      "He amassed over 230 appearances across all competitions during that time - scoring 39 goals and registering 51 assists. Pogba then rejoined Juventus in 2022 at the end of his contract, but made his last competitive outing for the Serie A club in September 2023.",
      "The Frenchman was handed a provisional four-year ban from football in February 2024 after testing positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a result that came from a sample taken the previous August. Pogba has always insisted it was a mistake and he had been given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.",
      "His ban was eventually reduced and he was permitted to return to football in March this year. He was without a club after his contract with Juventus was terminated by mutual agreement towards the end of 2024.",
      "Pogba returned to France to join Ligue 1 side Monaco on a free transfer in June, but had to wait to make his debut as he needed to rebuild his fitness after such a long absence. On Saturday, he came off the bench in their 4-1 defeat to Rennes, marking his first appearance in more than two years.",
      "Members of the current United squad, including captain Bruno Fernandes, took to social media to congratulate Pogba on his return. The Portuguese playmaker shared a post on his Instagram story of Pogba - followed by the caption: \"Pogbaaaaaack.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford during the summer transfer window just gone, also posted on Instagram. He re-shared a clip from Monaco's official account showing Pogba coming on as a substitute, followed by a holding-back-tears emoji and heart emojis.",
      "It was not the exact return Pogba would have wanted as his side succumbed to a 4-1 loss, although they were already four behind and a man down when he took to the pitch - in the 85th minute. The result leaves Monaco eighth in the Ligue 1 standings, level on points with Lille, who have a game-in-hand.",
      "With minutes now under his belt, Pogba will no doubt hope to play a role in some huge games coming up for the French side over the next week. They first meet Pafos away in the Champions League on Wednesday night, which will be followed by the visit of Paris Saint-Germain next weekend.",
      "United, meanwhile, return to action on Monday night with a test against Everton in the Premier League. Next weekend, they will take on Crystal Palace away from home.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been left sweating this weekend over the fitness of Matheus Cunha ahead of the Premier League return vs Everton on Monday night. On Friday, the Portuguese head coach confirmed Benjamin Sesko would miss the next few weeks due to a knee injury suffered in the draw at Tottenham.",
      "However, a statement from an unlikely source has subsequently cast doubt over the fitness of Cunha. On Saturday evening, the Brazilian was due to switch the Christmas lights on in Altrincham but the organisers announced the forward had been forced to pull out.",
      "In a statement, VisitAltrincham confirmed: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight’s Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "So far, there has been no indication from United as to how bad the issue is. If Cunha is to miss the Reds' clash with Everton on Monday night, this leaves Amorim with plenty to think about in regards his team selection. Missing two players who the United boss has tended to favour in attack could lead to an interesting forward line.",
      "From new roles to a fringe player returning to the fore, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could line-up if Cunha is missing on Monday night against Everton and beyond.",
      "United were always likely to deploy the false nine system on Monday night due to Sesko's absence. Ordinarily in the strikerless formation, Cunha would sit at the top of the attack but if he is not fit, that role could be given to Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Playing as a centre-forward is a position which Mbeumo knows fairly well from his time at Brentford. In his last four appearances leading the attack for the Bees in the Premier League, he scored four goals so he clearly knows how to play the role.",
      "If the Reds were to start Mbeumo in the advanced role, Mason Mount and Amad are the ones most likely to feature behind him. Mount did well in his cameo role at Spurs and while the Ivorian has become more dangerous in the wider role, he can still impact the game positively from the No.10 position.",
      "There is a consensus that Joshua Zirkzee's time at Old Trafford is coming to an end. The Dutchman has played just 90 minutes over five sub appearances for the Reds and we can expect Zirkzee to request an exit in January as he launches a last gasp bid for a World Cup spot.",
      "Earlier this week, when it became clear Sesko would be out, there was a feeling Zirkzee was about to discover his position at the club. Amorim favours a centre forward unless facing a team who are more likely to attack than sit back; so to choose the strikerless system would be to confirm the Dutchman is not in his plans.",
      "Now Cunha could be out too and should Zirkzee be overlooked it would only further confirm his slipping position at Old Trafford. Were he to return, we could expect him to lead the line with Mbeumo and Amad in behind. On paper, this would be a good option but evidence suggests this will not be the route Amorim takes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo missed Friday's training session but Amorim was hopeful he could return to play a role vs Everton. Mainoo's role so far this season has been from the bench but with Cunha potentially absent he could be recalled.",
      "Slotting in alongside Casemiro, Mainoo would then allow Bruno Fernandes to move further forward. It is clear the captain would prefer to play more advanced if the choice was given to him.",
      "Alongside Amad, you could then keep Mbeumo in the false nine position. This would provide United with a strong attacking threat and plenty of creativity in the final third.",

      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "On whether the performance surprised him after a good run of form, Amorim added: “Of course it did.

      "It wasn’t Graeme Le Saux vs David Batty and frankly pathetic in comparison to the shirt-ripping majesty of Kieron Dyer vs Lee Bowyer, which meant that rather than being treated to a joyous “they’re having a fight?!” line on commentary, everyone but referee Tony Harrington was initially confused as to exactly why Idrissa Gueye had been given his marching orders at Old Trafford.",
      "We’re absolutely here for a footballer being sent off for slapping one of their own teammates. It’s far more gratifying than them striking a member of the opposition, not least in this instance because we were treated to David Moyes’ wonderful post-match revelation that “I actually like my players fighting”. Lovely stuff.",
      "It’s a weird rule though. Gueye wouldn’t have been sent off for an accidental studs-up challenge over the ball on Keane, for example. Nor for denying him a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "It felt like a crushing blow at the time for Everton, who had been very, very comfortable up to that point in the 13th minute against a Manchester United side who had offered little but have looked like a semi-serious football team for the last couple of months.",
      "An attacking midfielder finding space behind the United double-pivot, taking advantage of some weak defending and then scoring past a limp-wristed goalkeeper who failed to get off the ground is vintage pre-October 2025 Manchester United.",
      "Quite how Everton, a side hardly famed for their ability to pop the ball around with 11 men, albeit with an uptick in possession this season under Moyes, were able to open up that space for and find Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall without a Manchester United player getting anywhere near any of them in the build-up was again, classic rock-bottom stuff from the Red Devils.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was weak, Leny Yoro weaker still and goalkeeper extraordinaire Senne Lammens got his timing all wrong to make what was a half-decent turn, touch and shot from Dewsbury-Hall look like the work of a world-class playmaker.",
      "And it had been coming. Not because of any sort of barrage on Lammens’ goal from the visitors, but because United afforded them absurdly easy possession, sleeping through 15 minutes after Gueye’s dismissal. After which, significantly, David Moyes didn’t feel the need to sacrifice one of his forwards to replace one of the Premier League’s foremost midfield destroyers, such was the lack of threat from the home side.",
      "An increase in Manchester United pressure in the second half came mainly in the form of delivering crosses towards two Everton centre-backs famously accomplished at dealing with balls in the air and two or three United players, whom Gary Neville listed one after the other with a “can’t head it” suffix.",
      "Without Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury, Amorim turned to Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Diogo Dalot to change the game in United’s favour. But he steadfastly refused to even tweak his much-maligned system, to Neville’s bemusement.",
      "“Still didn’t win the first ball, or the second – embarrassing,” Neville said as Thierno Barry set the season-record for aerial balls won (14) from a Jordan Pickford long ball as United lined up with their customary five in defence. But the majority of the co-commentator’s wrath was reserved for Luke Shaw.",
      "He’s got one pace, summed up by Neville when he spotted him “ambling forward” from left centre-back, rather than bombing on as you might expect when marking no-one for 80 minutes of a game of football. “What he’s doing is a waste of time,” Neville added of a footballer who did once, admittedly a while ago, get to the byline and deliver crosses.",
      "Yoro has never been that guy and that was made very clear by his staunch refusal to cross the ball from the inside right position on any of the 427 occasions he was handed the opportunity.",
      "Pickford produced one sublime save to deny Joshua Zirkzee, who fluffed another couple of headers, and Bruno Fernandes missed a clearcut chance for United. But while it felt frantic, that energy came from United, not Everton, whose defenders dealt expertly with the balls into the box as Dewsbury-Hall, Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye worked tirelessly to drag them up the pitch, win free-kicks and relieve pressure whenever possible.",
      "A brilliant performance from Everton and a significant reality check for Amorim, whose greatest concern will be how easily his Manchester United side reverted to their 2025 norm, while very familiar frustrations over the manager’s refusal to adjust his system no matter the circumstances will rear their ugly but entirely reasonable heads in the aftermath.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told wantaway players that “Manchester United comes first” but is retaining those players actually in the club’s best interests? Particularly if, as Amorim himself insists, “it’s impossible to manage a dressing room like that”.",
      "In a World Cup year both Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are very keen on loan moves in January. Mainoo is yet to start, making seven substitute appearances in the Premier League; Zirkzee has featured for just 82 minutes.",
      "Asked about their futures ahead of Monday night’s clash, Amorim was adamant that he wouldn’t consider their exits if it would hinder Manchester United.",

      "“I want my players to be happy. I understand the frustration of some players, seeing that the World Cup is there, and I know what it means for the World Cup, but Manchester United comes first. So if I can help the club and the players, I will be happy, if not I have to think about the team.”",
      "It’s up for debate whether Manchester United players who are not playing football is what’s best for the club, not least because their values will be plummeting ahead of next summer if – as looks very likely to be the case – they’re set to be sold as ill-fitting parts in Amorim’s system.",
      "And quite why Amorim has one rule for Rasmus Hojlund and an entirely different one in the cases of Mainoo and Zirkzee is unclear.",
      "Asked if the club made a mistake in allowing Hojlund to leave the club in the summer on the back of Benjamin Sesko’s injury, Amorim insisted him staying would have made the dressing room “impossible to manage”.",
      "He added: “Imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say: ‘If Ben has an injury, you have more time to play’. It’s impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that’s why we need to improve the kids from academy.",
      "“If you have an injury that is the opportunity for them, and then to have players that can play in different positions, for us to manage the team in a better way.”",
      "Amorim also claimed Chido Obi was promoted “too soon” last season and the 17-year-old wasn’t named in the squad on Monday despite the injuries to Sesko, and Matheus Cunha, whose absence was all but confirmed by Visit Altrincham’s superb bombshell press release on Saturday evening.",
      "“Unfortunately Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight’s Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.”",
      "United are two forwards down, as they will be again next month when Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo both leave for AFCON. And while Zirkzee and Mainoo’s game time has been limited in a season bereft of football owing to them not competing in Europe and being dumped out of the League Cup by Grimsby Town, the first real injury problem for United sees Zirkzee in the starting lineup.",
      "Given Amorim’s preference for using Mainoo further forward, the academy graduate will hope that no Mbuemo or Amad, and maybe others through injury, will see him play his part in the busy winter weeks, and perhaps stake his claim for more regular game time when they return.",
      "Whether or not that is the case, Amorim is absolutely right not to let these players leave the club, even if it is giving him an “impossible” dressing room to manage. Others do it relatively easily, mate.",

      "Semenyo, 25, is set to be at the epicentre of a Premier League bidding frenzy. The 25-year-old, whose explosive start to the 2025-26 season has yielded six Premier League goals – trailing only Erling Haaland (14), Igor Thiago (9) and Danny Welbeck (7) – is the subject of serious interest, with approaches ‘imminent’, per sources.",

      "With Richarlison one goal behind Semenyo’s tally, insiders say Spurs are READY to match the £65million release clause in Semenyo’s contract, which activates in January but expires on a fixed date, allowing Bournemouth time to sign replacements.",
      "This clause, down from a £70million summer valuation, represents a bargain for a player whose counter-attacking prowess has terrorised defences.",
      "However, TEAMtalk understands that United’s interest has intensified, bolstered by an unlikely ally: Bournemouth technical director Simon Francis, a lifelong Red Devil.",

      "Arne Slot sees him as an upgrade and fresh energy in a struggling squad, fitting seamlessly into his high-pressing blueprint.",

      "Bournemouth, buoyed by sales of Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi without derailing progress, reluctantly brace for departure.",
      "Semenyo, content yet ambitious, hasn’t pushed for a move but welcomes elite suitors.",
      "Bristol City are also set to pocket 20 per cent of profits following his £10m move in 2023, so the Championship club will benefit financially when he moves.",

      "In other news, respected journalist Fabrizio Romano has confirmed United have performed a U-turn on Casemiro and now want the legendary Brazilian to sign a new contract.",
      "However, this will only happen if the 33-year-old agrees to reduced terms, with his current salary standing at a whopping £350,000 per week. His current deal expires next summer.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘close’ to completing a January transfer as they look to sign a new centre-midfielder.",
      "The Red Devils have been active in the transfer market over the past few months, with club chiefs sanctioning a significant squad overhaul after last season’s 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "It was recognised that change was needed to get Man Utd back on track and to give head coach Ruben Amorim a better chance of thriving.",
      "Man Utd had a limited budget in the summer, but they raised money through several high-profile exits, with these deals allowing the club to spend around £230m as one of the window’s biggest spenders to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "Each of these signings have made a positive impact in recent months as results and performances have improved. The Red Devils are currently five games unbeaten in the Premier League and can boost their Champions League hopes by beating Everton on Monday night.",

      "United were priced out of a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer, but he remains an option with Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "Wolves star Joao Gomes has also been mentioned and he is a far cheaper alternative, with a report from Trivela claiming a 50 million euro (£44m) move to Man Utd is ‘close’.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Talks between United and Wolves have progressed in recent days. There is even an expectation that the transfer will take place in the next transfer window, which begins in January.’",
      "Journalist Dean Jones has since informed our pals at TEAMtalk that Gomes to Man Utd has moved ‘one step closer’ as he has ‘said yes’ to a transfer and has had his ‘head turned’ by the Premier League giants.",
      "Man Utd’s next midfield signing could end up competing with a resurgent Casemiro, with Fabrizio Romano reporting that he will remain at the club beyond the end of this season and the expiry of his contract on one condition.",
      "“So now the desire is, from United obviously, to continue with Casemiro but on different conditions,” Romano said on his YouTube channel",
      "“The salary he has right now is a salary that Man Utd don’t want to pay in the future. Not because of Casemiro or Maguire, but because they want to change the salary structure.",
      "“So at the moment, for Casemiro, the only way to stay would be a different contract, a different salary. Otherwise, he could be free next summer to go wherever he wants.",
      "“He always had a lot of interest, especially from Saudi Arabia. So, after his excellent performances recently, Casemiro obviously will have many clubs interested.",
      "“At the moment that’s the situation with Casemiro. Nothing is guaranteed in terms of a new contract because of the salary, so either they find a solution on the salary structure together otherwise Casemiro could be leaving Man Utd in summer 2026.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Arsenal are “not considering an exit” for Myles Lewis-Skelly in the winter transfer market.",

      "Arsenal are still hot favourites despite conceding a couple of actual goals at Sunderland, while the silliness literally everywhere else sees Tottenham in the top six despite having five points from six games at home, and newly promoted Sunderland sat looking down on three of the Big Six a quarter of the way through the season, just like everyone predicted.",
      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche, and it all leaves Daniel Farke under the harshest glare of the Sack Race spotlight.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now six wins in seven Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top six after 12 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and that becaome three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a ferociously mediocre Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "It is still early days and still too early to tell which way a vaguely-promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs. But it’s starting to look likelier it breaks the wrong way for the manager.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth leave things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "A simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after a run of three straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. And it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up in what’s shaping up to be a really bad season to lose your mid-table mojo.",
      "Still think both club and manager would live to regret parting ways, but it’s a dicey time.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, with Man City and Chelsea next before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "Ruben Amorim says his Man Utd players’ “understanding of every situation in the game was not there” in defeat to Everton on Monday.",
      "Jamie Carragher says he’s never seen another manager do what Ruben Amorim’s doing at Man Utd and insists he deserves “a lot of blame” for the defeat to Everton.",
      "A porous midfield, weak defending, questionable goalkeeping, predictable and repetitive attacking patterns, toothless forwards and 3-4-2-1 doubts. Welcome back, Manchester United.",

      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "It has been argued that Liverpool may soon have no choice but to sack Arne Slot, while Jurgen Klopp has been backed to make a return to management.",
      "Thomas Frank lands in the losers alongside Arne Slot after his embarrassing five-word admission after defeat to the really quite ridiculously good Arsenal.",
      "The actual Premier League standings are damning enough on Liverpool, but these five tables highlight why the champions find themselves in the bottom half…",
      "Pep Guardiola said ‘now the real season starts’ for Manchester City before Newcastle – and it might already be over as Arsenal capitalised on their defeat.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has hatched a plan to ‘drop’ Ibrahima Konate from his starting XI for PSV on Wednesday night.",
      "Is it time to ask whether Alexander Isak is the biggest flop in Premier League history? It’s been a perfect storm of crud for Liverpool’s big-money signing."

Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half. There was no sign of him adding to that total v Liverpool but he did score v Nottingham Forest and Burnley.",

      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",

      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer.

      "Poor old Sancho, 25, has never made his mark at Manchester United since joining from Borussia Dortmund in a €100m move in 2021, despite having had the chance to impress three permanent managers in that time.",
      "That has led United to send Sancho out on three different loan spells, first back to Dortmund, then to Chelsea, and now Aston Villa.",
      "Sancho’s contract at United is set to expire at the end of the season, which makes it likely he has already played his last game for the club.",
      "But what the future holds for Sancho after that remains a mystery, with his contract at United potentially putting him in a difficult spot next summer.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED TRANSFER GUFF ON F365\n👉 Man Utd transfer ‘not going to happen in January’ as another deal is rated as a ‘maybe’\n👉 Record-breaking Man Utd transfer in tatters as Real Madrid star’s new contract is ‘already closed’\n👉 Man Utd ‘confident’ of striking cut-price transfer for England international",
      "Caught Offside write that Dortmund are keen to give Sancho a third spell at the club, but not so keen that they are willing to pay the winger anything like the kind of money he is said to be on at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho is reported to be on wages of £300,000 per week – twice the figure that Dortmund would be willing to pay him.",
      "The far greater riches available to Premier League clubs, and especially a massive club like Manchester United, enable them to pay significantly more than Dortmund would reasonably be able to offer.",
      "The Bundesliga side are also said to be unwilling to make an exception and break their wage structure to re-secure Sancho’s signature. That would leave Sancho either needing to take a biiiig old 50% pay cut.",
      "Giving up nearly £8m a year would be a major blow to Sancho’s wallet, of course, though we’re sure sympathy for his position will rightly be somewhat limited given he would, in fact, still be earning nearly £8m a year.",
      "There’s also the fact that, let’s face it, Sancho’s stock is considerably lower now than it was  when he signed that lucrative contract at United, so he may well not get a better offer than whatever Dortmund put on the table.",
      "After his thoroughly underwhelming spell at Chelsea last season, Sancho has still not really got going at Aston Villa. He is yet to make a start in the Premier League, with Unai Emery only opting to name him in the first XI in the Europa League and the League Cup.",
      "Solskjaer says a poorly ear was to blame for Sancho’s struggles under him at Man Utd but can’t put his finger on why Rashford “didn’t enjoy himself” at Old Trafford.",
      "An insider has revealed the thoughts of Manchester United on Jadon Sancho, who is on loan with Aston Villa, with the final opportunity for his sale approaching.",
      "Estevao is a £104m player who can raise the energy of a home crowd like no other in the Premier League. He is not “doing the same thing” as Sancho.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "The Premier League clubs have voted in favour of squad cost ratio (SCR) replacing profit and sustainability rules (PSR) as the new system of financial fair play and the latest financial results reveal the three clubs which would be facing sanctions had it already been in place.",
      "The new rules will limit the amount of revenue a club can spend on player and manager wages, transfers and agents’ fees to 85%. Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds voted against the change, but the minimum of 14 clubs was reached.",
      "Both Chelsea and Aston Villa were handed heavy fines by UEFA for the 2024/2025 campaign for breaching their SCR limit, which was at that stage 80% and is now set at just 70%. That far stricter level means a club competing in Europe next season could be sanctioned by UEFA but be compliant in the Premier League.",
      "Any team above the 85% mark in the Premier League – the Green Threshold –will face a fine, though they’ve provided significant wiggle room to avoid sporting sanctions, with a multi-year rolling allowance of 30% permitting clubs to spend beyond the limit.",
      "The Red Threshold is 85% plus the allowance; any club beyond that threshold will be given a six-point deduction plus another point for every £6.5m over that mark.",
      "It means that any Premier League club can have a squad cost at 115% of their revenue and avoid a points deduction, though those percentages will change for 2027/2028 and the seasons after that if some of the allowance has already been used.",
      "If, for example, a club spends 95% on their squad next season, they’ve used 10% of their allowance and can therefore spend 105% on their squad the season after, using the remaining 20% of their allowance, without sporting sanction. Got it? Great.",
      "Anyway, here are the revenues and squad costs of the 18 current Premier League teams who were also competing in the 2023/2024 season, the latest financial results available from Deloitte, ranked from lowest to highest squad cost/revenue ratio, which shows the three clubs that were above the new Green Threshold.",

      "Brus had heard that a £70m fee ‘might be realistic’ but now sources have told him that Man Utd are hopeful of at least opening talks for even less.",
      "One source told Brus: “Financially, the situation is complex.",

So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",

      "Amid talk of a sensational return to Old Trafford for Scott McTominay, Gary Lineker has handed Manchester United an excuse they don’t deserve for selling him in the first place.",

      "Recent reports claiming United are interested in bringing the 28-year-old back to the club have ramped up on the back of his extraordinary overhead kick to help Scotland beat Denmark and secure their place at the World Cup.",
      "FIFA’s showcase competition is inarguably the stage for a man whose stratospheric rise since Napoli paid just £25.4m to secure his signing from United in August 2024 saw him finish 18th in the Ballon d’Or just over a year later.",
      "To suggest he would even have been in the minds of the voting journalists in his time at United would have been laughable, and the decision-makers at Old Trafford in no way merit the sympathy being afforded to them by Lineker on The Rest Is Football.",
      "“What a spell he’s having in his career. You know, he goes from Manchester United, probably his club that he played for since a boy.",
      "“And then he was probably, I mean, surely they must have seen the talent that he had?",
      "“But I suspect he was sold because of the PSR rules and you get, you know, a bigger advantage because he’s a homegrown lad, which strikes me as absolutely wrong.”",
      "Former United boss Erik ten Hag did indeed blame the perverse PSR rules when asked why McTominay was sold.",
      "“Selling a graduate is considered 100 per cent profit under current PSR rules and United sorely needed the cash. Unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",

      "We accept that United probably wouldn’t have sold McTominay for £25.4m if those rules didn’t exist. What we take issue with is Lineker’s claim that United in any way “saw the talent he had”.",
      "He was a squad player; no more than a guy who was ‘good to have around’. He started just 18 Premier League games in his final season and in the two campaigns in which he was the first-choice option he was one half of McFred having been inextricably paired with another player deemed not good enough to be starting regularly for the club.",
      "Conte realised his talent immediately. Having operated as a defensive midfielder in a double pivot in over half of his appearances for his boyhood club, at Napoli he’s played as a No.8, No.10 and even on the wing to ensure he can make the difference in the final third, where he’s evidently at his best.",
      "Pure profit or not, selling McTominay for just £25.4m is evidence enough of what United thought of a player who’s now easily worth twice that much.",

      "\"It just smelt of complacency. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance. It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again.",
      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",

      "Monday 24 November 2025 23:15, UK",
      "Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye was sent off for striking team-mate Michael Keane just 13 minutes into the Toffees' remarkable Premier League win at Manchester United.",
      "The incident was sparked when Gueye - who misplaced a loose pass towards Keane in the penalty area to give the ball away - began berating his team-mate.",
      "Gueye then raised his hand to Keane's face before he was sent off for violent conduct by referee Tony Harrington.",
      "Despite his sending off, Everton went on to win 1-0 thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal, and afterwards Gueye apologised to his team-mates in the changing room and released a statement on social media.",
      "He wrote on Instagram: \"I want to apologise first to my team-mate Michael. I take full responsibility for my reaction.",
      "\"I also apologise to my team-mates, the staff, the fans and the club. What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behaviour. I'll make sure it never happens again.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim also disagreed with the red card and criticised his players for not showing enough fight.",
      "He said: \"Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn't mean they don't like each other. Fighting is if you lose the ball, I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling with that red card.",

      "\"How much venom was in that slap?\" said Neville. \"He has been sent off for that. Was it a little slap or a proper whack?",
      "\"There is no doubt a hand comes out to the face but it didn't look too much. They might have had to send him off purely because there is a strike to the face.",
      "\"They were not fighting, it wasn't a scrap. It could have been dealt with by a yellow. I don't think it needed to be a red.\"",
      "Jamie Carragher said at half-time in the Monday Night Football studio: \"I just think: can a referee manage the situation a bit better?",
      "\"Can you get the two of them together and say: 'Hey can you behave yourselves?' Just sort of manage the situation, rather than that's the rulebook.",
      "\"The rulebook gives the referee a bit of an out. He could say: 'I don't think it's over the top' and then you can carry on 11 vs 11.\"",
      "Monday Night Football guest Roberto Martinez, the Portugal head coach, agreed with the red card decision.",
      "The ex-Everton boss said: Clearly, it's a misunderstanding; Gueye is trying to play the ball [to Keane], but it's that reaction, the slap.",
      "\"The referee has no other choice because the law tells you that any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",
      "According to the Premier League rules, striking an opponent or any other person on the head or face with their hand or arm represents violent conduct, unless the force used was negligible.",
      "\"Was it negligible?\" pondered Neville. \"That's the question. I think it was negligible. I don't think there was much in that at all.\"",
      "Gueye is now set to be suspended for Everton's next three games.",
      "The Senegal international became the first Premier League player sent off for striking his own team-mate since Ricardo Fuller for Stoke City against West Ham in 2008.",
      "It is only the third time a player has been sent off for striking a team-mate, after Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer's infamous double-red card in 2005.",
      "Despite Gueye's dismissal, however, Everton ground out a hard-fought 1-0 victory for their first win at Old Trafford since 2013.",
      "Match-winner Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall confirmed after the game that Gueye had apologised to his team-mates for what Dewsbury-Hall described as \"a moment of madness\".",
      "When Bowyer and Dyer clashed in 2005, the former was handed a seven-game ban in total - an initial four games for it being his second red card of the season, before the FA handed an additional three matches to the suspension.",
      "Bowyer was also given a £30,000 fine, with the midfielder then leaving for West Ham in the following summer.",
      "Meanwhile, in 2008, Stoke striker Fuller was sent off for striking his captain Andy Fuller. The striker claimed the situation actually helped team morale. Fuller stayed at Stoke until 2012.",
      "\"It's one of those things. It's done and dusted, and it's made us stronger as a unit,\" Fuller said.",
