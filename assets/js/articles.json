      "Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo finds himself at a career crossroads, with the next two transfer windows potentially being pivotal for him. The 20-year-old midfielder experienced a meteoric rise at Old Trafford after breaking into the first team a few years ago, but his career has now stalled.",
      "Despite an injury-ravaged start to the 2023/24 season, Mainoo managed to secure a spot in the starting line-up under Erik ten Hag, making 24 Premier League appearances that campaign, most of them as a starter.",
      "Injuries once again marred his progress last season, but he still clocked up over 30 appearances across all competitions, even amidst a mid-season managerial change when Ruben Amorim took over from Ten Hag. However, after rumours of a potential move away surfaced towards the end of the summer transfer window, this season has taken a different turn for the England international.",
      "So far this season, Mainoo has only started one match, a Carabao Cup second-round tie against Grimsby Town at the end of August - a match that Amorim's side lost on penalties following a 2-2 draw in regular time.",
      "Mainoo has made appearances in nine out of United's 14 Premier League matches so far, but all have been as a substitute. Most recently, he was an unused substitute in the 1-1 draw at home against West Ham on Thursday evening.",
      "Following Mainoo's latest snub against the Hammers, a furious Paul Scholes took to Instagram to vent his frustration at the Reds head coach. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes posted in response to Amorim, who said last week he views Mainoo as a starter.",
      "\"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Only four senior members of United's squad have yet to make a Premier League start this season. Tom Heaton, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and, most worryingly, Mainoo.",
      "For most on that list, warming the bench is neither unexpected nor alarming. Heaton is third in line for the goalkeeper spot, Malacia was rumoured to be leaving in the summer and was part of the so-called 'bomb squad' with the likes of Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford as they sought transfers, while Martinez has only recently returned from nearly a year out due to a knee injury.",
      "For Mainoo, there's no such justification. So, it's hardly surprising that whispers of a transfer are resurfacing as the January window looms. Mainoo was linked with Napoli in the summer, where his teammate Rasmus Hojlund was loaned out during the same period.",
      "The harsh truth for Mainoo is that his current situation at United seems unlikely to change in the near future, with Amorim simply favouring other players. The club also continues to be associated with potential midfield reinforcements after a move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba fell through in the summer, which would further relegate Mainoo down the pecking order.",
      "In a World Cup year, time is running short, and Mainoo is fast losing chances to work his way back into Thomas Tuchel's thinking. Following his maiden senior England call-up in the spring last year, the midfielder hasn't featured in a Three Lions squad throughout this calendar year.",
      "The England manager was questioned about Mainoo's prospects earlier this season, but predictably pointed to insufficient playing time as the main factor behind his recent exclusions. \"He's lacking minutes,\" Tuchel revealed during a press conference.",
      "\"I don't think he lacks anything else. He has the experience, the power, the quality, the talent to be on our list - he is on our list - but in his position No6, No8, No10 we have players in full rhythm and play key parts in their clubs.\"",
      "Following such a promising start to his United career, it's disappointing that yet another academy product from the club might need to depart to revive his trajectory. While still relatively youthful, Mainoo clearly faces a crucial choice regarding his future in the coming weeks, as he simply cannot continue being sidelined and disregarded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are grappling with a tough decision regarding the future of Kobbie Mainoo. It comes as the midfielder contemplates a potential move in the January transfer window.",
      "The homegrown talent has found game time hard to come by under Ruben Amorim, who has favoured a double pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro this season. Mainoo has clocked up just 261 minutes on the pitch as a result, with only one start coming in the form of the Carabao Cup.",
      "With playing opportunities looking scarce, The Athletic reports that Mainoo is prepared to seek a loan move away from United in the January transfer window due to his frustration over lack of game time.",
      "The report also suggests that the club hasn't made a final decision yet and isn't expected to do so until after AFCON - which falls in the middle of the transfer window - due to the potential impact of players leaving for the tournament.",
      "This sets a timeline for when the academy star could depart, if United decide that an exit in the coming weeks is the best course of action. Mainoo remained on the bench during his team's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening, sparking fresh speculation about his future at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I see it [frustration]. I just want to win,\" Amorim said ahead of Monday's fixture against Wolves when questioned about whether Mainoo might feel disheartened by his selections.",
      "He added: \"I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case, was out, Bruno, he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "While Amorim has stood by his approach regarding Mainoo, United icon Paul Scholes has been far more critical of the manager following his recent remarks. Taking to Instagram, Scholes said: \"Bulls***. The kid's being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Whether Mainoo will be permitted to leave and develop his career elsewhere from January onwards remains uncertain, with significant decisions still pending.",
      "With ongoing speculation surrounding United and a potential midfield signing on the horizon, however, all signs suggest a possible departure for Mainoo.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand has been a household name for decades, having moved into football punditry after his illustrious playing career. The ex-England defender is considered a Premier League legend, winning six league titles before hanging up his boots.",
      "After being part of the broadcaster's coverage for a decade, he decided to leave to follow his other business interests. His final match for TNT was the Champions League final between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, which saw PSG emerge victorious.",
      "\"Since retiring from football, it has been a privilege talking about the game I love for a decade,\" the United icon said as he announced the move on social media. \"I want to acknowledge the tremendous support from the team behind the scenes, whose hard work often goes unseen but has been essential to our success.",
      "Ferdinand has relocated to Dubai alongside his family in a major lifestyle change. The location has become an increasingly attractive haven for British expats, drawn by the sunshine and tax laws.",
      "\"There's not one reason,\" he told The National as he explained why he made the move. \"I went for the Global Soccer Awards at Christmas and I hadn't been there properly for about seven or eight years. We spent time with some of Kate's friends who live there and I just saw a different side to it. I also have a business out there, Football Escapes.\"",
      "He added: \"In Dubai, it feels like they're valued and the lifestyle means that they're happy and vibrant with a good energy for the kids. Lifestyle, safety, weather - it's just a new life.",
      "\"When I made the decision, I thought, 'This must be 30 years when my life has been driven by the fixture list. Not now.' I'm not leaving football, but it's just not the governing body of my life now. I've got to be honest, it feels nice.",
      "\"The education system felt different, felt better for my kids. The children who are coming are 14, which is perfect because it's their two years of GCSEs starting this August. Then we've got a four and a two-year-old, so it's perfect timing for them as well.",
      "\"The curriculum is English curriculum, but it's just done a different way. I feel the teachers in the UK feel a little bit like undervalued, underpaid.\"",
      "Ferdinand's wife, Kate, who he married in 2019, took to social media to share her thoughts on their move to Dubai in August. The former The Only Way is Essex star said: \"A new chapter, a fresh start - because if we don't try, we'll never know.",
      "\"Ahhh! We've talked about this for so long, and now it's finally real... we're here we are making a new home in the place we met!",
      "\"Missing some of our specials already and a bit scared, excited and nervous - but more than anything, ready for fresh starts and new beginnings.\"",
      "Ferdinand is a father to three children from his previous marriage to Rebecca Ellison, who tragically died from cancer a decade ago. Since tying the knot with Kate, Ferdinand and his new wife welcomed their first child together in 2020.",
      "The Richest estimates that Ferdinand's net worth stands at around £57million, accumulated from his football earnings and post-playing income. MoneyInc reports that Ferdinand raked in a salary of £7m per year from his punditry work.",
      "During his playing days, he reportedly earned £6m annually at United, further contributing to his current wealth. While living in the UK, Ferdinand and his family lived in a lavish £4m mansion complete with a swimming pool, gym and expansive dressing room.",
      "The firne defender is also a keen car fan, with the ex-footballer owning an Aston Martin DBS, valued around £225,000. His collection also includes a Porsche Cayenne, worth over £70,000 and a Bentley Continental GT, priced over £180k.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker believes Kobbie Mainoo \"must be furious\" at United boss Ruben Amorim for his lack of game time. Parker, part of the United squads which won the Premier League in 1993 and 1994, feels Mainoo may have to leave unless he gets an indication Amorim trusts him to start.",
      "Mainoo has played less than 200 minutes of league football this season, with each of his nine appearances coming from the bench, harming his hopes of a spot in England's World Cup squad. He was an unused substitute for Thursday's draw with West Ham.",
      "According to The Athletic, United are potentially prepared to sanction a January loan exit and the player is ready to move on. However, the club are said to be keen to wait until after the Africa Cup of Nations ends and Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are assessed following their exertions in Morocco.",
      "\"I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake,\" Parker said. \"He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup.",
      "\"He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned,\" added the ex-England defender, who was speaking to MyBettingSites, added.",
      "“It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at [Scott] McTominay. I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out. It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.”",
      "Mainoo has been linked with a move to Napoli, where McTominay has thrived since leaving Old Trafford. The Serie A holders are looking for reinforcements in midfield after Kevin De Bruyne suffered a long-term injury, and according to the latest reports from The Athletic, Mainoo's frustration at his lack of minutes has led him to conclude a January loan could be best for all parties.",
      "“He [Mainoo] is a player and a person I hope the best for,\" Parker added.\"He is a wonderful young lad, and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",
      "Amorim was asked again about Mainoo in his Friday press conference. “You always ask me the same thing. I understand what you are saying,\" he said. \"You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that does not mean I need to put Kobbie (in the team) when I feel I shouldn’t put Kobbie (in the team).”",
      "When asked if AFCON absences could boost the midfielder's chances of action, he added: \"I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s the same question. I don’t know what is going to happen. It depends. If I see in the training it is the best thing, I will put it. That is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has already made his feelings clear on Mason Mount, despite Roy Keane ’s latest assessment of the midfielder in which he branded him a ‘schoolboy’.",
      "The Red Devils have enjoyed something of an upturn in form this season after a dismal campaign last year. However, recent results have been inconsistent - a defeat to Everton last week, followed by a triumph over Crystal Palace at the weekend, and then a disappointing 1-1 draw at home to West Ham midweek.",
      "Amorim’s side initially took the lead in the first half courtesy of a goal from Diogo Dalot. However, they were unable to see out the win and claim all three points as Soungoutou Magassa found the net for the visitors late on to level the scoreline.",
      "Mount started the game on the bench, but came on to replace Joshua Zirkzee with a little over 10 minutes left to play. Soon after, the Hammers found their equaliser and United did not have it in them to claw back the lead in the closing stages.",
      "Keane, who made a little under 500 appearances for the Red Devils during his playing days, issued a scathing assessment of United’s performance post-match, in which he specifically took aim at Mount. Despite scoring the match winner against Palace at the weekend, the 26-year-old was branded a \"schoolboy\" by Keane on this occasion.",
      "\"When you are trying to see a game off, I look at Mason Mount when he came on, some players take longer to get up to speed but he was like a schoolboy out there. You’re looking for players to come on with presence. If anything they brought the levels down at United. That seemed to be the case tonight.\"",
      "It is likely a sentiment Amorim would strongly disagree with, given he has always been quick to praise Mount - even going back to when he first took the reins in November last year. Right from the outset, during his first fortnight at the helm, Mount’s attitude and determination impressed Amorim.",
      "\"Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid,\" the head coach told club media a little over 12 months ago. “You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Even after injuries hindered Mount’s campaign, in which he missed over 20 games with a hamstring problem, Amorim could not wait to have the midfielder back available for selection again. \"I really love Mason Mount,” the United boss told the media prior to the player's return back in March.",
      "\"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club.\"",
      "The praise did not stop there. Even as recently as the weekend, following United’s win over Palace, Mount showed his true colours as he consoled young defender Leny Yoro after a difficult game. The midfielder may have been the hero on that occasion, but his leadership was on full display at the full-time whistle, something that did not go unnoticed by Amorim.",
      "\"For me, as a manager, it’s really important,\" Amorim explained this week. \"But I take it as normal. If you spend so many hours with one guy, if you have a common goal, if you suffer all together.",
      "\"I think we should support each other because, in the end, we have our friends, we have our club but, in the end, we are the guys who can change everything.\"",
      "United return to action this weekend and will hope to get back to winning ways when they take on a struggling Wolves side at Molineux. Then, the run-up to Christmas will be in full swing with tricky tests against Bournemouth and Aston Villa.",

The second half contained all the game's significant incidents, with Diogo Dalot and Soungoutou Magassa finding the net, while Wan-Bissaka was lucky to escape a dismissal.",
      "United opened the scoring shortly before the hour when Dalot struck home after controlling a mis-hit from Casemiro inside West Ham's penalty area. The away side levelled matters in the 83rd minute when Magassa converted a rebound after Jarrod Bowen's header from a set piece was cleared off the goal line by Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Shortly after the Hammers' equaliser, Wan-Bissaka was late with a sliding challenge on Patrick Dorgu, but as United retained possession, referee Andrew Kitchen waved play on. Mere moments earlier, he had cautioned the former United full-back for catching Mason Mount with his studs.",
      "The choice to let play continue following Wan-Bissaka's second careless tackle has been criticised by United supporters. They believe he ought to have been shown a second yellow card, and Hackett shares this view.",
      "He told Football Insider: \"Whilst I think that Andrew Kitchen had a very good game, I would like him to review the two Wan-Bissaka challenges, particularly the last one. On a yellow card, you put in a reckless challenge, he should have had a second yellow followed by the red.\"",
      "\"He's a lucky guy. Andrew, you've got to keep focused up until the final whistle.\"",
      "The draw has lifted United to eighth position, though it will be viewed as a squandered chance given that victory would have propelled them to fifth, leapfrogging Crystal Palace, whom they defeated last weekend.",
      "Predictably, Ruben Amorim was visibly displeased during his post-match media briefing, with the United manager particularly incensed by claims that performances had stagnated or regressed.",
      "He said: \"It's not going backwards. The results are going backwards. We had some moments. That can happen.",
      "\"You were talking about when we had that run that team was really perfect and saying we are not that far from being in the perfect moment. We are really inconsistent.",
      "\"But if you look at the goal, 83 minutes, we have a long ball, we have everything under control and we need to do better.\"",
      "United will get the opportunity to bounce back immediately from that disappointment when they take on the Premier League's bottom side Wolves next Monday evening.",
      "Amorim anticipates having Matthijs de Ligt available again for the encounter, with Ayden Heaven, who deputised for the Dutch defender against the Hammers, substituted at the interval.",
      "A silver lining for Amorim and United was Matheus Cunha's comeback, with additional encouragement coming as neither Dorgu nor Casemiro collected yellow cards that would trigger a ban for the Molineux fixture.",

The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can’t control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave but it is probably best for him now, enough is enough.”",
      "And it is hard to find a United fan who would agree with a selection policy that has seen Mainoo fail to start a Premier League match this season. But no matter what the likes of Scholes say, it is clear Amorim is unconcerned with public opinion and repeats that Mainoo is not doing enough on the training ground to earn himself significant game time.",
      "An exasperated Amorim said: “You always ask me the same thing. I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that does not mean I need to put Kobbie (in the team) when I feel I shouldn’t put Kobbie (in the team).”",
      "Mainoo is one of very few players in the United first-team squad not to start a Premier League game. And Amorim was asked if he could understand why the academy graduate might be demoralised with his current place in the pecking order.",
      "The United boss responded: “I see it. I see it and just want to win. I just put the players (in the team) - I don’t look who it is.",
      "“I don’t care about that. I just try to put the best players on the pitch. You have (Manuel) Ugarte that played two games - one of them, Case (Casemiro) was out. Bruno (Fernandes) is always fit. He’s the guy that is doing his (Mainoo’s) position so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "Many pundits and fans would see that response as an example of Amorim’s tactical inflexibility but the Portuguese coach might have to adapt when he loses Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo to Africa Cup of Nations duty. So, will that give Mainoo a chance to re-establish himself?",
      "“I don’t know, I don’t know,” sighed Amorim. “It’s the same question. I don’t know what is going to happen. It depends. If I see in training that it is the best thing, I will put (do) it. That is the only way I know how to respond to that.”",
      "After the disappointment of conceding a late equaliser to West Ham, Amorim takes his side to Wolves on Monday night to face a side that has yet to record a Premier League victory this season. Rob Edwards' side has just two points from 14 fixtures.",
      "But Amorim warned: “Everything can happen and that will change. There is no team in the history of the Premier League that didn’t win one game.",
      "\"It can be any game. So we need to try to improve, rest the players, work really well and prepare for a tough match because with us it’s always a tough match.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jamie Carragher responded with laughing and money bag emojis in a brutal response to Rio Ferdinand following an interview he gave on the upcoming 2026 World Cup draw. The former Manchester United defender is one of the hosts in America for the competition, which will determine the group setup.",
      "FIFA have come under fire ahead of the World Cup due to the cost of tickets for fans, with one recent listing for a ticket to the semi-final on the official resale platform going for £161,000. In the build-up to the draw, Ferdinand was questioned about the ticketing prices and whether the game should be more accessible.",
      "He said to the BBC: \"I am a man of the people in terms of I'm from a place where we were always hoping for things to be accessible. I know that the people behind the scenes at FIFA are aiming and working to something like that now, whether they get there for that remains to be seen.",
      "\"I think we have to be conscious of that and I think FIFA are definitely people who are conscious of that, the powers that be there. I think we can look at every industry, every sector, we have that conversation about things and I think it's more about making sure that there's a product that's super elite that matches what's on the pitch and then everyone can feel that it's justified taking time out and working hard to go and get tickets.\"",
      "Ferdinand came under fire for some of his comments, which included a brutal response from Carragher under the video of the interview. The former Liverpool defender posted some laughing emojis above emojis of some money bags.",
      "The conversation over the ticket prices isn't the only thing to overshadow the draw for the upcoming World Cup in North America. There is also the FIFA Peace Prize, a new award that is expected to be handed to American President Donald Trump during the draw ceremony.",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino is set to commence the draw, while the hosts and draw assistants have now been named. Ferdinand is one of those hosts, joined by Samantha Johnson and Eli Manning.",
      "The draw assistants are made up of some of America's biggest sporting stars, with Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal, Wayne Gretzky and Aaron Judge helping to pick the groups. England are in pot one, with Thomas Tuchel set to guide the Three Lions towards potential glory.",
      "The 2026 World Cup marks 60 years since the England men's team lifted a major trophy, a wait that was almost ended twice under previous boss Gareth Southgate, who reached two European Championship finals. The nation's recent run at the World Cup finals saw them reach the semi-final and the quarter-final.",
      "\"We're getting closer. I think we're getting stronger. The target is to arrive in June with a strong squad, and the emphasis is on the squad and the team spirit,\" Tuchel told BBC Sport on the eve of the draw in Washington DC. \"Then hopefully we get the momentum and the energy around the team right so that, during the tournament, no-one wants to play against us.\"",
      "\"We need to wait until the draw but we have a clear idea against whom we want to play,\" he said when asked about which opponents England could play in March's international break. \"It's a tricky window because it's friendly matches.",
      "\"It's preparation for the World Cup but don't forget, right before the World Cup we have two friendly matches to play. A lot of players will hopefully be involved in the Champions League, FA Cup semi-finals, finals, the Carabao Cup, Europa League, Conference League.",
      "\"It can become a tricky window for us in terms of how to approach it and in terms of who to play against - but the tendency [intention] is that we will play very competitive matches and we will figure out with what group we do this [in order] to learn the most and [gain] the most from it.\"",

      "Lingard stunned many when he chose to move to South Korea as he sought a new club several years ago. He headed to the K League club on a free transfer in February 2024 and has made 66 appearances, scoring 18 goals.",
      "His last game will be on Wednesday against Melbourne City in the AFC Champions League with the former England international finishing on a high after a difficult start, which saw him called out by his manager, before he was later made captain.",

The love, support and the appreciation you have shown towards me for these last two years has been truly amazing. I'll always be grateful for the opportunity to play for such a massive club.\"",

      "Gabriel, who only turned 15 in October, has already been making waves for United's Under-18 side. He has 10 goals in 10 games for the Under-18s this season, including hat-tricks against Derby and Liverpool.",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, his form has sparked transfer speculation, Barcelona have been heavily linked with a move which could see the teenager link up with Marcus Rashford, whose loan from United could well lead to a permanent switch next summer.",
      "So far, though, the efforts of director of football Jason Wilcox have convinced Gabriel to stay put. He is expected to turn down a Barca move - at least for now - and fans have been encouraged by the photo with Ferguson.",
      "\"You stay with us, don't go anywhere. You'll definitely be promoted to the senior team soon,\" one fan commented on Gabriel's Instagram post with the former manager. \"Hopefully the Boss convinced you to stay. Your future's here,\" another wrote.",
      "Gabriel and his camp are also said to have spoken privately with Ruben Amorim. United's head coach has invited the youngster to train with the senior side previously and has publicly sung his praises.",
      "\"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy, and everyone paid attention on social media,\" Amorim said in the autumn. \"You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "\"Not just for me to see for tomorrow, but also for them to feel what it means to be in the first-team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it's important, not just for JJ, but for everyone.\"",
      "Gabriel and Ferguson weren't able to witness a United win on Thursday night. Diogo Dalot put United in front against West Ham after a goalless first half, but Soungoutou Magassa levelled things up for the visitors late on.",
      "\"I think the overall performance was not perfect,\" Amorim told Match of the Day. \"We had our moments but we lost control in the game in some minutes in the first half and in the second half, especially after the goal. The game was clearly ours to win and we had an opportunity with Cunha to finish the game. \"",

      "He is concerned that his lack of starts will wreck his chances of being involved in next summer's World Cup. Italian outfit AS Roma are one of several clubs keen to sign him on-loan.",
      "But the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko has given Zirkzee a rare chance to prove himself. And former England and Liverpool striker Heskey believes Zirkzee can still cut the mustard at Old Trafford, provided he is given the right support.",
      "\"Joshua Zirkzee has not had an easy start to life at Manchester United,\" said Heskey, speaking Sports betting site Betwright. \"He's had a really tough time and been scrutinised since he joined the club, but he’s playing with far less fear now - we saw that against Crystal Palace.",
      "\"Hopefully he can use that game as a turning point to really kick on, especially in Benjamin Sesko's absence. From what I've seen, Zirkzee looks like a good investment for the future.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka once again came back to haunt his old club this week. And some stars in Ruben Amorim's squad won't be surprised, given their past praise for the full-back's talent.",
      "The 28-year-old was arguably the best player on the pitch as West Ham frustrated United to a 1-1 draw on Thursday. The man affectionately known as 'The Spider' for his tackling range and ability to regain possession did a job in squashing a litany of attacks from his old side back at Old Trafford.",
      "Not only did Wan-Bissaka win 11 duels and make 12 defensive contributions, but he also played a prominent role in attack for the Hammers. And it's not the first time he's frustrated the Red Devils since leaving the club for just £15million last year.",
      "In fact, the DR Congo international boasted a 100 per cent record against United playing for West Ham prior to Thursday's draw. But there are some at the Theatre of Dreams who won't be shocked to have witnessed his impact since moving to east London.",
      "It wasn't long after his £45m move from Crystal Palace in the summer of 2019 that reports emerged of \"frustration\" within the United camp. That was according to United icon Darren Fletcher, who suggested team-mates were flummoxed by their inability to get past the defender.",
      "\"I was talking to some Manchester United players, and they were saying that no player has managed to pass Wan-Bissaka in training this season,\" he told Norway's TV2. \"It's as if he refuses to let them pass.",
      "\"He has to get better technically, but he is a fantastic full-back. When he gets better technically, he's going to take his game to a new level. He is a fantastic defensive player and contributor for Manchester United.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag clearly didn't agree when he sanctioned Wan-Bissaka's cut-price sale to West Ham in 2024. The full-back left United for a third of the fee they acquired him for five years prior and has shone for his new club since then.",
      "As if to highlight the potential misstep even more, Amorim could have done with an additional full-back presence in recent times. Amad Diallo has been converted into a right wing-back this term but can leave a little to be desired in defence.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui has impressed in patches, though injury setbacks have curtailed his momentum this term. The Morocco international is also set to depart for the Africa Cup of Nations this month and will be unavailable for several weeks.",
      "Everything looks better in hindsight, and it's worth remembering Wan-Bissaka displayed dips in form long prior to being sold by United. However, his recent displays against his old side have demonstrated he perhaps had a talent worth nurturing after all.",

      "Last week, Amorim said he considers Mainoo \"a starter\" despite not playing him from the first whistle once in the league this season. The England international did start in the Carabao Cup at Grimsby in August - a tie which ended in defeat.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other players,\" Amorim said last Friday. \"I just have to make a choice and then in the end, it's not been Kobbie.",

      "Scholes has since deleted the post about Mainoo, who was snubbed while Mason Mount, Manuel Ugarte, Patrick Dorgu, Leny Yoro and Lisandro Martinez were brought on before United conceded a late goal against the Hammers on Thursday.",

      "Gary Neville laid into Manchester United’s players for a lack of intensity during the 1-1 draw against West Ham on Thursday, with club captain Bruno Fernandes the only player to emerge with any credit. The United icon was incensed with the result and couldn't get his head around their performance.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side initially took the lead in the second half at Old Trafford courtesy of a strike from Diogo Dalot. However, a late effort from West Ham’s Soungoutou Magassa meant the points were ultimately shared in what can only be viewed as a missed opportunity for the Red Devils.",
      "United have had a favourable run of fixtures in recent weeks, which continues this weekend with a trip to face a struggling Wolves side. However, with just four points from a possible nine, Neville is rueing the team’s failure to capitalise on their rivals’ struggles and climb the league table.",
      "In a rather scathing review of United’s performance against the Hammers, the former defender and pundit criticised the lack of intensity and drive when chasing a goal.",
      "He deemed Fernandes the only player who showed real fight and any impetus to push forward, take risks and search for the all-important winner.",
      "\"This was a massive opportunity,\" he explained on the Gary Neville podcast. “You saw the games they had lined up [against Everton, Palace and West Ham] and they won the most difficult game [vs Palace].",
      "\"But unfortunately, they’re not taking their chances to get up there and be up there. And I don’t get it. I don’t get the lack of urgency and lack of intensity.",
      "\"I don’t get the slow play and the lack of risk in the game. I suspect Amorim isn’t going into the changing room saying 'Guys, play slowly tonight.' He’s going in there and saying to move the ball quickly and to play with real threat and vigour.",
      "\"But it doesn’t transpire out on the pitch. I don’t see the appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game and everything you’ve got. Bruno [Fernandes] does look a little bit like he does that, you could see him at the end there trying to get everywhere.",
      "\"I actually see that little bit of panic in him that we can’t draw this game. I don’t see it in enough of the others. I don’t see. I still see them being quite [passive] letting the game drift or walking to a throw-in.\"",
      "Amorim's side are currently eighth in the Premier League standings following Thursday's result. They are level on points with Liverpool and Brighton and just two off the top four as things stand.",
      "However, had they held on for the victory against the Hammers, they would have moved up to fifth, behind Chelsea only on goal difference. Given how tight the table is from second downwards, every point will be crucial in the race for Champions League football this season.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is set to debrief with his players on Friday following Thursday night's disappointing 1-1 draw against West Ham in the Premier League.",
      "The Red Devils initially took the lead in the second half through a well-taken finish from Diogo Dalot inside the box. However, they were unable to hold on and secure all three points, as Soungoutou Magassa struck a late equaliser for the Hammers at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim's side remain eighth in the standings, level on 22 points with both Liverpool and Brighton. As things stand, they sit just two points off the top four, but that did little to silence accusations that United have regressed in recent games after such a positive run of form - much to the manager's frustration.",
      "Speaking in his post-match press conference on Thursday, a rather spiky Amorim addressed those claims, while also confirming his plans to debrief the result with his players once the dust has settled.",
      "It emerged last season, after a defeat to Brighton in January, that the United boss damaged a television screen in the dressing room during a furious critique of his players, with a more calm and measured approach having been taken ever since.",
      "\"In that regard, I'm almost always consistent,\" Amorim explained to the media on. \"I had one and you know. Brighton last year. I will talk to them tomorrow.\"",
      "The West Ham draw comes on the back of a mixed week of results, in which United were beaten 1-0 at home by Everton, despite the visitors being reduced to 10 men early in the game. However, they bounced back impressively over the weekend to come from behind and beat Crystal Palace away from home.",
      "While Amorim admits his side are far too inconsistent at present, he refused to be drawn on the notion they are regressing after appearing to turn a corner earlier in the campaign. \"It’s not going backwards,” he added.",
      "\"The results are going backwards. We had some moments. That can happen. You were talking about when we had that run that team was really perfect and saying we are not that far from being in the perfect moment.",
      "\"We are really inconsistent. But if you look at the goal, 83 minutes, we have a long ball, we have everything under control and we need to do better.\"",
      "United return to action this weekend with a trip to face a struggling Wolves side. The Midlands club are rock bottom of the standings with just two points from their 14 league games so far this term.",
      "The Red Devils will be hoping to use the opportunity to regain ground in the top-four race before tricky tests against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle later in the month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's chances of signing Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba may have improved, as Brighton are reportedly eyeing a potential replacement for the 21-year-old. Any deal could possibly pave the way for the midfielder's big-money exit.",
      "The Cameroon international was rumoured to be on his way to Old Trafford last summer, seen as a key addition to bolster their midfield. However, United did not make a bid for Baleba, having been quoted a fee in excess of £100million.",
      "Instead, Ruben Amorim and his recruitment department focused their resources on strengthening their forward and goalkeeping departments.",
      "This meant that a revamp of the midfield was put on hold for future transfer windows, with several players being identified as targets for upcoming markets.",
      "Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have been mentioned as possible options, while interest in Baleba continues to be reported as a priority for the coming months despite his patchy form this term.",
      "Whether United will table an offer that could prise him away from Brighton - with his valuation believed to be around £100million - remains to be seen. However, Brighton's activity in the market could increase United's chances of securing the midfielder.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Brighton are interested in Aston Villa's Lamare Bogarde as part of a plan to replace Baleba in the near future. That suggests that Brighton could be open to selling Baleba if their valuation is met.",
      "Bogarde, also 21, is said to be valued at over £25m. He has broken into the first team under Unai Emery, despite stiff competition for places.",
      "Bogarde, nephew of former Chelsea and Barcelona player Winston Bogarde, is now set to carve out his own footballing path. Brighton's potential acquisition of the Villa midfielder could pave the way for Baleba's departure in the near future.",
      "The report suggests that the Seagulls could command a fee north of £100m, given the current market rates for a young defensive midfielder with the ability to disrupt play and control the game.",
      "This development could be timely for United, especially with Casemiro's contract due to expire in 2026 and uncertainty surrounding the futures of Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "He said: \"Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they? But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure. Adam Wharton is a really good player, but can he get around the pitch. Old Trafford is a big pitch, you need to have some physicality.",
      "\"I'd say going off the England form, which has surprised me more than anything, but Elliot Anderson. I really liked him at Newcastle but thought he was more of an attacking player, but he's come into as a No.8 for England and looked very accomplished.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days. I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.\"",

      "Amorim was referring to United conceding the corner that resulted in Magassa pouncing for the leveller and he was clearly annoyed.",

      "The Red Devils squandered their lead and had to settle for a share of the points against the relegation-threatened side. Diogo Dalot's opener was as good as it got for the hosts with their head coach attempting to make changes to press home their advantage and see the game out.",
      "Amorim haad used all five of his substitutions by full-time - Leny Yoro replaced Ayden Heaven at half time, Dalot was brought off for Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount were brought on at the same time to replace Matheus Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee. In injury time Luke Shaw with Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Mainoo has not started a game since the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August and has now been an unused substitute for the fourth time in the Premier League this season.",
      "The United boss was quizzed on whether he would change his subs if he had his time again and replied: \"No, we are losing because of the second balls, sometimes it’s not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offence? Who? Who would be more offensive?\"",
      "Mainoo’s name was suggested, but Amorim laughed and replied: \"Yes, it was the second ball and I was worried with Matheus, I know Bruno [Fernandes] reached the box really well, Mason Mount is playing in his position, they were trying to push us, Bryan [Mbeumo] has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one transition, so that was my idea.\"",
      "There has been talk of Mainoo leaving Manchester despite him enjoying a sensational start to his career. He was a huge hit under Erik ten Hag but his stock has fallen since Amorim arrived into the dugout.",
      "There is talk of a loan exit for Mainoo with the likes of Napoli linked with the midfielder, who previously started in the Euro 2024 final for England. Amorim has continued to field questions on the academy graduate, but has often referred to him in a team context.",
      "\"You talk a lot of about Kobbie,\" he said. \"I have more players in my squad that want to be in the World Cup, so it's a little bit unfair. I put Kobbie [in on Monday] because he's really good near the box, to have a guy like Bruno and him, they can find spaces near the box and score goals. So that was my idea. So, I will use Kobbie and the rest of them to try for the team to win. So, I'm not just focused on one individual.\"",

You’re looking for players to come on with presence. If anything they brought the levels down at United. That seemed to be the case tonight.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim dismissed claims he had no faith in the Manchester United academy but refused to offer Kobbie Mainoo any guarantees that he would get a chance when the club lose players to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute during United's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday despite being one of only two attacking options on the bench. He has managed just 171 minutes of Premier League football this season and his only start came in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old will return to the scene of one of his best moments in a United shirt on Monday night. Mainoo scored a stunning winning goal at Molineux in February 2024, during a remarkable breakout season that ended with him playing in a European Championship final.",
      "However, he has fallen out of favour under Amorim and doesn't look like forcing his way into the team anytime soon. Manuel Ugarte came on for Joshua Zirkzee against the Hammers and quizzed about Mainoo's prospects before the trip to Wolves, Amorim became frustrated at the topic coming up again.",
      "“Of course I understand [why you ask], and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing,\" he said.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.”",
      "Amorim accepted that Mainoo's situation was becoming deflating for the academy graduate, who could leave on loan during the January transfer window.",
      "But he insisted his team selection was purely down to picking the best players and that he didn't see Mainoo in the best XI this season.",
      "“I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch,\" he said.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "Asked if AFCON could be Mainoo's route into the team, Amorim added: \"I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Amorim's faith in the academy has been questioned recently. He has shunted Mainoo to the margins of the squad and although youngsters such as Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey have made the bench this season, they haven't made it onto the pitch.",
      "It was put to Amorim that he didn't trust the academy, and he went on to explain why Lacey has made the bench for three games in a row but not made an appearance.",
      "\"“But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard,\" he said.",
      "“So you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.”",

      "Manchester United are in the dark over whether Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be available to face Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday, December 15.",
      "FIFA has confirmed that date is when players should be released for duty in AFCON, with the tournament starting on Sunday, December 21, but it is unclear whether that date is for every player, or whether it will move in line for each nation's first game in the tournament.",
      "Mazraoui's Morocco enter the competition in the first game, but Amad's Ivory Coast and Mbeumo's Cameroon don't play their first games in the tournament until Christmas Eve, which leaves open the possibility they could face the Cherries.",
      "FIFA released a statement earlier this week confirming the release date of December 15, but it didn't offer full clarity on whether that date would be moved if a country began their campaign later. The only Premier League game on the day of December 15 is United's clash with Bournemouth.",
      "Asked if he knew when players would be leaving his squad to link up with their countries, Amorim said: \"No, we are dealing with everything. They are going to play the next game and that is the only thing I care.\"",
      "United are in talks with three different national federations to seek clarity on when they expect players to arrive and whether they can retain their AFCON trio for the fixture against Bournemouth. That is the final game of that Premier League weekend, which means the other 18 clubs will be able to field their players who have been called up.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim is confident Matthijs de Ligt and Diogo Dalot will be fit to face Wolves on Monday night. De Ligt missed Thursday's draw with West Ham after picking up a knock and Dalot came off not long after scoring, but both could be in contention at Molineux.",
      "Wolves remain winless after 14 games and have just two points, leaving them rooted to the foot of the table. Their dismal record could make this a banana skin for United and Amorim has warned against complacency.",
      "\"Everything can happen and that will change,\" he said. \"There is no team in the history of the Premier League that didn’t win one game. It can be any game. So we need to try to improve, rest the players, work really well and prepare a tough match because with us it’s always a tough match.\"",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday night. United got back to winning ways in the Premier League against Crystal Palace last weekend but they failed to build on that victory.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "Anger on the touchline",
      "United were on course to claim back-to-back Premier League victories, but they conceded from a corner with just eight minutes remaining.",
      "Carlos Fernandes, United's set-piece coach, stands up on the touchline to oversee every set play, and he angrily reacted to Magassa's goal by storming back to his seat on the bench.",
      "Fernandes looked furious as he returned to his seat. United have majorly improved their threat from attacking set-pieces this season - no team in the league has scored more - but they must improve defensively.",
      "Magassa equalised because he was the most player alert in the box, which will irk Fernandes.",
      "Amorim was happy with Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team last weekend and delivered an improved display at left wing-back after briefly losing his starting role to Patrick Dorgu. Dalot made his 150th appearance in the Premier League at Selhurst Park and followed that milestone by scoring his 10th goal for United.",
      "Casemiro's shot fortuitously made its way to Dalot in the box and he finished well. Once the team celebrations were over, Dalot roared to the Stretford End and pumped his fists.",
      "Amorim made the decision to replace Dalot with Dorgu in the 68th minute, and it was interesting to see Dalot exchange words with his manager as he left the field. The United boss appeared to explain why Dalot had been taken off, and he nodded in approval of his performance.",
      "The gloves came off",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was given the nod to start again after scoring against Crystal Palace last weekend and looked sharp in the first half, linking up intelligently with his teammates around the box.",
      "He had a chance of his own, which was headed wide, but picked up where he left off when play resumed following half-time, combining brilliantly with Bryan Mbeumo to create a chance in front of the Stretford End.",
      "It came to nothing. Zirkzee reacted by removing his gloves, throwing them to the side, which felt like he meant business. Although Zirkzee did not score, his display was pleasing, and he brought gasps from the crowd when he brought the ball down dead with a superb first touch. \"What a touch,\" a fan said near the press box.",
      "The problem is that Zirkzee is not a natural goalscorer, and United might have put the game to bed if he'd scored before he was brought off for Mason Mount in the second half.",
      "Hellish start from Heaven",
      "Ayden Heaven was selected to start his first Premier League game since the final day of last season due to Matthijs de Ligt's absence. The youngster started in the centre of the back three and made a poor start to the game, picking up a yellow card in just the seventh minute for a clumsy tackle.",
      "Callum Wilson has entered the winter of his career but he had the better of Heaven when he picked up the ball. The former England international drove at Heaven at every opportunity.",
      "Heaven almost brought Wilson down in the box with an outstretched leg, which made Amorim react as he sent Leny Yoro to warm up on the byline just 17 minutes into the game.",
      "Yoro warmed up for the rest of the half, which suggested Heaven would be hooked. Then Yoro emerged to warm up during half-time - this time without his jumper - and the change was made by Amorim.",
      "Heaven has been given limited minutes this season and he was, understandably, rusty.",
      "Vivell in the directors' box",
      "Christopher Vivell was spotted in the directors' box. Vivell joined United on a temporary basis last year and was appointed permanently as the director of recruitment in February.",
      "The German slid over in the directors' box, seemingly to look at which scouts and agents were present at the game, and he will be hugely influential again when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Amorim recently confirmed that United could be active in the market, although the club spent £215million (excluding add-ons) in the summer window and funds will be limited in January.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens with Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo. Zirkzee retained his starting role against West Ham, but Mainoo is still yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "Mainoo requested to leave on loan in the final week of the summer window and is expected to do the same next month. Whether such a request is entertained remains to be seen.",

      "If anything sums up Manchester United's inability to plot a smooth course under Ruben Amorim, it is the manner of the goal that denied them a crucial win against West Ham.",
      "A day on from talking up their ability from set-pieces, United were undone by one. The equaliser from an 83rd-minute corner was a reminder that vulnerabilities remain and for all the improvement in the other box, they are still weak in their own. It was a painful blow for a side who looked on course to stick themselves into the Champions League conversation.",
      "There was no anger at the final whistle this time, as there had been against Everton. Instead, it was a resigned silence. None of the players on the pitch slumped to their knees, but they put their hands on their hips and stared at the ground. This wasn't the performance of a team destined for the big time in Europe, but a win had them heading in that direction.",
      "Now they will look on and curse another result that got away, another goal conceded from a corner and another second-half they have failed to win.",
      "This was the one-year anniversary of his first defeat as head coach and they have been regular occurrences since then, 22 all told, including penalty shoot-outs to Fulham and Grimsby.",
      "That this didn't end in another defeat was little consolation for a crestfallen Amorim. There has been the whiff of progress recently, but this team's ability to shoot themselves in the foot - and just about every other part of the body - is crushingly frustrating. To sandwich a win at Crystal Palace with a dismal defeat to 10-man Everton and a draw with a dire West Ham, both at Old Trafford, only reinforces the sense that it is one step forward and one backwards.",
      "United were again slow to get going, showing a lack of intensity in the early stages that is baffling, given their reduced schedule this season. Once again, they allowed a team to get a foothold in a game at Old Trafford.",
      "Ayden Heaven's early woes didn't help. The 19-year-old was starting his first Premier League game of the season and was in the middle of a back three, but his inexperience was preyed on by grizzled veteran Callum Wilson. It didn't take long for Wilson to realise he had the upper hand.",
      "It was Bryan Mbeumo who began to rouse United into life. His short-corner routine with Bruno Fernandes led to a curling shot that forced Alphonse Areola into a fine save. Joshua Zirkzee bundled an effort goalwards that was cleared off the line and Fernandes volleyed a follow-up just off target.",
      "Set-pieces have often been the route to goal this season, but with Matthijs de Ligt joining Harry Maguire and Benjamin Sesko on the sidelines, there was a lack of height against a team who had plenty of it.",
      "That was putting the onus on United to find their ruthless streak as well as their creative streak. They had moments of the latter. Amad's quick feet created Zirkzee's first-half chance and he often looked the most likely to make something happen. Zirkzee's first-time pass into Mbeumo early in the second half deserved a finish.",
      "Instead, Mbeumo was beaten to the ball by Freddie Potts and that seemed to sum up United in front of goal. Zirkzee's link-up play was good, Matheus Cunha was probing, Mbeumo was lively and Amad was direct, but none of them have the killer touch in front of goal.",
      "So it was no surprise that the game was unlocked via a slice of good fortune. Casemiro's long-range shot wasn't going to trouble West Ham, but the deflection spun it into the path of Dalot, unmarked and 10 yards out. He had enough space to take a touch and fire a low finish into the Stretford End net.",
      "United looked to hold what they have and Amorim's defensive subs reflected the nervousness, but having talked up their set-piece ability, they were undone by one instead. Amorim admitted that they still had work to do defensively and West Ham found it too easy to level. Jarrod Bowen's flick-on was brilliantly cleared by Noussair Mazraoui, but Soungoutou Magassa slammed in the rebound.",
      "It was from two corners that Arsenal condemned Amorim to his first defeat a year ago. That another corner proved their Achilles heel against the Hammers summed up a team that just can't kick on.",

      "Manchester United saw the chance to go fifth in the Premier League slip through their fingers as they threw away a lead against West Ham at Old Trafford. Diogo Dalot's goal just before the hour mark looked like landing Ruben Amorim back-to-back wins in the Premier League but momentum was again checked.",

      "Senne Lammens: One wayward kick in the first half but was solid aside from that. Didn't have a lot to do but safe hands when Bowen's shot was deflected his way. Nothing he could do to prevent the goal. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Solid on his return to the team. A vital late block and a goalline clearance that deserved more than the rebound going in. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: First Premier League start of the season but he had a half to forget. Callum Wilson played on his lack of experience, he got too tight at times and was booked for a rash tackle on Jarrod Bowen. 4",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended well for the most part and saw plenty of the ball in the second half when United were probing for an opening, but a lack of height at the back was exposed. 6",
      "Amad: Created a chance for Joshua Zirkzee with quick feet and looked like making things happen again. Needs to get the ball high up the pitch to really influence the game. 7",
      "Casemiro: Wasn't great on the ball and didn't bring the composure United needed in their game. Got an assist but more through luck than judgment. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: His range of passing in the first half was good but snatched at two injury-time chances to win the game. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Struggled against Aaron Wan-Bissaka at times in the first half but showed superb composure to take his goal well. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Probably the most likely of the front three to score and forced Alphonse Areola into a good save, but should have done better with a second-half chance. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: Not at his best on his return to the team. The odd nice touch but seemed a little lost in his role and didn't really threaten. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Did well to force Wan-Bissaka into a goalline clearance in the first half and his link-up play was outstanding at times, with one brilliant pass to Mbeumo. 7",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Unconvincing under one early high ball and clearly lacking a bit of confidence at the moment. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: An enterprising run after replacing Dalot and will be pleased with his solid cameo. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Came on to see the game out and failed. 5",
      "Mason Mount: Not much time to make an impression. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Malacia, Mainoo, Lacey",

      "Matheus Cunha isn't likely to forget Manchester United's trip to Molineux last season in a hurry. Wearing the old gold of Wolves, the Brazilian scored direct from a corner as his stock rose in the Premier League.",
      "That was one of 15 goals in 33 Premier League appearances last term, as well as six assists. It was an impressive record in a struggling team and Cunha looked to have the swagger and self-confidence to make it at Old Trafford, which is why United didn't think twice about activating his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Cunha has had a taste of a big club previously, but a two-year stint at Atletico Madrid never took off and he left the Spanish capital to move to Wolves. Now more settled in his game, more mature, and shining in a system almost identical to Ruben Amorim's, he looked an obvious signing for United.",
      "With Premier League experience, he was also expected to hit the ground running, but that hasn't happened. While Bryan Mbeumo has settled quickly after his move from Brentford, Cunha has found the going tougher.",
      "Amorim said he had \"more levels to go\" on Wednesday and mentioned the \"different pressure\" of playing for a club like United. With one goal so far and zero assists, it is clear that the lack of returns are weighing on Cunha's mind. Speaking before his return to the team against West Ham after missing the last two fixtures, Amorim suggested the 26-year-old was still enjoying his influence on the team.",
      "\"What I mean is that I think he feels that he wants to score. He wants to assist,\" said Amorim. \"But he is really happy playing the game. It is really important.",
      "\"I think he struggled with these two games out. He was struggling because he wants to play. He had fun playing the game And that is so important in our team. Guys having fun. Wanting the challenge. The pressure. He is that guy. So I think it was not good for him to stop playing.",
      "\"He watched a lot of players playing well. Especially in his position. So he is not happy. Tomorrow maybe he will have the opportunity to come back and to score again or assist.\"",
      "His return to action on Thursday didn't go to plan. He snatched at one presentable chance to double United's lead but was generally on the periphery of the game, outshone as a creative force by Mbeumo, as well as Joshua Zirkzee and Amad. He looked out on his feet before he was withdrawn with 15 minutes to go.",
      "In a team struggling for creativity and goals, it is clear United need more from a £62.5million Brazilian wearing the No.10 shirt. Cunha needs to take inspiration from Mbeumo, who has taken his confidence from Brentford and shown it on the bigger stage.",
      "There are times when Cunha appears to be playing within himself and not displaying the cocksure attitude he had when he was shining for Wolves.",
      "He has the talent to make a big difference to this United team. Cunha is adept at receiving the ball between the lines and bringing drive and pace from those attacking midfield roles. He can be an aggressive ball carrier and as well as having an eye for goal, he can be a creator.",
      "His attacking output has not changed significantly since he moved from Wolves. In three seasons in the Midlands, he averaged 3.07 shots per 90 minutes. So far at United, he is averaging 3.17 shots per 90 minutes. That might well be a reflection of United's disappointing attack rather than Cunha not raising his game.",
      "Perhaps a return to familiar surroundings on Monday night will spark something in him. It will be interesting to see what kind of reaction Cunha gets there. It is his departure that looks to have sealed Wolves' fate and they appear destined for a return to the Championship.",
      "Their star man has gone on to bigger and better things, but he needs to start delivering more in a red shirt.",

      "The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw caught plenty of attention - as fans around the world tuned in to discover which nations would be facing off for the ultimate prize in international football.",
      "It was an evening filled with plenty of surprises - many of which came under-fire from spectators - who were left baffled by how long the draw took, along with many different segments planned out by Gianni Infantino.",
      "Among many of the huge calls on the evening was the decision to place former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, as one of the main hosts for proceedings, as he took centre stage for the key moment.",
      "The ex-England international summed up proceedings, explaining why certain teams were drawn out in particular groups due to the way the draw rules work.",
      "Between each pot being drawn, Danny Ramirez was in the crowd speaking to former footballers who featured at the top of the game, which included former Manchester City star Yaya Toure.",
      "The ex-midfielder was asked about the draw for Ivory Coast, before Ramirez made an awkward point about Toure and Ferdinand in front of the crowd.",
      "He said: \"I know you and Rio, you used to play for rival clubs. Are you guys friends?\" to which Toure replied: \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "Ferdinand seemed a little less pleased with the line of questioning, as he responded: \"Haha, what you trying to do here Danny? I know you're trying to get in the middle here, what are you doing?\"",
      "Ramirez said: \"I'm trying to start it up,\" before Ferdinand continued: \"But I haven't really forgiven Yaya for that 2012 title race where they took it off us but it's fine... I'm over it man, come on, let me live man.\"",
      "It rounded up an awkward reunion for the pair, who had quite a few meetings in their time in the Premier League against each other.",
      "Ferdinand faced off with Toure 12 times during his career - winning three, drawing twice and losing seven times, showing who got the better of that rivalry - three of those meetings were when the midfielder was at Barcelona.",
      "The 2011/2012 Premier League title race is clearly still a sore point for those United players who were involved in such an intense race to the finish line.",
      "It was United who were leading the race at the top, having sealed a win over Sunderland, before Sergio Aguero's famous last-gasp winner secured the title for City in the final day.",

      "Manchester United fans were seething after drawing with West Ham on Thursday night, but some became angrier when they got home from Old Trafford and checked their phones. Footage from a tense post-match press conference had been posted on social media, and supporters watched Ruben Amorim laugh at the suggestion that Kobbie Mainoo was a good option to bring on.",
      "\"Who is the man we have to put in the offence?\" asked Amorim in reply to a question about his conservative substitutions. \"Kobbie Mainoo,\" was the response, and Amorim laughed. The score was 1-1 when Lisandro Martinez was introduced for Luke Shaw with just a few minutes remaining. That change was laughable, not the suggestion that Mainoo would have been a better option to bring on.",
      "United needed a goal and Mainoo has been a scorer of a few brilliant goals since his breakthrough into the side. Mainoo made it 4-4 against Lyon in the Europa League quarter-final epic, he scored a peach against Liverpool at Old Trafford, and his solo effort against Wolves at Molineux was majestic.",
      "Amorim overlooked Mainoo in the final moments of the game in favour of bringing on a like-for-like defensive change. That is not how a United manager should act in those circumstances.",
      "Mainoo was given plenty to think about when Amoirm laughed at the question. Mainoo will see that footage and feel disrespected. He has not started in the Premier League this season, but Amorim's response confirmed what he probably already knew.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo would be accepted if United were flying in the Premier League, but the 40-year-old is not getting the results to vindicate overlooking a wonderful talent.",
      "The conversation about Amorim's future has intensified again after West Ham. United must make light work of bottom-half opponents to secure Champions League football, but they have struggled to carve out opportunities against Everton and West Ham at home across the last fortnight.",
      "The failure to secure a string of wins together regularly could be the downfall of Amorim. Ineos will not be able to justify keeping a manager if United continue to falter against teams they should be beating.",
      "What was particularly galling about the West Ham performance was the lack of quality in the final third, with even Diogo Dalot's goal having been fortuitously created following a deflected shot from Casemiro.",
      "Although doubts are growing over Amorim, one of the arguments in favour of persisting with the United boss is that his side are just two points adrift of fourth position. Fans who are still in favour of continuing with Amorim could argue that United could move into the Champions League places if they can build a run of decent results, but the fact is Amorim only recently secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since being appointed over a year ago.",
      "The evidence suggests building a good run of form any time soon is unlikely. And now the clash against Wolves on Monday night suddenly looks like a banana skin.",
      "Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They have amassed two points from 14 games and could beat Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",
      "United should win at Molineux, but the West Ham performance has put Amorim on dodgy ground again, and fans are thinking it would be 'typical United' to somehow lose that game.",
      "Losing against Wolves could spell trouble for Amorim. The Portuguese has suffered some dark days during his time in Manchester, but defeat against a pitiful Wolves would be the nadir.",
      "If United respond and claim three points, will they be able to back up that performance? It's tough to see it happening given the evidence available to us. There simply hasn't been enough progress.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already expressed his views on Mason Mount despite Roy Keane's recent critique of the midfielder, in which he labelled him a 'schoolboy'. The Reds have seen a slight improvement in their performance this season after a disappointing 2024/2025 campaign.",
      "However, recent results have been inconsistent - a defeat to Everton last week, followed by a victory over Crystal Palace last weekend, then a 1-1 draw at home to West Ham midweek.",
      "Amorim's team initially took the lead in the first half with a goal from Diogo Dalot. However, United were unable to secure the win and claim all three points as Soungoutou Magassa scored for the visitors late on.",
      "Mount began the match on the bench, but he was brought on to replace Joshua Zirkzee with just over 10 minutes remaining. Shortly afterwards, the Hammers found their equaliser and United were unable to regain the lead in the final moments.",
      "Keane, who made just under 500 appearances for United during his career, delivered a harsh critique of United's performance post-match, in which he also singled out Mount. Despite scoring the decisive goal against Palace at the weekend, the 26-year-old was dubbed a \"schoolboy\" by Keane on this occasion.",
      "\"When you are trying to see a game off, I look at Mason Mount when he came on, some players take longer to get up to speed but he was like a schoolboy out there. You're looking for players to come on with presence. If anything they brought the levels down at United. That seemed to be the case tonight.\"",
      "This is most likely an opinion that Amorim would reject, though, considering he has consistently been swift to commend Mount - dating back to when he was named United boss in November last year. From the very beginning, during his opening two weeks in charge, Mount's approach and resolve made an impression on Amorim.",
      "\"Mason Mount... I have to tell you, I love that kid,\" Amorim told United's club media just over 12 months ago. \"You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Despite injuries hampering Mount's season, during which he was side-lined for more than 20 matches with a hamstring injury, Amorim was eager to welcome the midfielder back into his squad. \"I really love Mason Mount,\" Amorim informed the press ahead of the midfielder's comeback in March.",
      "\"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club.\"",
      "The accolades didn't end there. Even as recently as last weekend, following United's victory over Palace, Mount revealed his true character as he comforted young defender Leny Yoro after a challenging match.",
      "The midfielder may have been the match-winner on that occasion, but his leadership qualities were evident at the final whistle, something that didn't escape Amorim's attention.",
      "\"For me, as a manager, it's really important,\" Amorim said earlier this week. \"But I take it as normal. If you spend so many hours with one guy, if you have a common goal, if you suffer all together.",
      "\"I think we should support each other because, in the end, we have our friends, we have our club but, in the end, we are the guys who can change everything.\"",
      "United return to action this weekend and will attempt to get back to winning ways when they take on Wolves at Molineux. Then, the run-up to Christmas will be in full swing with tricky tests against Bournemouth and Aston Villa.",

      "Mainoo, 20, has struggled for regular game-time under Amorim's leadership this term, featuring in just 10 matches across all competitions. However, the England player is yet to be handed a start by Amorim in the Premier League, with his only start coming in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town back in September.",
      "Thursday night saw Mainoo left on the substitute's bench for their 1-1 draw with West Ham in the Premier League. In total, the midfielder has played just 33 minutes in the last five top-flight matches for United, and he's not played more than 45 minutes in one match all season in the Premier League.",
      "Mainoo has been linked with a move away from United in recent weeks, with speculation that a loan deal may be on the cards when the January transfer window opens. A report in The Athletic claimed that Mainoo himself would be willing to leave United on loan in the New Year.",
      "A post by Sportbible via Instagram then showed quotes from Amorim's press conference, where the United head coach asked reporters which player would be more offensive-minded to bring into the game against West Ham. In turn, a reporter replied with Mainoo - with the post stating that Amorim laughed after the response.",
      "The post, which included the quotes in a graphic, was 'liked' by Mainoo's official account.",
      "Amorim was questioned about the midfielder during his a pre-match press conference. United's manager became frustrated at being forced to explain his team selection decisions once again.",
      "\"Of course, I understand [why you ask], and my job is to answer it, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I understand what you're saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim was also asked about the reason behind his team selection decisions, hinting at why it's difficult to earn a place in the United midfield.",
      "\"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, so I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch,\" he went on.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that has played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "United will face Wolves in the Monday Night Football in their next Premier League fixture, where it remains to be seen if Mainoo will get any minutes in that impending clash at Molineux.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Despite picking up a very good victory over Crystal Palace, there was a sense of trepidation ahead of Manchester United's clash with West Ham on Thursday evening. Last time United were under the lights at Old Trafford, they came unstuck as ten man Everton picked up a deserved victory.",
      "In the second half of that fixture, United had plenty of the ball but offered very little attacking threat. Joshua Zirkzee struggled to lead the line while build-up play, particularly down the left, often broke down. There were simply no solutions to turn to on the United bench, either.",
      "This is why what happened against West Ham was not a shock. On this occasion, United managed to score the opening goal through Diogo Dalot but instead of pushing for a second and killing off the game, the Reds made changes to consolidate their advantage. Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Lisandro Martinez were all brought on, the latter after the Reds had conceded.",
      "The only attack-minded substitution was Mason Mount. who replaced Zirkzee. The Dutchman has had his critics but at least he was offering good link-up play and having left the pitch, United were ill-prepared to refocus on attacking if West Ham found an equaliser, which they managed from a corner.",
      "After the game, Ruben Amorim was quizzed about his substitutions. He initially said his plan was to win more second balls after making the substitutions, but it was telling that Amorim also asked this question in reply: \"We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?\"",
      "This statement could be perceived as a message to the United boardroom. As he continues to overlook Kobbie Mainoo, who is more attack-minded than Ugarte but still obviously not an out-and-out attacking player, there were very few options Amorim would be willing to turn to.",
      "Since the international break, United have played three matches without Benjamin Sesko. In those matches, United have had a maximum of two players who are offensively-minded on the bench - during the Crystal Palace game it was just Shea Lacey.",
      "But the new norm at the minute is Mount and Lacey on the bench. Amorim simply does not have the options available to him to make attacking changes - even if he wanted to. Would throwing Lacey into the game on Thursday night have been helpful for the Reds? Probably not.",
      "He is a young player who has a bright future but he needs to be eased in to senior football. Lacey shouldn't be thrust into a game like that with an expectation to come up with a goal to kill the game off - not at this stage of his development, anyway.",
      "Amorim has uncovered a major priority heading into the January transfer window. If United pick up any more injuries or absence in their forward line, they will be even more stretched. Adding reinforcements to the squad - particularly a centre-forward - should be at the top of the manager's wishlist heading into 2026.",
      "There should be genuine concerns ahead of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad leaving for AFCON soon. Should Sesko be deemed unfit to return when Mbeumo and Amad leave, who does Amorim turn to then? Until this issue is addressed, United can expect to find goals difficult to come by.",

      "Ruben Amorim spoke to the media on Wednesday ahead of Manchester United's Premier League clash with West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim offered an update on the fitness of Matheus Cunha with the Brazilian back in training and available to face the Hammers.",
      "But United do have fresh injuries with two players doubts while Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire remain sidelined.",
      "Recap all the latest from Amorim's press conference below",
      "That's a wrap from Ruben. Here's the main headlines from what he had to say and from around United today.",
      "United have two fresh injury doubts for West Ham after cryptic Amorim answer",
      "What Amorim told Yoro after United reaction",
      "United stance on JJ Gabriel transfer as Barcelona step up interest",
      "It’s normal in any profession when you are exposed to it. I don’t read it, I protect myself.",
      "I don’t watch TV when they are talking about Manchester United. Not because I don’t agree, a lot of time I do, but it’s a way of me being healthy.",
      "My feeling as a coach is enough, I don’t need other feelings. The only way is protect myself. Of course I lose money from sponsors on Instagram, for my protection of my family and living a normal life is not worth some pounds.",
      "I protect myself and nobody can tough me more than me when we lose and when we don’t play well. Nowadays it’s really normal to have that abuse so it’s the only way to survive.",
      "Ruben Amorim has told Leny Yoro to stop beating himself up over mistakes, and revealed he had pulled the young centre-back aside after he showed his frustration in Manchester United's win at Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "Yoro conceded the penalty which allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta to open the scoring at Selhurst Park, before goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount saw United side roar back in the second half.",
      "Amorim took Yoro off during the celebrations for the equaliser, with Noussair Mazraoui already stripped and ready to come on. The 20-year-old showed his frustration as he was withdrawn and needed an arm around the shoulder from Mason Mount at full-time.",
      "That gesture was praised by Amorim, who revealed he had spoken to Yoro about his reaction to mistakes and also used this week to show him clips of positive elements from his performance at Selhurst Park to try and rebuild his confidence.",
      "Read more here",
      "I had no doubts he will have success. He’s really experienced, he knows how to work with different squads, understands really well the league.",
      "We know it’s going to be tough, he’s really smart preparing the games.",
      "The preparation is about the opponent but I’m focused on what we need to do and what we need to improve.",
      "He can do a lot of things better, like other players. When you see a very good game of Diogo he can show he has the quality, but sometimes he drops a little bit.",
      "He’s really powerful, he’s good on set-pieces, he can play both sides. To have that ability of playing both sides that can help you to think about the squad. He’s a very important player for us but he needs to improve like another player.",
      "Try to explain every day how to play, if you're comfortable and don’t have any doubts when you are playing that will help the kids.",
      "Then to work the physicality, the speed of the pressure, the moments to have the ball and pass the ball is completely different to U21s.",
      "He’ll have the chance, I don’t know, but he’s ready to play.",
      "It’s really important. I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake and then he struggles.",
      "He wants to do everything so well. He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",
      "He cannot show that to the people the way he came to the bench, he knows that. It shows he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game.",
      "He has more levels to go. He’s at a different club, different pressure, he was struggling because he was not scoring, he was thinking too much about the numbers but the influence he has in the team is important to us.",
      "Amorim confirms Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire remain out but Matheus Cunha is back.",
      "The United boss also says that two other members of his squad are doubts for the contest but didn't name them and will make a late call on their inclusion for the game against the Hammers.",
      "Read the full story here",
      "The Brazilian has been missing for the past few weeks with injury but has returned to training.",
      "That is a huge boost for United given striker Benjamin Sesko is also sidelined. Amorim will provide a more detailed update on the fitness of his squad shortly.",
      "Cunha hasn't featured since the draw with Spurs ahead of the international break.",
      "The United boss will be speaking just about now to the journalists in the room at Carrington.",
      "As ever, the press conference runs to a 15 minute embargo meaning we will be able to bring you the live quotes from 1.30pm.",
      "So stay tuned!",
      "There is a rare midweek Premier League outing for Manchester United this week as the busy Christmas period nears.",
      "United host West Ham United on Thursday night (8pm kick-off) and they go into the game in good spirits. Despite being 1-0 down at half-time, Ruben Amorim’s side came out as 2-1 winners against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The game against West Ham will now give the team chance to gain momentum and record back-to-back wins. United captain Bruno Fernandes had given United a slight injury scare in the closing stages of the game against Palace, but Amorim has confirmed that he had just been on the end of a kick and should be fine.",
      "The side have also been given another boost ahead of the clash against the Hammers with forward Matheus Cunha providing an update on his injury. Here’s a look at the latest from the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "This week presents a relatively unique experience for Manchester United, who for the first time since the end of August have a midweek game and a short turnaround between fixtures. The embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby further cleared an already quiet schedule for a team not in Europe this year, and United have benefited from the lack of midweek games to drill down into Ruben Amorim's plans on the training pitches at Carrington.",
      "They have played only 14 games this season, compared to the 20 contested by Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle. A gap of just four days between Sunday's win at Crystal Palace and Thursday's Old Trafford date with West Ham is unusual for a team that has become accustomed to the pattern of long lead-ins to games. They have had at least six days to prepare for every match since the start of September.",
      "However, the fixture list is arguably still kind to United, who will play six games in December.",
      "Read more here",
      "There was a nod to his teammates from Luke Shaw at Carrington on Tuesday as he was presented with a commemorative framed shirt to celebrate his 300th appearance for Manchester United, a milestone he might have never expected to reach during his lower moments at Old Trafford.",
      "Shaw's United career has often been one of survival. From spells where he has looked one of the best in the world in his position, to times when injuries have repeatedly struck him down and left him frustrated on the sidelines and a source of criticism from the stands.",
      "The 30-year-old has started every Premier League game this season and has developed into a senior statesman in this squad. He was presented with the shirt by director of football Jason Wilcox and head coach Ruben Amorim, before delivering a speech to the squad and first-team staff. That is something Amorim has introduced this season.",
      "Read more on the changing dressing room dynamic here",
      "Manchester United are confident of keeping hold of JJ Gabriel despite Barcelona stepping up their efforts to sign the academy starlet. The 15-year-old and his family have been guests of Barcelona at the Nou Camp on at least one occasion recently and were given a tour of the facilities as the Catalan club try and woo the United teenager.",
      "Their interest in Gabriel is long-standing. Gabriel has met Barcelona players during his visits to the Spanish city and it has been made clear that the club would like to bring him to their iconic La Masia academy at some point in the future. The England Under-16 international has long been talked about as one of the best talents to emerge from the United academy in recent seasons, but his goalscoring exploits for the Under-18s have seen him enter the wider consciousness this season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will speak to the media at 1.30pm today as he looks ahead of Thursday's Old Trafford clash with West Ham.",
      "We can expect an update on injuries with Matheus Cunha in contention to return to the squad against West Ham and there will also be an update on the availability of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo around the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Keep across this blog throughout the day for updates from Carrington."

      "What Amorim has said: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good. Matheus is back. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",

      "That is something Amorim has introduced this season, ensuring achievements are marked in the right manner, and it has become clear in recent weeks that the atmosphere in the dressing room is as strong as it has been for many years.",
      "Carrington insiders talk of how easy every player is to deal with and there has been a collective approach to things like media duties and community appearances this season. It may not be a coincidence that naturally quieter players, such as Shaw and Mason Mount, have found their voice. Shaw has helped Matheus Cunha settle in and has struck up a friendship with the Brazilian, while Mount is now bringing his experience to bear on the squad.",
      "It was noticeable that Sunday's matchwinner wrapped an arm around Leny Yoro at Selhurst Park on Sunday and Mount, having shunned media duties in his first couple of years at the club, has become an excellent talker off the pitch.",
      "The dressing room now feels a more level, meritocratic place. Some notable figures and personalities have left the club in recent years. Players such as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could bring the mood down and dominant personalities like Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo have gone.",
      "Despite the frequent turnover of managers in recent years at United, it is the players who have often faced scrutiny from supporters. That feels like it's changing this season and even if there are questions around the quality of some players, the idea that the dressing room is toxic or plotting behind the back of the manager has gone.",
      "That might be Amorim's biggest success so far. There are signs of progress on the pitch, but off it he has changed the culture and the environment at Carrington, which has been absolutely vital. He has been especially ruthless with players whom he considered to be a bad influence or who affected the mood of the dressing room, axing Rashford, Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho as a result.",
      "The benefits of that approach are now being seen. This feels like a squad on the same page and willing to stick together and that hasn't always been the case for Amorim's predecessors.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "The Glazers are ‘pushing’ for Ruben Amorim to replaced by another manager at Man Utd but INEOS want to keep him on, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd picked up three wins in a row in October with hope that Amorim could turn their fortunes around after a nightmare first year at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils’ 1-1 draw against West Ham means they are now eighth in the Premier League with European qualification a must for Amorim this season.",
      "The Glazer family handed Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS the reigns of the football operation when the British businessman bought 27.7 per cent of the club in February 2024.",
      "And now a reliable X account made up of ‘five elite reporters’ and 686k followers insists that the Glazers aren’t happy and want Man Utd boss Amorim replaced.",

      "READ: Man Utd fans left incensed by ‘muppet’ Amorim: ‘Get rid before he sells Mainoo’",

      "‘Tensions are high at @ManUtd, and the Glazers believe a new manager could turn things around. The Glazer family are the majority owners of the club, with minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s INEOS controlling the footballing side.",
      "‘However, they believe they need to step in regarding the manager’s future. A high level meeting is on the horizon, where they’ll need to resolve their differences and decide the future direction of the club. It’s a critical moment for Manchester United, and the pressure is mounting from the fans.’",
      "Amorim’s handling of Kobbie Mainoo has been questioned by Paul Scholes and others with former Man Utd defender Paul Parker claiming the England international must be “furious” with him.",
      "Parker told MyBettingSites: “I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake. He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup. He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.”",
      "“It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at McTominay. I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out. It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.”",
      "“He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",
      "Gary Neville felt the “real dejection” around Old Trafford on Thursday night as Man Utd were held to a 1-1 draw against West Ham in the Premier League.",

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is prepared to look for a loan move away from Old Trafford in January as he seeks regular minutes, according to reports.",
      "The England international has not started in the Premier League for Man Utd this term with Ruben Amorim preferring other players in midfield.",
      "Mainoo, who has been linked with a loan move to Napoli, has made nine appearances off the substitutes’ bench but his only start in all competitions came as Man Utd were knocked out of the League Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town earlier this year.",
      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "However, Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox managed to persuade Mainoo to fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",
      "There has been no progress on him getting minutes under Amorim and now The Athletic insists that Mainoo is ‘ready to seek a loan move away from Manchester United in January after becoming deeply frustrated about his lack of minutes’.",
      "READ: Man Utd fans left incensed by ‘muppet’ Amorim: ‘Get rid before he sells Mainoo’",
      "After being an unused subsitute in their 1-1 draw against West Ham on Thursday night, Mainoo seems to have made up his mind but The Athletic adds: ‘United are, however, expected to wait until after the African Cup of Nations finishes in the middle of the winter window to make a decision on Mainoo, given the uncertainty of how the tournament will impact Cameroon’s Bryan Mbeumo and the Ivory Coast’s Amad.’",
      "When asked on Thursday if he could understand why Mainoo’s lack of football was a talking point, Amorim replied: “Of course I understand. My job is to answer but I am trying to answer always the same thing. And you ask me always the same thing.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England, but that doesn’t mean I need to put Kobbie (on) when I feel I shouldn’t put Kobbie (on).”",
      "Amorim added: “I see it and I just want to win. I just put the players. I don’t look who it is, I don’t care about that, I just try to put the best players on the pitch.",
      "“You have (Manuel) Ugarte that played two games, one of them, (Casemiro) was out. Bruno (Fernandes) is always fit, he’s the guy that is doing (Mainoo’s) position so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "When asked if Mainoo’s prospects of getting into the starting XI would be improved when players depart for the Africa Cup of Nations later this month, Amorim said: “I don’t know. It’s the same question. I don’t know what is going to happen. It depends.",
      "“If I see in the training it is the best thing, I will put (him in). That is the only way I know how to respond to that.”",
      "Shea Lacey has been in Amorim’s last three squads but not come off the bench and when put to him whether he trusts the Man Utd academy players, Amorim continued: “Why? (I don’t pick) any players? We have (only) Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“When Bryan (Mbeumo) is not there, I put Amad because I have other wing backs to play and sometimes it’s hard. You are asking me why don’t I put Lacey to play when I have other guys that are international and they are also on the bench.",
      "“I try to put the best prepared guys for this moment of the club and try to win a game, that is the only thing guys.”",

And while the club have no desire to sell their prized asset mid-season, they are bracing themselves for formal approaches as early as the January transfer window for a player who first flagged up for United by former sporting director Dan Ashworth.",

      "READ: Man Utd fans left incensed by ‘muppet’ Amorim: ‘Get rid before he sells Mainoo’",
      "When asked about Mainoo, Amorim said last Friday: “I see him as a starter like the other players. I just have to make a choice and then in the end, it’s not been Kobbie.",
      "“In the future, I don’t know. Again, I always think the same thing with Casemiro. [He] was not playing and then he plays. I just want to win games. I don’t care who is playing.”",
      "And Man Utd legend Paul Scholes took to Instagram on Thursday night to air his frustration at Amorim’s treatment of Mainoo.",
      "Scholes posted in response to Amorim’s comments: “Bulls***. The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can’t control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave but it’s probably best for him now, enough is enough.”",
      "And now La Repubblica (via AreaNapoli), when outlining Napoli’s winter plans, claim: ‘Help from the market will certainly be needed, but Napoli will almost certainly only be able to operate on loan if the failure to comply with the ratio between revenue and extended labor costs (CLA), which must not exceed 0.8, is confirmed.",
      "‘This is why Kobbie Mainoo, 20, of United, is in pole position for Manna. The English are only considering a temporary transfer, as is the player, seeking playing time so as not to miss out on the World Cup showcase. Napoli hopes to be able to finalise everything within a couple of weeks. But in the meantime, the game is still on, and the Azzurri will do it in an emergency.’",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is prepared to look for a loan move away from Old Trafford in January as he seeks regular minutes, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has remarkably hit out at head coach Ruben Amorim, who has “ruined” one of the club’s most talented footballers.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has handed young defender Ayden Heaven his first league start of the season, leaving Kobbie Mainoo in some concerning company.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United will make a ‘U-turn’ on letting Kobbie Mainoo leave the club during the winter transfer window on one condition.",
      "Arsenal could make a January transfer window move to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, according to one respected journalist.",
      "Is this a “big, big few weeks” for the Manchester United star? The last two games suggests it will be more of the same."

      "On the reaction of the fans, Neville continued: “When we threw back to the studio and the camera stays in the stadium, and they’re picking up the faces of fans that are still sat in the actual seats, real, real dejection. Real dejection.",

Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper. But then came another clean sheet against Burnley.",

      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. Remarkably, conceding four against Aston Villa was bang on the PSxG for that game.",

      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheet v Bournemouth was more like it.",

      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper.

The clean sheet v Wolves was very, very welcome.",

I put it to the jury, it’s actually a reflection of how incredibly strong the standard of the league is now.",

It’s not just that my team are consistently inconsistent, I look at the fixture list now and can barely come up for air! Any team on their day will give you a game. Just look at how well the promoted teams can hold their own. Even Burnley – are you confident of your team going to Turf Moor and getting 3 points? Because I sure as shit am not!",
      "Oh you want some evidence and not just anecdotal ramblings of a mad man, you bunch of pedants? Look at how well English teams have been doing in Europe recently. Last season all 4 made it out of the group stages in the CL, with Arsenal and Villa going relatively deep. Spurs and Utd reached the final of the EL (can’t remember who won), and Chelsea breezed through the EC and won it. This season, Arsenal are flying in the CL with the other 4 teams in with a strong chance of qualifying; the same for the teams in the lesser comps (although Palace could be doing better to be fair).",
      "So why is this? Well there is obviously the money. Contrary to what slippery Puffy might have opined, mo money does not equal mo problems in football. Mo money in fact equals better players. However, something that has been nagging at me for years is that the main influence on the league is actually the standard of manager (or coaches) and the evolution of tactics.",

Or did the better coaches follow the better players or vice versa, like the old chicken and egg conundrum. But the influx of better coaches (typically foreign – they took our jobs Randy!) and ideas has really ramped up the standard of the league, and improved domestic coaching too.",

One approach that I can think of is to look at the average points per game so far this season of the teams that finished in the top 6 last season, and compared them to their average points per game over the whole of last season. Here is what I found:",

So, this measure, while inconclusive, does not really indicate that the League is weaker this season. What are other measures that people can suggest?\nNick",

      "…Ah Monty LFC in this morning’s mailbox wins the bitter fan bingo.",
      "‘….this shows how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season’",
      "Translation: my team is playing badly and can’t beat teams I consider weak or midtable so I’ll say it’s a low standard season.",
      "The alternative opposite view is the league is more competitive than it’s ever been. Currently there’s only 3 genuinely weak teams, but if you’re slightly off it against anyone else particularly away from home you’re liable to get turned over no matter who you are and no matter what perch you’ve toppled off.",
      "In Liverpool’s case the alternative view is also that they are incredibly lucky that so many good sides are taking points off each other to enable Liverpool to stay 1 win away from the Champions League places, as they certainly don’t deserve to be that close based on performances this season. Just think where Liverpool would be if they got the results their performances deserved in the first 5 games of the season!\nRich, AFC",

      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places, but they’re not going to finish in the top five of the Premier League if they don’t a) make some signings in January and b) win more than one game in a row.",
      "Will their finances allow a big spending spree in the winter transfer window? Probably not. Are we going to create a scenario where Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos spend around £250million? Yes. Absolutely.",
      "These five transfers would make for a perfect January for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, with a Liverpool hijack, Vinicius Junior and Mason Greenwood all thrown into the equation.",
      "",
      "It’s obvious that Manchester United need and want to sign a new central midfielder. The question is: who?",
      "If this was Career Mode or Football Manager, it would be one or two of Federico Valverde, Sandro Tonali, Declan Rice, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong or Moises Caicedo. But this is the real world. And in the real world, it’s going to be Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton. Which is still absolutely fine, by the way.",
      "Ruben Amorim is never shifting from his beloved 3-4-2-1 formation, so looking at previously successful English clubs operating in the same way, the Red Devils need a player like Nemanja Matic, N’Golo Kante or Jorginho. So it really isn’t all that simple. The best option, that also happens to be realistic, is Anderson.",
      "The Nottingham Forest star’s 2025/26 statistics put him up there as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. He has made 24 key passes (6th), 802 passes (5th), 111 progressive passes (1st), 111 ball recoveries (1st), 35 tackles (9th), 14 interceptions (23rd), won 29 fouls (2nd), and only received two yellow cards. And in Forest’s defeat to Brighton, Anderson became the first player in the last 10 Premier League seasons to record 100+ touches, 10+ ball recoveries, 10+ duels won, 5+ key passes and 5+ successful dribbles.",
      "He might not be Kante, but he could be Matic, and we’re confident he can become better than Jorginho, if he isn’t already.",
      "It would be a statement signing for Manchester United and there isn’t a better option out there among the players who would actually want to join. The fact he can do absolutely everything and has the engine to play midfield on his own makes him perfect for Amorim’s system. The only issue is the price. In January, you’re looking at £100m. In the summer, maybe closer to £80m. Better, but still very pricey. For England’s No.6, though? Probably worth it…",
      "",
      "Not only would Guehi massively improve United and walk straight in as a leader and their best defender, but signing him means Liverpool don’t, which is probably top of the list of positives, next to a blank column of negatives.",
      "There isn’t really much more to say about it. He would be an absolutely outstanding signing, but the odds are heavily stacked against United.",
      "Liverpool put all the groundwork into signing Guehi last summer and were hours away from getting it done, putting them comfortably ahead of the Red Devils in the race. He can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1, which gives Real Madrid a big advantage. They love a free transfer, need a centre-back and have dropped their interest in Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.",
      "But it’s still in United’s hands if they want it to be. Offer Palace £30m and they might struggle to reject it, considering he’s in the final six months of his deal. Just make a sufficient offer well before the deadline, lads.",
      "Liverpool are also in a much worse place than they were when Guehi agreed to join. They were reigning champions – and still are, technically – and looked set to dominate England and Europe after spending over £420m. Now they are mid-table, out of the title picture, and on an abysmal run of form. It’s not the place to be for someone like Guehi, though he could help fix the problem.",
      "And does Guehi even want to leave England? You’d have to ask him. Some players are reluctant to go abroad, especially if a top English club is offering a fat contract and guaranteed minutes. Real Madrid is the exception, though. You don’t turn down Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "It would be audacious to even try, and the noise surrounding Vinicius‘ situation at Real Madrid is probably a ploy to get a better contract. When he realises his only options are Manchester United or Saudi Arabia, he’ll likely return to Florentino Perez with his tail between his legs.",
      "But let’s say he actually does want to leave and refuses to renew. United would actually stand a chance. They are still, in the eyes of many, the biggest club in the world. They are an institution. Players are addicted to the idea of being ‘the one’ who finally fixes them after years of chaos.",
      "Out of all the big names United could chase, Vinicius would be the most ambitious and exciting. Leaving Real Madrid at 25, after being Ballon d’Or runner-up two years earlier, is not a normal career move. Joining United might be career suicide, but if anyone who is remotely gettable can single-handedly fix them, it’s Vinicius.",
      "",
      "Signing Anderson or Wharton, Guehi, and Vinicius is impossible without a significant sale or two. The best sale for everyone is Ugarte. Casemiro could work if the right offer arrives, but he’s actually been pretty good since Ruben Amorim came in. You could argue he’s been the Portuguese coach’s biggest success story so far. Then there’s Kobbie Mainoo, who is a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ pure profit option.",
      "Truth be told, only Saudi Arabia can bail Manchester United out when it comes to Ugarte. No Champions League contender will want him after back-to-back disappointing spells at two giant clubs. Sporting might want to re-sign him, but for nowhere near the £50m United paid Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. That leaves the filthy-rich Saudis, who will surely be interested in a big name like Ugarte, who is still only 24.",
      "It’s unrealistic, but not completely delusional. And United will only sanction his sale if they’ve already signed a new midfielder, or have one lined up.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules will probably still punish United anyway, but they can at least tell supporters they lived and enjoyed the dream while it lasted.",
      "",
      "Another significant windfall could come via the sale of Mason Greenwood from Marseille.",
      "Reports suggested United wanted to reintegrate Greenwood after his charges of attempted rape and assault were dropped, but after putting the feelers out, fan backlash was fierce. They quickly U-turned and pretended they always wanted to sell him. After a year on loan at Getafe, he joined Marseille for £26.7m, which was a low fee, but United’s hands were tied. In an uncharacteristically savvy move, they included a big sell-on clause, believed to be 50%.",
      "Transfermarkt says the 24-year-old is worth around £35m, but 10 goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season, coupled with his potential and previous seasons, suggests he will go for much more – perhaps around £60m, giving United £30m.",
      "And when Greenwood does leave Marseille, Manchester United will finally be able to close a dark chapter.",

      "‘Kane’s age, his hefty wages, and the length of his contract are all hurdles,’ they admit, but insist the Tottenham legend (another ‘hurdle’ they didn’t consider) is Enzo Maresca’s ‘dream target’ who can be ‘the difference-maker in Chelsea’s quest for the Premier League and Champions League titles’.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich\nAfter insisting Bayern only actually paid £11.8m as Jackson and his agent paid the rest, which is definitely actually a very good deal for a striker that would likely cost roughly £1m per goal based on his past goalscoring antics, Hoeness went on to explain why the conditions required to trigger the further £56m to make his loan deal permanent would “never” be met.",
      "“The big money only has to be paid if he starts 40 games. He never does that.”",
      "With just five starts to his name it doesn’t look hugely likely that clause will be met, but a Harry Kane injury or January move could do the trick.",
      "",
      "Michael Olise to Arsenal\nQuite why Arsenal are ‘prepared to submit a record-breaking offer close to €150m (£131m)’ for a guy who’s played 173 games in his career on the right wing when they already have Bukayo Saka and have just signed a very serviceable back-up in Noni Madueke, over signing someone for the left wing, where Olise has played just nine times, isn’t entirely clear.",

      "Lennart Karl to Manchester City\n“It’s like Monopoly: move forward to Schlossallee [the German Mayfair], then some sheikh will come along and then you can buy,” Hoeness said during his rant on Newcastle pinching Woltemade from under their noses.",
      "But there’s more than one sheikh in this multicultural haven (mainly featuring sheikhs and Americans) that we call the Premier League and you, Uli, will soon be forced to admit is The Greatest League In The World.",
      "With Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki you may be asking if City even need Karl, the 17-year-old superstar taking European football by storm, but then you are again missing the point. Need and want are very different things for the clubs able to provide for these players what Bayern aren’t: silly money.",

      "It’s thus absolutely “crucial” in order to push Hoeness over the edge that Manchester United sign him for £60m as the man to fill the midfield doughnut before his inevitable plunge into the pit of despair that’s claimed the last 427 players bought to plug that hole.",
      "",
      "Nico Schlotterbeck to Liverpool\nBayern have a rich, rich history of poaching the best Bundesliga centre-backs. Mats Hummels, Niklas Sule, Dayot Upamecano, Hiroki Ito and Jonathan Tah are the notable recent examples in the last decade.",

      "Dayot Upamecano to Tottenham\nRemains to be seen whether the first-choice France centre-back, widely regarded as one of the best in Europe who’s out of contract at the end of the season would be as on board as Tottenham in effecting this payback for Bayern’s free transfer acquisition of Eric Dier.",
      "",
      "Mike Maignan to Chelsea\nChelsea’s summer chase of Maignan appears to have lit a fire under Robert Sanchez, turning him into a strangely competent goalkeeper this season, but the Frenchman – seen by the Bayern powers-that-be as an ideal replacement for Manuel Neuer – will be a free agent in the summer and can take over the domestic cup role currently played by Filip Jorgensen and ahead of the dozen or so alternatives currently on the Blues books playing elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Jonathan Burkardt to West Ham\nAn absolute hammer blow to the sanity of Hoeness when the best striker in the Bundesliga not playing for Bayern Munich – ordinarily someone they would sign on a whim just so a rival can’t have them – opts for a Premier League club circling the relegation drain that’s famously the place where strikers go to die.",
      "Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick.",
      "Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk might have been given too much money and not enough motivation. Elsewhere, asterisk seasons and more.",

      "It’s all going on at Liverpool, with Mo Salah on his way to Saudi Arabia whether he likes or or not. But what would Sir Alex do?",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma looks like a massive boy lost at Manchester City at the moment; he’s no Dean Henderson, that’s for sure.",
      "A key Premier League title clash has snuck up on us all to the extent that it’s on Saturday lunchtime instead of Sunday afternoon like it should be."

      "Manchester United are running out of turning points.",
      "They can’t keep taking one step forward and then two steps back, and that’s the incredibly unsexy dance they performed once again in their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham after beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "That was a huge win, an unexpected win, against a very good team. They had to back that up with another win against a pretty poor one. Alas, they didn’t.",
      "Ruben Amorim should be criticised for his substitutions, which ultimately cost them victory on Thursday night. He even managed to spark debate with his starting XI.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made the bold call to hand young defender Ayden Heaven his first start of the season, with Matthijs de Ligt – the club’s player of the month – out due to a minor injury. Heaven didn’t come in for De Ligt, but for Leny Yoro, whose dropping to the bench was a “tactical” decision.",
      "Heaven needed to settle quickly, and he did the opposite, smashing into Jarrod Bowen with a slide tackle and receiving a yellow card after only eight minutes. Not ideal, but it clearly didn’t rattle him because he didn’t have a poor first half. Still, he evidently wasn’t good enough in Amorim’s eyes as he was substituted at half-time for Yoro, with the booking clearly concerning the Portuguese.",
      "Heaven starting on Thursday reaffirmed what we already knew: Kobbie Mainoo is in Man United exile.",
      "After emerging as one of the club’s best players under Erik ten Hag, becoming an England regular and starting in the final of Euro 2024, Mainoo can’t get a kick anymore, and a January sale is looking more likely with every passing week.",
      "Another appearance on the bench while Heaven was in the starting XI left Mainoo in worrying company with Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia as United’s only first-team players yet to start in the Premier League this season. If you were unsure, that’s their third-choice goalkeeper, a guy who has been injured all season, and someone who was in Amorim’s pre-season bomb squad.",
      "While his standing in the Red Devils’ squad hierarchy is striking, it’s not like he’d have transformed a cautious United performance.",
      "Amorim has said that he’s competing for a starting spot with club captain and best player Bruno Fernandes, and from the minor minutes we’ve seen of them together, it actually makes sense. But for Mainoo, it’s a horrible situation; Fernandes is literally undroppable. His form needs to fall off a cliff to be benched, and he’s only missed nine Premier League games in five full seasons, largely due to suspension.",
      "Casemiro has also been pretty good in midfield for the Red Devils and is Amorim’s biggest success story. He has been criticised for his rashness in the past, but he is more disciplined in that position than Mainoo.",
      "Man United fans are desperate to see Mainoo play more because they love him and he’s an academy graduate with incredible potential, but during a disappointing performance against West Ham, there can’t have been many people watching and thinking the game was crying out for him.",
      "Their performance made for a very dull first half at Old Trafford, highlighted largely by Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s defensive contributions.",
      "The first genuine moment of quality came from Alphonse Areola, who acrobatically tipped Bryan Mbeumo’s cross-cum-shot over the bar, denying United another set-piece goal that would have seen them overtake Arsenal in that statistic in the 2025/26 Premier League season.",
      "In terms of attacking quality, that was really all she wrote in the opening 45 minutes. There was a brief flurry of shots that could have sparked Ruben Amorim’s men into life; Wan-Bissaka cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off the line, Matheus Cunha had an overhead kick blocked, and Bruno Fernandes’ scissor volley clipped the post. It wasn’t the shot in the arm United needed, just three shots.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was player of the half, adding an incredible sliding tackle on Cunha in his own box before producing an expertly read headed clearance from a tantalising Fernandes cross.",
      "It was unfortunately much of the same when the game restarted, but in a match between two teams that can be excruciating to watch that was crying out for a goal, we finally got one just before the hour mark, and in fairness, it did improve proceedings.",
      "Diogo Dalot benefited from a bit of luck when Casemiro’s blocked shot fell straight to him, though he still had plenty to do. His first touch was perfect and the finish was that of an experienced No.9, shifting the ball past Wan-Bissaka and in the opposite direction of Areola’s momentum.",
      "Beating West Ham at home was the only acceptable outcome for United, and going up into the Champions League places would’ve been a welcome bonus. But after taking the lead, they didn’t push for a second, and as the second didn’t come and their opponents found an equaliser, Amorim’s substitutions will rightly be criticised.",
      "Patrick Dorgu on for the goalscorer, Manuel Ugarte for Matheus Cunha, and Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee suggested that Amorim thought it had to be a case of holding onto the one-goal lead rather than pressing on against one of the worst teams in the Premier League this year and putting the game to bed.",
      "Ironically, when Nuno Espírito Santo brought on Andy Irving, his first contribution was to instantly take a corner kick that led to Soungoutou Magassa’s 83rd-minute equaliser.",
      "United might feel aggrieved that Wan-Bissaka wasn’t shown the most blatant of second yellow cards you’ll see all season, but the fact of the matter is that they didn’t do nearly enough to win the game. Areola wasn’t tested enough and any half-chance they did get was rashly wasted, like Fernandes’ left-footed volley in the fifth minute of injury time.",
      "There was a serious lack of quality at Old Trafford. It was just a bad game of football. The United players looked dejected at the end, knowing it was an unacceptable performance and that West Ham at home should have been an easy three points.",
      "Questions will be asked about Amorim’s in-game management again. It cost United and epitomises their season so far: one step forward, two steps back. Just when you think they could get back amongst it, they do something stupid. It’s tiring for us, let alone someone who actually goes to the games.",
      "It’s bottom-club Wolves next. Another team in the relegation zone. No matter how poor they are, United can’t relax and act as if the game is won at 1-0. Or, knowing this team, even at 2-0.",
      "Amorim’s substitutions were so negative that they rubbed off on his players, who seemed to think it was game over and that they could just see it out. Nope. West Ham can still punish you. Even Wolves can still punish you.",
      "United can’t become too casual in these fixtures. They cannot follow an impressive win at Palace with a poor draw at home to West Ham. And we can’t keep looking at games and saying afterwards, ‘Well, Amorim will learn from this.’",
      "It’s clear that this team still has a long way to go. They’ve taken a step forward and a step back so many times they no longer have any idea which way they’re facing.",

      "“Both Mbeumo and Amad are going, and Mazraoui behind them, so its the entire right-hand side going away for at least a month.",
      "“It could have a real big impact on their season if they’re not prepared, and the manager feels the squad is light in those areas, so something will have to be done.",
      "“Semenyo is the one they’ve been looking at, because Ghana didn’t qualify for AFCON.",
      "“It looks like he will be available in January because of that release clause in his contract, that’s why there are a few clubs having a look at him.",
      "“But United need to spend in January to improve the squad, and he’s somebody they wanted to bring in during the summer before he signed that contract.",
      "“If the opportunity comes up when the window opens, it would make a lot of sense because he would also be able to plug that hole left by Mbeumo.”",
      "And reports in Spain claim that Man Utd are ‘prepared to offer over €150m (£131m) to try and lure Vinicius Junior or Fede Valverde away from Real Madrid’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "Valverde is seen by the Red Devils hierarchy as ‘an absolute priority to rebuild the team and return it to the top of the table’ and are ‘prepared to offer a significant portion of their €150m-plus asking price for him’.",
      "Man Utd believe that if Vinicius Junior – who could also cost around €150m – ‘doesn’t sign a contract extension, there’s a window of opportunity to try and sign him’ and reckon ‘a stratospheric offer could open up unexpected negotiations with Los Blancos.’",

      "Ruben Amorim’s side needed a response after the defeat to Everton and certainly found one. The Red Devils ended Palace’s 12-match unbeaten home run with goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount.",
      "It was a much-needed show of control away from home, keeping them in touch with the pack above. A win v West Ham would take them into the top five.",
      "West Ham arrive after a setback of their own. A three-game unbeaten run was halted by Liverpool, with Lucas Paqueta’s red card leaving Nuno’s side fighting uphill for most of the contest.",

      "Goals feel more reliable than either side’s form. United’s new-look attack is dangerous, but there are still massive question marks over their defence.",
      "On the other hand, West Ham scored three times in back-to-back games prior to a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool. Even in defeat, the Hammers find the net more often than not.",
      "Jarrod Bowen remains their biggest threat on the ball. He’s scored in consecutive meetings with Man Utd and is priced at 7/4 to score or assist.",
      "At the other end, Fernandes is producing again. His deliveries changed the game at Palace, and he has assisted in four of his last six league matches.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo may be scoring the goals, but the Hammers are so vulnerable to set-piece deliveries that Fernandes to score or assist looks obvious at 7/10.",
      "If that price is a bit skinny, you can always pair the two.",
      "Man Utd to win and both teams to score at 7/4 is the standout bet. Amorim’s side have won despite conceding in five of 11. Seven West Ham matches have produced a winner and goals from both teams."

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for a Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more.",

      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",

      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances which now incredibly sees Frank-less Brentford above Frank’s Tottenham.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton, though.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But , well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs went to Newcastle – and got a barely deserved draw – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ and a rare home win over Chelsea does anything more than delay the inevitable.",
      "The Glazers are ‘pushing’ for Ruben Amorim to replaced by another manager at Man Utd but INEOS want to keep him on, according to reports.",

Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton have also been mentioned as targets.",

      "“You can leave them out of the side and the rest of the squad can cope. But when you have three or four players who are really talented, but just aren’t at the races, then it drags the team down a level.”",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",

In their last 10 Premier League matches without the Brazilian, Arsenal have shipped seven set piece goals and allowed opposition sides to generate around three shots per game from dead-ball situations.",
      "For a team that usually prides itself on control and organisation, that's a sizeable drop-off.",

      "If Villa get the dead-ball volume right, Arsenal could be in for a tough afternoon. In a low scoring game both centre-backs Ezri Konsa and Pau Torres are live outsiders to score the first goal at 40/1 the pair with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth's defeat to Everton was the worst performance in Andoni Iraola's tenure for my money. If you didn't know who the manager was there was no way you'd have guessed that was an Iraola team.",
      "It lacked all the core principles he demands from a football team: forward passing, tempo, pressing and intent. His team are in a sticky patch. It's now four defeats in their last five and 13 goals conceded in that run.",
      "Iraola is such a genius, he'll get it right and start to find a formula again but his football is all about bravery and playing with conviction and confidence, so when a couple of players start to take a step back it can make the whole structure very easy to play against. Chelsea may just find that here and look a slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet to win.",
      "When Sean Dyche and David Moyes football teams clash, the goals tend to pack their bags and take the night off. Yes, I pretended to be shocked too.",
      "Their philosophies overlap one another: slow the game down where possible, deny space, win duels, control territory and squeeze matches into low-margin battles. Both guys are friends to the under goals bettor.",
      "Across the last 15 head-to-head meetings between Moyes-led and Dyche-led sides, only 10 goals have been scored - that's 1.5 goals per game - with six of those fixtures going under 1.5 goals.",
      "It's 2/1 with Sky Bet for the game to go under that line again.",
      "If there is ever a weekend where the Premier League rips up the script and shocks are live, it's this one - the first Gameweek after a December midweek schedule. Legs are heavy, rotations get messy, and the supposedly \"banker\" odds-on favourites suddenly look nothing of the sort.",
      "The last 15 teams who have gone off odds-on in this exact Gameweek over the past several seasons have all failed to win by more than one goal. Not one has justified the price. Manchester City are part of that sample size when scraping past Luton 2-1 in the 23/24 season despite going off 1/9 to win the match.",
      "And this week, City, still juggling rotations, searching for defensive cohesion and the allure of Real Madrid on the horizon, may just walk straight into the trap.",

      "This is a very different version of Kyle Walker to the one we saw at Manchester City. At Burnley, he's defending far more often, in far more open spaces and the numbers show exactly how much strain that's putting on his aging limbs.",
      "And that strain is turning into fouls. Lots of them.",
      "Walker has made 16 fouls in his last 10 games. And few wingers in the league attack defenders with as much tempo and directness as Anthony Gordon.",
      "He's drawing 2.7 fouls per 90 minutes in the Premier League this season, elite numbers for a wide attacker, and he loves driving hard at full backs.",
      "Walker to make two or more fouls again is overpriced at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "If the footballing gods have a sense of humour - and they do have previous - then Thomas Frank facing a Brentford side led by the set piece coach that Frank hired at Brentford, feels like a script already half-written.",
      "Frank left Brentford as the man who helped embed a set piece philosophy that became the envy of the league. Now he's in the opposite dugout with his new side still ironing out lots of flaws, this looks made for Keith Andrews to conjure up some set-piece mastery.",
      "Football is a funny old game and one of Nathan Collins (12/1 with Sky Bet) or Sepp van den Berg (11/) to score would tickle me and betting balance.",
      "If you collate the numbers since Daniel Farke switched to a 5-3-2 in the second half against Manchester City, Leeds have won the aggregate score against Manchester City and Chelsea by 5-2. For someone who has received lots of stick for not being able to be flexible enough, he's silenced that noise in a big way.",
      "And after feeling like the walls were closing in on Farke, Leeds now head into this Liverpool game with belief and momentum. Elland Road will be looking at this as another free swing type of night where ruffling some Liverpool feathers and having a go just might be enough to wobble the Reds off their game again.",
      "As one thing we have learned from the past week is that beating West Ham does NOT mean your crisis is over. Leeds on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looks a fantastic bet to attack.",
      "Freddie Potts has made a big impression since stepping into the West Ham midfield, adding much needed steel, aggression and tenacity to an area that was lacking under Graham Potter. The midfielder has been fouled eight times in his last four starts and across his last 31 club starts he's averaging 1.8 fouls won per-game.",
      "Only three teams have made more fouls since the start of last season than Brighton, who play a very high-tempo and aggressive game in midfield. Potts to be fouled at least twice at 5/4 with Sky Bet is a tasty prop to attack.",
      "This is usually part of the season where Marco Silva's team find rhythm and are peak performance level. Whilst other teams, like Crystal Palace, are flagging due to fighting on multiple fronts, Silva's team play with an added edge. In the period after the final international break and Boxing Day, Silva has a Premier League win strike-rate of 52 per cent from 19 matches. That's a huge figure for a club with the expectations of Fulham.",
      "One of their wins that has slipped under the radar was their 1-0 win over Sunderland at home. The metrics behind that win were so strong, winning the expected goals battle 2.16-0.17 and posting 24 shots, 18 of which came from inside the box. They dominated a team who have proved to be a very difficult opponent for Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool this season.",
      "And Palace are a team to bet against when the time is right during this hectic period. This is their fifth game in 16 days and Oliver Glasner has made the fewest changes to Premier League starting XI's this season (12). Palace are a fantastic team but this group can't keep going to the well and performing at the highest level. Fulham to win at 8/5 with Sky Bet does the job.",
      "Hold your breath, Wolves fans, this isn't going to be pretty.",
      "Wolves have joint-fewest points (2) after 14 games by any team in a top division season and have lost their last seven Premier League games, going 495 minutes without a goal. Rob Edwards has got the same amount of bounce as throwing a brick on the floor.",
      "But in football, these runs don't last forever. They snap. And when they do, it's often in a fixture where the market has started to write the goal-shy side off.",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "The AFCON deadline is around the corner for Premier League clubs to release their players for the month-long tournament in Morocco. Who will lose the most players to the competition, and what games could they miss?",
      "Players are required to report to north Africa on December 15, with the tournament kicking off six days later when hosts Morocco face Comoros. However, with Man Utd playing Bournemouth that evening, there is the potential for exceptions to be made.",
      "The final will be held in Rabat almost a month later on January 18, meaning it could be a long Christmas and New Year period for some Premier League sides without a number of key players",
      "Whose squads will be hit the hardest, who has the toughest fixture schedule across that period and who doesn't have anything to worry about at all?",
      "Most nations are yet to announce their final squads but going by recent selection and injury status, here's the realistic scenario for how many players each Premier League club could lose to the tournament...",
      "Of the 458 players used in the Premier League, 45 have been from the African continent - with Sunderland the most reliant on their ranks. All seven of their African players arrived in the summer, and all seven look set to be called up to their respective squads for AFCON.",
      "No surprise, then, that Sunderland have also had the highest percentage of minutes played by African players since their promotion, more than 10 per cent than the next closest, Wolves - who look set to lose four to AFCON this month.",
      "There are no worries for Arsenal, Chelsea, Leeds and Newcastle who haven't been represented by a single African player between them this season - and will not see their squads impacted by the tournament.",
      "Sunderland might have given almost a third of their playing minutes to African players but given all of their three attacking signings have struggled for minutes, they find themselves well down the list of goals and assists across the Premier League this season.",
      "Instead, Fulham lead the way on that front, not least after Samuel Chukwueze's double and Alex Iwobi's finish in their pulsating 5-4 defeat to Man City.",
      "Individually, no African player has contributed more to his side's attacking output than Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, piquing further interest from Premier League suitors ahead of a potential January transfer - when a new release clause will come into being, albeit only briefly.",
      "Whether he stays or goes, for the moment Bournemouth will be happy to keep their flying forward at the Vitality Stadium for the next month, with Ghana finishing bottom of their qualifying group and missing out on AFCON for the first time since 2004.",
      "On paper at least, Aston Villa have the hardest set of fixtures across the six Premier League rounds played during AFCON.",
      "Man Utd are slated to have the easiest, facing both Wolves and Burnley, ranked 20th and 19th, in that time.",
      "Sunderland, the team losing the most players to the competition, have the triple whammy of facing Man City, Brighton and Crystal Palace across the month.",
      "Man Utd play Bournemouth on Monday Night Football on December 15, after the deadline for clubs to release their players for AFCON.",
      "The club have been in talks over extending that deadline for their three affected players - Noussair Mazraoui, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo - to feature in that game, but it is still not clear whether that will be possible.",
      "Speaking ahead of their game with Wolves, Ruben Amorim was asked if he had received any clarification about when he may lose the trio and replied: \"No, with everything, They are going to play the next game [at Molineux] and that is the only thing I care [about].\"",

      "Ayden Heaven, making his first start since the debacle against Grimsby, was withdrawn at half-time having picked up an early booking, but the United boss maintained his 3-4-3 structure, of course. And it was his left wing-back of all people who opened the scoring.",
