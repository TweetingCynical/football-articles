      "Jadon Sancho was quick to heap praise on former Manchester United team-mate Antony after the Brazilian netted a late equaliser for Real Betis in their Europa League clash with Nottingham Forest. Antony made a triumphant return to Betis following a successful loan stint there last season, sealing a permanent move in the closing stages of the summer transfer window.",
      "Since his full-time switch to Spain, the Brazilian has featured in both league matches and bagged his first goal against Ange Postecoglou's side on Wednesday night. In the 15th minute, Antony demonstrated his creative prowess by setting up Cedric Bakambu's opening goal.",
      "Despite Igor Jesus putting Forest ahead with two goals within five minutes, Antony emerged as the hero of the night for Manuel Pellegrini's squad. He scored a well-executed equaliser in the 85th minute.",
      "Sancho, who also left the United 'bomb squad' over the summer, was among those excluded from Ruben Amorim's team and had to train separately from the main squad alongside Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. The winger joined fellow Premier League side Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season.",
      "On social media, Sancho captured Antony's late equaliser against Forest and posted: \"Hermano! *fire emoji* *clapping hands emoji\". 'Hermano' is Spanish for brother.",
      "Antony has since replied to the message. Reposting Sancho's response, he added in a caption reading \"High foot\", along with eyes, and laughing and red heart emoji, he also tagged both Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Antony's European exploits for Betis follow his instrumental role in guiding them to the Conference League final last season. He netted four times and provided three assists before falling at the final hurdle to Sancho's Chelsea.",
      "Betis made a concerted effort to sign Antony during the summer transfer window, with the deal appearing to be off at one stage. A potential move to Saudi Arabia was rumoured, but it was consistently reported that Betis was his preferred choice.",
      "His start with the Spanish side since completing a permanent move has been slow with no goal contributions in his first two La Liga games. Antony will hope that the equaliser against Forest will now kickstart his season.",
      "Real Betis are back in action on Sunday when they take on Osasuna in La Liga (8pm kick-off).",
      "They are next in European action on Thursday, 2 October when they travel to take on Ludogorets (5.45pm kick-off).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Antony continues to rebuild his reputation following his Manchester United exit. The Spanish press had high praise for his latest display against Nottingham Forest in the Europa League, with it even being labelled as a skipper's performance minus only the armband.",
      "The Brazilian rescued a crucial point for Real Betis against Ange Postecoglou's Forest in Europe. The Premier League side held a 2-1 advantage at the break despite conceding early on, and appeared destined to claim three points in their first game of the league phase.",
      "However, Antony emerged at the far post during the 85th minute and saved Manuel Pellegrini's side from embarrassment on home soil. Spanish outlets celebrated the 25-year-old's wing play, as he earned widespread praise for securing a dramatic late equaliser.",
      "Betis Web praised Antony for refusing to \"give up in a match against some real beasts.\" Accompanying their 7/10 rating, they even tipped him for a future captaincy role as they said: \"He didn't care [who he was facing]; his courage and attitude kept the team going. Today he was the captain without the armband.\"",
      "Marca admitted that Betis ultimately deserved the draw against Forest, with Antony's strike providing a crucial late reward against \"one of the most powerful rivals they will face.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Estadio Deportivo hailed the winger as the hero of Betis' encounter that proved a \"rollercoaster of emotions and chances.\"",
      "This local reaction demonstrates the Brazilian's commitment to rediscovering his best form since departing United. The £80million star lost his place at Old Trafford following his arrival from Ajax in 2022, but has undoubtedly re-established himself in Spain.",
      "Antony secured a permanent switch to Betis in a deal worth £19m, following a successful loan spell last season. After the match, the winger confessed that recent months had been exhausting but expressed satisfaction with the match outcome.",
      "He said: \"Tired. The last three months have been very difficult for me. I've been training with the team for two weeks now, and it's still a bit difficult, but here at home, with our fans, we wanted the three points.",
      "\"We have to move on; we have another game on Sunday.\" Team-mate Pablo Fornals echoed the Spanish press's sentiments, insisting that Antony will rediscover his peak form with Betis.",
      "He said: \"In almost every interview, the question is the same; if it's not about him, it's about Isco. They're very important players.",
      "\"He has a balance that any of us who've played on the wing would love. It's important that he's fit, that he gradually gets back to the rhythm he had last year. Today, yet another day, he's shone again.\"",

      "Manchester United have reportedly identified two potential alternatives to Carlos Baleba, should they fail to strike a deal with Brighton.",
      "The Red Devils initially expressed their interest in the midfielder during the summer transfer window, but were met with a firm response from the Seagulls.",
      "Brighton had no intention of parting ways with the player, and would only entertain offers in the region of the £115 million they pocketed from the sale of Moises Caicedo to Chelsea back in 2023. This led United to abandon any potential deal.",
      "United could, of course, rekindle their interest when the January transfer window swings open, hoping that Brighton might soften their stance. However, it appears that the club are already exploring potential alternative options.",
      "Both players have made their way into the England squad over the past year. Anderson started both of the Three Lions' matches during the recent international break, impressing with his performances in the number six role.",
      "He has also turned heads since making the move to Nottingham Forest from Newcastle United last summer. His performances played a key role in helping his club secure European football this season.",
      "Wharton has also been instrumental in his club's success, being a member of the Palace squad that hoisted the FA Cup last season.",
      "United are not anticipated to be the sole club eyeing up the pair when the transfer window swings open in the new year, with Manchester City also reportedly showing interest in Wharton.",

      "Joe Cole believes Elliot Anderson's time at Nottingham Forest will only last so long with the midfielder tipped to take another step forward in his career. The England new boy made another stellar impression on the European stage as his side were held by Real Betis.",
      "Forest were denied the win in Spain by a late Antony equaliser, but the former Newcastle star still showcased his quality in the middle of the park. Anderson has continued to take huge strides forward and excelled as the Nottingham outfit secured European football last term.",
      "Manchester United are among those linked with him as they look to address their flaws in that midfield area.",
      "Anderson's exploits caught the attention of Thomas Tuchel and the Forest man recently made his debut for the Three Lions. That came after a summer where he helped the U21s defend their title at the Euros.",
      "Cole is now backing the 22-year-old to feature for England at the World Cup next summer, picking out qualities in his game that make him a must have, and insists his rise will likely see him leave Forest.",
      "\"I've watched him many times, I see something in him, he's a winner. There was a moment at the U21 Euros when he was dropped for a game and then he come on and scored the penalty and there was an anger in his face. There's a belief in him, the way he goes into tackles.",
      "\"And I think as a player I'd want Anderson in my team next to me, and I think Tuchel sees that, I think he's put himself in pole position. If he keeps playing like he is tonight, if he keeps on at his trajectory, the sky is the limit for the kid.\"",
      "Anderson's ability to dictate play in midfield is likely to make him hugely sought after. He moved to Nottingham from Newcastle for £35million but his current employers could command double that if he was to move on.",
      "Tuchel is tasked with making England champions of the world and the German has hailed Anderson's attributes after his debut in white recently.",
      "“He’s just a very, very good football player,\" he said. \"He has the physicality, he’s very mobile at No 6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to duels.",
      "\"He loves passing, he loves to break the lines, he’s very mobile in this game. It was a pleasure to see.\"",

      "Manchester United are ready to let three expensive Erik ten Hag transfer flops walk for nothing - to help kickstart the Ruben Amorim era.",
      "The United boss replaced Ten Hag in 2024, inheriting a bloated squad filled to the brim with underperforming, expensive stars. That has contributed to a miserable first 12 months for Amorim, who has picked up just nine wins from his 32 Premier League matches in charge.",
      "Amorim managed to move on a number of high-profile players during the summer window, with Alejandro Garnacho and Antony leaving permanently. There were also loan moves for Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Andre Onana and Jadon Sancho - all of whom are unlikely to continue their Old Trafford careers next year.",
      "And the Sun report that more players will be shown the exit door in 2026, to help free up funds for a big midfield signing. United opted to spend heavily on attacking reinforcements this time around, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arriving for a combined fee of more than £200m.",
      "That did mean that other areas were not improved upon, most notably at the heart of their midfield. There were huge calls for a new central midfield player to be added to help the implementation of Amorim’s strict 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United were heavily linked with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, but despite exploratory talks, a deal was deemed too expensive. The Seagulls value the Cameroon international at £115m and would be the marquee signing of next summer’s window.",
      "The Sun report that United bosses are ready to sanction another swathe of big-name exits, to help slash the wage bill before another splurge in the transfer market. Casemiro would lead that departure list with the 33-year-old set to become a free agent at the end of the current season.",
      "The Brazilian has been a regular both under Ten Hag and Amorim, but after a fantastic first season, has struggled to replicate that form. He has remained a regular under Amorim, but showed his limitations with a damaging red card in the recent win over Chelsea.",
      "United signed Casemiro for £70m from Real Madrid in 2022 and remains one of the club’s highest earners. The Red Devils do retain an option to extend his current contract for a further year, but he now looks increasingly likely to be leaving on a free.",
      "Sancho was an even more expensive misfire by the previous regime, signing for £73m in the same summer as Casemiro. He has failed to play a league match for United in over two years, spending much of that time away on loan.",
      "He is currently attempting to rebuild his career with Aston Villa, but will be a free agent next July - with United unlikely to trigger the 12-month option in his deal.",
      "And Tyrell Malacia is another almost certain to move on having been the only member of Amorim’s ‘bomb squad’ not to secure a summer exit.",
      "The left-back was signed for £13m, becoming Ten Hag’s first signing but has endured a torrid time with injuries. He looked certain to be leaving during the most recent window, but saw a move to Turkey collapse.",
      "Like Casemiro and Sancho, he will be able to leave on a free next year. But one player looking increasingly likely to STAY with United is former captain Harry Maguire.",
      "The England international became the world ’s most expensive defender when he arrived from Leicester in 2019. And despite falling out of favour under Ten Hag, has the backing of his current head coach.",
      "United triggered a contract extension earlier this year to keep him under terms for this season and now hope to tie him down to a longer contract - albeit on lesser terms.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wayne Rooney has admitted that his time at Birmingham City was an 'absolute car crash', pinpointing the exact moment he knew that it would not work out at St Andrews. Following the culmination of his playing career, Rooney went into management but found it difficult to replicate his playing successes in the dugout.",
      "Derby County, DC United and Plymouth Argyle all employed Rooney. But it was the former Manchester United, Everton and England striker spell at Birmingham under their American ownership which ended in the worst possible manner.",
      "In just shy of three months, Rooney managed to win only two matches and he was quickly sacked at the beginning of January having not been given the opportunity to sign a single player of his own. In a sit-down interview with former United teammate Rio Ferdinand on his 'Rio Ferdinand Presents' YouTube channel, the 39-year-old admitted that the spell in the West Midlands was particularly bad",
      "\"I think I took very difficult jobs,\" Rooney said. \"Obviously, I was at Derby [as a player] and then I went in as manager and then they went in administration.",
      "\"Then I went out to the US and managed DC United, which people actually think and talk about that as if it was a big failure. DC United finished bottom the three seasons before I went in, and then we missed out on playoffs by a point, and then when I left, they went back to the bottom and people don't talk about that.",
      "\"Then I went to Birmingham, which was an absolute car crash from day one, to be honest. The fans never said that.",
      "\"I remember we played Middlesbrough away in the first game, we lost 1-0 in the 90th minute. Then we played Hull at home.",
      "\"I remember I walked out and my first game at home, and I'm stood there, and the players are shaking hands and I'm over there. And there was a Birmingham fan behind me: 'Get back to America, you fat c***.'",
      "\"I turned around, I was laughing. I turned around, I was like, 'give me a chance'.",
      "\"And so that was just never right at the time of when I went in. It was just never... It weren't a good fit.\"",
      "Rooney's comments come after Birmingham co-owner Tom Brady questioned his work ethic in the dugout. Speaking on the Amazon Prime documentary Brady & The Blues: Birmingham City which released last month, the NFL icon was filmed saying to business manager Ben Rawitz: “I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic.\"",
      "After being sacked from his most recent role at Plymouth on New Year's Eve, Rooney's attention has been drawn away from management. The former striker now appears to be focusing on a career in punditry after joining the freshly revamped Match of the Day.",
      "He also features in a BBC podcast - The Wayne Rooney Show - alongside Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd. He has also appeared on the Stick to Football podcast alongside his ex-United teammates Gary Neville and Roy Keane while also joining Amazon Prime's coverage of the Champions League.",

Being knocked out of the EFL Cup already and not partaking in European football this season means Ruben Amorim's men will have had a week's break by the time they take on Brentford on Saturday.",
      "The Premier League clash at the Gtech Community Stadium follows the recent action-packed win at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. United made the extra man count following goalkeeper Robert Sanchez's early red card for the Blues, before Casemiro himself was sent off on the stroke of half-time.",
      "Harry Kane could make his return to the Premier League next summer due to a reported secret clause in his contract. The England captain joined Bayern Munich two years ago and remains under contract until June 2027.",
      "But German outlet Bild reports Kane could be available for a cut-price of £56.7million next year, provided that he informs Bayern of his decision to leave before the end of the January transfer window. Such a request would come as a surprise given Kane has settled in well in Bavaria, winning the first trophies of his career and already scoring eight goals this season.",
      "But a return to the Premier League after the 2026 World Cup, at which point he will be 33 years old, would give him the chance to break Alan Shearer’s record as the English top flight’s all-time leading goal scorer.",
      "United, having tried to sign Kane in the past, could be keen to snap up the former Spurs star, despite Amorim's revamp of his attacking line-up with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. They may also face competition from Tottenham, given their first-option agreement from when they facilitated Kane's transfer to Germany in 2023.",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller has admitted he would love to take on the Manchester United job. The 44-year-old has enjoyed a growing reputation in Germany for his work with the Bundesliga side, having led them to the Champions League.",
      "Premier League fans may know him as the head coach that managed to get the best out of Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom sealed big money moves to the English top flight this year. And Toppmoller has suggested he wouldn’t turn down a move to United if he was offered Amorim’s job.",
      "“Basically, it’s a dream to be at Eintracht now,” he said, as per Bild. “It’s simply a fantastic club. Here, as a teenager, I witnessed for the first time that my father was a Bundesliga coach. That naturally creates an emotional bond with a club.",
      "“Thinking about abroad, I often played computer games as a child, always with one team: Manchester United. That would definitely be nice someday, because it’s an extraordinary club.",
      "“When I was a teenager, Manchester United was, along with Real Madrid, the biggest club of all.”",
      "The manager received a big money offer to join Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad in the summer, which he rejected. And he is already familiar with Manchester, should he replace the under the pressure Amorim at Old Trafford, having joined Manchester City on loan in 2001 - though he did not make an appearance for the club.",

      "Antony was Real Betis' inspiration as the Spanish side held Nottingham Forest to a 2-2 draw in the Europa League on Wednesday night. Ange Postecoglou's side dominated proceedings in Seville, but were denied victory by Antony's equaliser.",
      "Antony left Manchester United in a £21.65million permanent deal on transfer deadline day, having enjoyed himself on loan in Spain last season. While he flopped following an £82m transfer from Ajax to United, the Brazilian has already become a hero at Betis.",
      "Forest were celebrating a return to European football for the first time in nearly 30 years, but couldn't secure the first win of the Postecoglou era as the former Tottenham boss made it four games at his new club without victory. Forest striker Igor Jesus scored twice, yet it was Antony who had the last laugh.",
      "The Betis winger first found Cedric Bakambu, who opened the scoring with a powerful finish into the roof of the net. Jesus equalised with a tap-in before putting Forest 2-1 up with a header from a corner.",
      "But Antony popped up at the back post in the 85th minute to equalise before celebrating by pointing to a tattoo on his neck which reads “iluminado\" - a Portuguese word which translates as “illuminated” or “the chosen one”. Betis fans certainly won't be arguing with him after another crucial performance which means he has nearly passed his total of goals and assists for United in a fraction of the time with his new club.",
      "United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe cited Antony as the sort of missteps in the transfer market that he wants to eliminate now Ineos have taken over the club. \"If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we're buying Antony, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying [Jadon] Sancho,\" Ratcliffe told the BBC.",
      "\"These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things and have to sort that out. Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid. But for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time. We've got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future.\"",
      "United made a huge loss in selling Antony to Betis this summer and his performances in Spain won't please Ratcliffe if they continue. With United not playing in any European competition this season, having finished 15th in the Premier League last season and lost the Europa League final, the petrochemicals billionaire had to go elsewhere for his football fix on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe was spotted in the stands of his other club, Nice, but it wasn't happy viewing for him in the south of France either. Nice were beaten 2-1 by Roma in the Europa League thanks to goals from Evan Ndicka and Gianluca Mancini.",
      "United will be back in action this weekend against Brentford when Ratcliffe will hope they can build on their 2-1 win over Chelsea. He may secretly be hoping that Antony's form for Sevilla stalls, while Onana, Hojlund and Sancho will be trying to prove him wrong while on loan at Trabzonspor, Napoli and Aston Villa respectively.",

      "Manchester United and Barcelona are set to hold off on talks about a permanent deal for Marcus Rashford until the end of the season, according to reports. After falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim, Rashford switched to Spain on a season-long loan.",
      "The 27-year-old snubbed other potential moves to join Hansi Flick's side following a brief stint at Aston Villa. Since he arrived at the Nou Camp, Rashford has netted twice and provided two assists in six matches.",
      "Rashford's current loan deal includes an option for Barcelona to purchase him for a pre-agreed fee of £26.2million. Before this option is exercised, the striker's development on and off the pitch and the club's financial situation will be considered.",
      "Another factor to consider is Robert Lewandowski's future. The 37-year-old's contract in Spain is due to expire at the end of the season, and Rashford's ability to operate as a No.9 could play a pivotal role in determining the futures of both players.",
      "\"I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, every player my age has watched them play, it's amazing football.\"",
      "When questioned about the duration of his stay in Spain, he responded: \"As many [seasons] as possible. We will see.",

      "Bruno Fernandes' actions have left their mark on his Manchester United team-mates with goalkeeper Dermot Mee recalling how the captain gave him a signed shirt on their first meeting - despite him losing their bet.",
      "Mee came through the ranks at Walsall but the 22-year-old moved to Manchester in 2019. After continuing to impress in the youth ranks he was invited to train with the first-team once he was 18 and engaged in a competition with Fernandes.",
      "The young goalkeeper was tasked with saving two of five shots from the Portuguese playmaker with the prize being a signed shirt from the United captain. Mee failed, but Fernandes still produced a shirt regardless with his gesture leaving its mark on him.",
      "United put out a video on social media with players asked to recall their favourite Fernandes moment and the goalkeeper recalled: \"Probably say when I was about 18, first time I went up and trained with them, he gave me a bet - If I could save two out of five of his shots he'd give me a signed shirt. I didn't do it but he went and got me one anyway.",
      "In an effort to go and further his development Mee, who is yet to make an appearance for the Manchester outfit, has had loan spells in non-league with the likes of Witton Albion and Altrincham. The goalkeeper has previously travelled to San Diego for a training camp and pre-season friendly against Wrexham.",
      "Fernandes has long been regarded as the team's talisman and a host of his team-mates referenced other major moments during his United career. Several players talked up his free-kick against Arsenal last season, a game that finished 1-1.",
      "The 31-year-old also enjoyed a memorable moment at Old Trafford against Liverpool back in April 2024, which too was referenced by the likes of Kobbie Mainoo. Fernandes was quick to seize on a mis-placed pass by the Reds and hammered home a shot first time.",
      "His effort caught Caoimhin Kelleher out of position and levelled a contest that eventually finished 2-2. Other moments included a hat-trick scored by the playmaker against Real Sociedad last term in a 4-1 win in the Europa League.",
      "Fernandes remains the team's leading light and he's scored in both of their wins so far this season. He scored a stoppage time penalty to down Burnley at Old Trafford and was also on target at the weekend when United beat Chelsea.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been an underwhelming appointment at United and has been unable to shake off the pressure on his job. The Portuguese boss has won just 19 of his 48 matches in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November, finishing a lowly 15th in his debut season.",
      "Amorim retains the support of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos for the time being, but he is only another succession of poor results away from that stance changing. And Toppmoller has thrown his hat into the ring if the United hierarchy do end up looking for a replacement.",
      "“Basically it's a dream to be at Frankfurt. It's simply a fantastic club,” he said on the Phrasenmaeher podcast. “Here, as a teenager, I witnessed for the first time that my father was a Bundesliga coach. That naturally creates an emotional bond with the club.",
      "“Thinking about abroad, I often played computer games as a child, always with one team: Manchester United. That would definitely be nice some day because it's an extraordinary club. When I was a teenager, Manchester United were along with Real Madrid the biggest club of all.”",
      "The former RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich assistant manager has won 46 per cent of his matches since becoming Frankfurt boss in July 2023. He has helped develop stars like Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike, who have both moved to the Premier League in big-money transfers, while establishing Frankfurt in the Champions League.",
      "The 44-year-old is highly regarded in Germany and his side caught the eye by thrashing Galatasaray 5-1 in their first match of the Champions League group phase. They are currently sixth in the Bundesliga having won two and lost two of their opening four games.",
      "Amorim eased some of the pressure on him by beating Chelsea 2-1 in the league on Saturday and now faces key matches before the October international break. United travel to Brentford this weekend before playing Sunderland at Old Trafford the following week.",

      "The club's great goalscorer was poised to sign a new deal in 2010 but wanted clarity on the club's direction after he'd seen his fellow forwards Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez both sold by the Red Devils. United had just lost the league title to Chelsea and Rooney wanted to know who they were signing.",
      "Ferguson didn't take kindly to his authority being questioned and the pair clashed, leading to Rooney putting in a transfer request. The saga lasted just a matter of days before the Evertonian penned a new contract.",
      "But looking back Rooney claims his concerns were later realised. The Manchester outfit won the top flight in 2011 and 2013, but with an ageing squad that lacked the superstar talent of yesteryear and Rooney believes no answer has ever been offered as to what the club's plan was.",
      "He said on Rio Meets Wayne: \"I think that question I asked then, in 2010, it still hasn't been answered, been addressed, from 2010. And I think fans have seen... I don't think, if fans look back, they'd be like, you know what, he actually seen what was coming a little bit. And I don't think it's been fixed since 2010.\"",
      "United have failed to even challenge for the title since 2013 with David Moyes and Louis van Gaal coming in after Ferguson, but both men were left to transition an ageing squad. Huge sums were spent, but recruitment has been a major issue with Rooney holding on to the fact that his concerns in 2010 were legitimate.",
      "He added: \"Well, if I look back to 2010, I don't think it has. I don't think, we obviously won the league in 2013, but lots changed, obviously. Commercially, social media, everything changed. But I still think when we lost Ronaldo and Tevez, from that moment, we got Robin in, obviously, for a couple years.",
      "\"But from that moment the club has never had a group of forwards who... Look, before my time, with Teddy, with Solskjaer, Coley, Yorkie. Then you've got me, Ronaldo, Tevez, Berbatov, Saha. From that moment, the club has never had a group of forwards who can all play and come win you games. And that is Man United.\"",
      "Rooney admits with the benefit of hindsight maybe his decision to challenge Ferguson wasn't right, but ultimately claimed \"I still think I had a right to ask the question.\" The forward was unsure whether the club were entering a period of transition, which ultimately has proven to be the case.",

      "Tuchel's decision to look elsewhere has come with Mainoo becoming a frustrated figure at Old Trafford at his lack of action. He has struggled for regular starts under Amorim and his career has gone backwards in the last 12 months. And amid his frustrations, Mainoo remains keen - should things not improve at United - to seal a loan move in the next transfer window.",

      "Dalot, who was absent for United's last two matches against Manchester City and Chelsea, participated in training on Tuesday and will be part of the squad travelling to Brentford.",
      "Like many of his teammates, Dalot has had an inconsistent start to the season but shone in the dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley at Old Trafford before the international break.",
      "In the triumph over the Clarets, Dalot showcased his attacking prowess in the left wing-back position, setting up Bryan Mbeumo's first Old Trafford goal. Had it not been for an injury sustained while on international duty with Portugal, Dalot would likely have started against City and Chelsea, but Noussair Mazraoui took his place in both games.",
      "Despite questions surrounding Dalot's defensive discipline and reliability, United boss Amorim appreciates his work rate and energy, crucial attributes for his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "There are also concerns about Dalot's final ball when he finds himself in threatening positions in the final third, although his assist for Mbeumo – running onto a flick-on from Joshua Zirkzee and then cutting the ball back inside for the goal – served as a reminder of his attacking capabilities.",
      "Patrick Dorgu appears to have secured his position as the left wing-back, leaving Dalot, Mazraoui and Amad to vie for the right-wing back role. Despite being the most offensive of the trio, Amad has struggled to find form and consistency this season.",
      "In the match against Chelsea, Mazraoui and Dorgu took on the wing-back roles, while Amad was positioned as one of the two No.10s, supporting Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Given that Dalot hasn't played a competitive game in four weeks, it's likely that Amorim will stick with the same line-up that served him well against Enzo Maresca's side for the Brentford match, despite the victory margin being narrower than necessary.",
      "Looking ahead, it'll be interesting to see if Amorim settles on a regular defensive line-up, as he has done with midfield and attack. In midfield, his go-to pairing is Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, although Casemiro is suspended for Saturday's game following his red card against Chelsea.",
      "His preferred attacking trio consists of summer signings Matheus Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko.",
      "However, there's more uncertainty in defence. Amorin seemed to have settled on a central three of Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro, only to drop Yoro for the Chelsea game in favour of Harry Maguire, who put in an excellent performance on Saturday and would be unfortunate not to retain his place.",
      "Dalot, on the other hand, faces a tough battle to regain his spot in the starting line-up, a task that will become even more challenging if he's left out of Saturday's squad and United manage to clinch consecutive Premier League victories under Amorim for the first time.",

      "The disciplinary action from Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick came just days after Rashford's pivotal two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League - his first goals since his high-profile summer switch to the La Liga heavyweights from United. Fears had been sparked after issues plagued his development at Old Trafford which led to his role within the squad diminishing.",
      "Despite being relegated to the bench for Getafe's visit, Rashford entered the fray and set up Dani Olmo for a goal in their 3-0 triumph on Sunday. Rashford secured his move to a Champions League side during the summer transfer window after Aston Villa didn't exercise their buy option for the England international.",
      "Rashford was just two minutes late for the Barcelona pre-match team meeting but falls out of line with the German tactician's zero tolerance policy. Shearer has warned that such lapses in professionalism won't be overlooked at an establishment of Barcelona's stature.",
      "\"Rashford can't be unprofessional, it's not right,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"We know that if Rashford is ready and if his attitude is right then there's a player in there.",
      "\"He was sensational against Newcastle. The second finish in particular was amazing. But you can't be unprofessional.",
      "\"Why should everyone hang around just for you? Why should everyone else be on time but you be late? It's not right.",
      "\"I guess if he wants to stay there, particularly only being on-loan, you can't do that when you're at a top club like Barcelona because there'll always be someone to take your place.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if you're two minutes late or 20 minutes late. You're late and your teammates have to wait for you. Why should they all be on time and you not?\"",
      "Barcelona stars Raphinha and Jules Kounde have also punished for their lateness by Flick. Shearer's comments come after former Red Devils midfielder Paul Scholes accused the attacker of 'quitting' during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Scholes said: \"There’s no doubt the talent that kid has got, it’s ridiculous, he’s shown up in a big game, and that second goal was brilliant.",

      "It was always likely to be a busy summer at Manchester United following a campaign which resulted in the club's lowest ever finish of the Premier League era.",
      "And so it proved as the Red Devils spent over £200million on new recruits while moving on a number of stars who had been deemed surplus to requirements. United have gone on to endure a mixed start to the new season and some of the 10 first-team players that were moved on during the summer transfer window have had similar fates away from Old Trafford.",
      "It's been a slow start to life at Stamford Bridge for Garnacho, who joined Chelsea in a £40million deal. He was handed his first start on Tuesday night against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup but it wasn't exactly a game which will live long in the memory: he failed to attempt a single dribble during his 59 minutes on the pitch and made little impact with the overall team display falling below par. To rub salt in his wounds, he was jeered all night by Lincoln fans and left the field to a rendition of \"You're f***ing s***\".",
      "Garnacho obviously has no shortage of talent and his lack of action over pre-season means an early exit against Lincoln was probably always on the cards. But taking into account his showing against League One opposition and his two other cameo appearances for the Blues to date, Garnacho hasn't caught light yet.",
      "Perhaps the most high-profile departure from United this summer, Rashford got the move he wanted when Barcelona came calling to take him on loan for the season. And to be fair to the England star, he's been able to show some of the reasons why the Spanish giants were so keen to land him, with his magnificent match-winning double against Newcastle in the Champions League undoubtedly the highlight of Rashford's spell at the Nou Camp so far.",
      "Unfortunately for Rashford, things took a sour turn at the weekend when he was dropped for turning up late to a training session. But he came off the bench to notch another assist, so the positives have far outweighed the negatives.",
      "Like Rashford, Antony had a specific destination in mind heading into the summer and re-joined Real Betis after a productive loan spell. The Brazilian winger dazzled in Spain and looked far more like the player United thought they were signed when they splashed north of £85m on him back in the summer of 2021.",
      "In terms of the current campaign, Antony has started both La Liga games for Betis so far this term but is yet to register a goal contribution.",
      "Hojlund reportedly didn't want to leave Manchester United but he's started all three of the games he's played for Napoli since joining the Italian champions on loan. He marked his Serie A debut with a goal which should give him a major confidence boost after regularly going long periods without scoring in a United shirt.",
      "After losing his spot in the team, Onana was offered the chance to kickstart his career in Turkey after a difficult period at Old Trafford. He didn't enjoy a perfect debut but he did make a decent impression and went on to notch an assist in his second Turkish Super Lig appearance.",
      "The Cameroon star is still waiting for his first clean sheet, but two games in and the early signs are promising for a player who will be desperate to rediscover his top form.",
      "Sancho joined Aston Villa on loan shortly before the transfer deadline. He has yet to make an impression at his new club, though, featuring for just eight minutes in the Premier League as a substitute. He did play 74 minutes against Brentford in the Carabao Cup second round, with Villa going out on penalties after a goalless draw.",
      "Like Sancho, Lindelof ended up making the move to Villa Park this summer after his contract at United expired. He too has hardly featured, with his sole appearance in a Villa shirt coming in a seven minute cameo against Everton in the Premier League.",
      "Eriksen has only just linked up with another club, signing for Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg. He has made just one substitute appearance for the club - 30 minutes in their recent 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund - but was criticised by former Denmark international, Thomas Gravesen, for training with Swedish side Malmo before joining his new club.",
      "United have high hopes for Collyer and in West Bromwich Albion the young midfielder has joined a team who are likely to be in the running for the Championship play-offs. He has featured in all five of the Baggies' league games to date but is yet to start for Ryan Mason's side, who are seventh in the table.",
      "Amass has linked up with crisis club Sheffield Wednesday and started both of their league games since leaving Old Trafford, albeit in a more advanced role on the left-hand side. Like Collyer, it's hoped that a season playing regularly in the Championship will be benificial for the talented youngster's development.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paul Pogba has said that he needs to take a leaf out of former Liverpool star Takumi Minamino's book having been thoroughly impressed by the Japanese international since his move to AS Monaco. The Frenchman is still waiting to make his debut for the Ligue 1 side after enduring a challenging three-year spell.",
      "The midfielder is on a mission to revive his career in France, following a series of injuries, a terminated contract with Juventus and an 18-month doping ban since his departure from Manchester United. His final season at Old Trafford in 2021/22 was marred by injuries, with his last appearance for the Red Devils ending prematurely during their 4-0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "Pogba completed a free transfer back to Juventus at the end of the season, but his injury troubles persisted. He was later provisionally suspended from playing due to a failed drug test in September 2023.",
      "Juventus terminated Pogba's contract last November - despite him only making 12 appearances for the club - even though Pogba successfully appealed his four-year doping suspension after being found guilty of taking the banned substance DHEA.",
      "The ban was reduced to 18 months in October 2024, allowing him to start training and playing again from January 2025 and March 2025, respectively. Pogba had to wait until June to secure a new club, eventually signing a two-year contract with Monaco.",
      "\"Finally the nightmare is over. I can look forward to the day when I can follow my dreams again,\" Pogba said in a statement after his ban was reduced.",
      "\"I always stated that I never knowingly breached World Anti-Doping Agency regulations when I took a nutritional supplement prescribed to me by a doctor, which does not affect or enhance the performance of male athletes.",
      "\"I play with integrity and, although I must accept that this is a strict liability offence, I want to place on record my thanks to the Court of Arbitration for Sport's judges who heard my explanation.",
      "\"This has been a hugely distressing period in my life because everything I have worked so hard for has been put on hold.\"",
      "But he has yet to turn out for his team as he continues working toward match fitness and sharpness, having been absent from competitive action since September 2023, when he appeared from the substitutes' bench during Juventus' encounter with Empoli.",
      "Minamino is one player who has certainly left his mark on Pogba at the training ground since arriving at Monaco, with the France international confessing he must take a leaf out of the Japanese star's book.",
      "\"Takumi is always the first one to arrive at training and the last to leave,\" he told Sportiva. \"I've never seen a player so disciplined yet enjoying football so much at the same time.",
      "\"That's something I need to learn from him. When you watch him play, you can clearly see he's always thinking on the pitch.",
      "\"He's incredibly smart, and his movement shows just how deeply he understands the game.\"",
      "Minamino and Pogba never went head-to-head as rivals during their respective spells at Liverpool and Manchester United, with the Japanese left warming the bench on each of the three occasions the Reds locked horns with a Red Devils team featuring his current colleague.",
      "The attacker – who shone in patches for Liverpool – clocked up 55 appearances across two-and-a-half campaigns at Anfield, notching 14 goals and three assists as he helped Jurgen Klopp's squad claim the Premier League in 2020 and both the League Cup and FA Cup in 2022, with numerous supporters believing he was undervalued during his stint on Merseyside.",
      "Having transferred to Monaco in a preliminary £12.9million deal in June 2022, Minamino has since made 105 appearances for the Ligue 1 team, contributing 21 goals and 17 assists.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned he could have just months remaining as Manchester United boss, with Oliver Glasner being backed as his potential replacement. The Portuguese manager has faced mounting pressure in recent weeks following United's worst start to the season since 1992-93.",
      "Saturday's 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford in the Premier League provided some relief as his squad delivered a determined display. However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster reckons it's merely a question of when, not if, Amorim receives his P45 after claiming his side have failed to click this term.",
      "He's also endorsed Crystal Palace chief Glasner as his natural successor following the Eagles' excellent start to the campaign, despite losing several crucial stars during the summer transfer window.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper said: \"I think he [Amorim] has got a couple months left, probably. He'll go through a bad little run of two or three or four games in a row where he loses and eventually they'll go, 'Right, we've had enough now, it's obviously not working.'",
      "\"I just watch them, and I don't really see any kind of cohesion. Somebody who would be good for Man United is Glasner. He's only got nine months left on his contract at Palace. My only worry about it is that Man United are so sick and tired of playing three at the back.",
      "\"If they go and get Glasner and he goes, 'Right, I'm playing three at the back,' they'll go, 'Nah, come on mate. This isn't going to work.' For this guy to have lost five star players though and for Palace still look like they've got better. They're fifth in the league.\"",
      "Glasner featured amongst numerous candidates previously identified on a shortlist of potential replacements for Amorim should he be dismissed from his role. Betting companies also highlighted Andoni Iraola, Gareth Southgate, Marco Silva and Mauricio Pochettino amongst the other contenders.",
      "Amorim was recently linked with a return to Portugal to take charge of Benfica amidst the continuing speculation surrounding his future at United. Those rumours were quashed when former Red Devils manager Jose Mourinho accepted the role last Friday.",
      "The ex-Sporting CP boss was subsequently questioned about Mourinho's appointment during a post-match interview following United's victory over Chelsea.",
      "\"He's the best Portuguese manager, and that won't change,\" Amorim told Portuguese channel DAZN. \"He's always been a very special person in our football, but also in the world, and he opened all the doors for us.",
      "\"I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Jose Mourinho. I think it's going to be a lot of fun for you all in Portugal, and we're going to enjoy it.\"",
      "Addressing his own future, he added: \"It's what it is and we'll see what happens. But [I'm] focussed only on Manchester and that will be my only club.\"",

      "Alvaro Carreras continues to receive praise from Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso as the former Manchester United player's transfer market value soars. Carreras was a United player from 2020 until 2024 after joining their academy from Madrid's.",
      "The left-back never featured in a first-team match for the Red Devils and was sent on loan to Preston North End and Granada before a subsequent stint at Benfica rejuvenated his career. Following an impressive half-season in Portugal, Carreras joined them on a permanent deal in the summer of 2024 for €6m plus a potential €3m in add-ons (£7.8m).",
      "His maiden full campaign in Portugal turned out to be a success and Real decided to act swiftly and secured the full-back's services. Now returned to the Spanish capital, Carreras has been making his mark and Alonso cannot resist lauding the former United player.",
      "\"I was optimistic [about his signing],\" Alonso told the media on Monday. \"His personality and competitive nature have pleasantly surprised me.",
      "\"He makes very few mistakes, he is very focused, he has great mental quality, great tactical and technical quality too, he is very complete. The instant impact he has had is surprising; it is fantastic news.",
      "\"We also have Fran [Garcia] and Ferland [Mendy] for that position, but his performance is excellent.\" Carreras hasn't missed a single minute in La Liga for Los Blancos this season, and that form has resulted in his value skyrocketing.",
      "Transfermarkt values Carreras at £31million after being snapped up by Real for £38million in the summer. Meanwhile, United's ever-present full-back Diogo Dalot is only worth £26million in the current market.",
      "That is the same as Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee. As for Patrick Dorgu, signed by Ruben Amorim as the first choice for the left flank, he is currently valued at £22million, the same as Noussair Mazraoui. After Carreras' summer move to Madrid, United did manage to pocket an extra £7.5m due to their sell-on clause, but they might end up ruing his sale.",

      "\"Welcome to the home of the greatest football club in the world,\" said Alan Keegan.",
      "The voice of Old Trafford was on duty to introduce Manchester United's Under-21s on Wednesday night, and Stephen Torpey attended following the unveiling of his arrival from Brentford.",
      "United officially announced Torpey as the new head of the academy an hour before the game. Torpey previously worked with Jason Wilcox at Manchester City and the pair sat together in the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "Torpey has the credentials to work in the academy of the 'greatest football club in the world', having excelled during his time at City and Brentford, but he will do well to emulate Nick Cox, who will leave behind a wonderful legacy when he becomes Everton's technical director at the end of the week.",
      "Perhaps Torpey's first observation was that Ruben Amorim's formation is not used by Travis Binnion, which has been questioned by some fans who argue it makes sense to use 3-4-3 from top to bottom.",
      "Darren Fletcher has made a superb start to his time in charge of the U18s and also does not use Amorim's formation. The U21s and the U18s are top of their respective leagues.",
      "\"It's a collective approach to decide how the academy team is going to play, so it's not my choice,\" he said. \"There's conversations between myself, Jason Wilcox, the senior coaches within the academy in terms of Trav Binnion, Dave Hughes, Adam Lawrence and Colin Little.",
      "\"We talk about the type of football that our boys will need to experience to give them a well-rounded education, which is going to equip them for the game, not just to get them to the start line and for them to make a debut, but these boys will still be playing around 2045 and 2050.\"",
      "Could the youth teams change formation now Torpey has succeeded Cox? It's possible, but it would be a huge shock to change the youth team's systems during the campaign.",
      "The priority for Torpey will be attempting to ensure there is no disruption from Cox's departure. United's academy has arguably been the only area of the club that has functioned well in recent years.",
      "United's U21 manager Binnion has been a hugely important cog in the academy system over the last few years and he named an interesting team to face Bilbao, starting Chido Obi on the bench partly due to rotation and partly to see how he would handle being rested.",
      "The U21s secured a 2-1 victory over Liverpool last weekend and Binnion rotated accordingly, but United looked like what they were in the first half against Bilbao: a team without their best players on the pitch.",
      "It didn't take long for Bilbao to open the scoring through Asier Hierro. The young striker finished into the bottom right corner at the Stretford End with a brilliantly struck free-kick. The Spaniards went into the interval with a one-goal advantage, but they had created enough chances to be leading by three.",
      "It wasn't until Binnion made four changes on the hour mark that United were able to produce quality in the final third. Shea Lacey, Amir Ibragimov, Finley McAllister and Gabriele Biancheri were introduced for Jayce Fitzergald, Jim Thwaites, Victor Musa and Reece Munro, and the changes had the desired effect.",
      "Ibragimov came close to scoring within seconds of entering the pitch - and Biancheri picked up the ball down the right a few minutes later. The youngster skipped down the wing and created a tap-in for James Scanlon.",
      "Biancheri didn't stop there and scored in the last seconds of added time to seal a late comeback. The goal meant United made the perfect start to the Premier League International Cup's group stage.",
      "It remains to be seen how Torpey will impact the academy. But his presence at Old Trafford signalled the start of a new era and he would have liked what he saw.",

      "Amorim took over from Ten Hag in 2024 and was left with a squad packed with high-priced, underperforming stars. This has led to a disappointing first year for Amorim, who has managed just nine victories from his 32 Premier League games in charge.",
      "During the summer window, Amorim succeeded in offloading several big-name players, with Alejandro Garnacho and Antony departing permanently. Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Andre Onana and Jadon Sancho were also sent out on loan, all of whom are unlikely to continue their Old Trafford careers next year.",
      "According to The Sun, more players will be shown the door in 2026, to help free up funds for a significant midfield signing. United chose to invest heavily in attacking reinforcements this summer, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko joining for a combined fee of over £200m.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "This meant that other areas were not strengthened, particularly in central midfield. There were strong calls for a new central midfielder to be brought in to aid the implementation of Amorim's rigid 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United were strongly linked with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, but despite preliminary discussions, a deal was considered too costly. Brighton value the Cameroon international at £115m and he could be the headline signing of next summer's window.",
      "According to The Sun, United chiefs are prepared to authorise a series of high-profile departures in an effort to reduce the wage bill ahead of another spending spree in the transfer market. Casemiro, who is set to become a free agent at the end of this season, is expected to be at the forefront of these exits.",
      "Despite having a strong first season, the Brazilian has struggled to maintain that form under both Ten Hag and Amorim. He continues to be a regular starter under Amorim, but his limitations were exposed when he received a red card in the recent victory over Chelsea.",
      "Casemiro was signed by United from Real Madrid for £70m in 2022 and remains one of the club's top earners. While United have the option to extend his current contract for another year, it seems increasingly likely that he will leave on a free transfer.",
      "Sancho, who was signed for £73m in the same summer as Casemiro, has been an even bigger disappointment. He hasn't played a league match for United in over two years, spending much of that time on loan.",
      "He is trying to revive his career with Aston Villa and becomes a free agent next July. It's unlikely that United will activate the 12-month option in his contract.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is also likely to move on, being the only member of Amorim's 'bomb squad' who didn't secure a summer exit.",
      "The left-back, who was Ten Hag's first signing for a fee of £13m, has had a difficult time with injuries. Despite being on the brink of a move to Turkey in the recent transfer window, the deal fell through.",
      "Like Casemiro and Sancho, he will be free to leave next year. However, it seems increasingly likely that former captain Harry Maguire will remain at United.",
      "Maguire, who became the world's most expensive defender when he joined from Leicester in 2019, still retains the support of his current head coach. Earlier this year, United activated a contract extension to keep him for this season, and they now hope to secure him on a longer contract, albeit on reduced terms.",

      "\"Torpey has recently led the rebuilding of Brentford’s youth structure, including the relaunch of a full academy programme from Under-9s to Under-18s. Prior to his January 2024 arrival at the west London club, he had led academy coaching across all groups at Manchester City, and at the foundation phase, with Liverpool.",

      "In June, it was confirmed that Cox was to leave the academy after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton.

      "Hello and welcome to the live Manchester United blog for Thursday, 25 September.",
      "United are again back in Premier League action on Saturday as they make the journey down to London to take on Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium (12.30pm kick-off).",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will look to build momentum after last week's 2-1 win over Chelsea. That victory relieved some of the pressure on the United boss amid a lot of talk over his future following a disappointing start to the season.",
      "United will be without midfielder Casemiro for the game against the Bees. The midfielder was sent off against Chelsea after receiving two yellow cards in the first half. He will therefore now be suspended for one game.",
      "Away from the pitch, while the transfer window may now be closed, there is still a lot of talk about potential comings and goings ahead of the January window. United will be keen to strengthen their midfield with Carlos Baleba one name who has been heavily linked following an enquiry in the summer.",
      "There is also some talk over the future of England captain Harry Kane with United one of the clubs said to be showing an interest in the striker.",
      "Stay tuned for all of the latest live updates throughout the day...",
      "Antony has opened up on pre-season while in the United 'bomb squad'.",
      "The winger believes it affected his fitness, quotes via ABC.",
      "I'm a little tired because I didn't do pre-season, I didn't train in Manchester with the team. It was difficult for me. It's a bit difficult physically, but I feel better every day.",
      "Mouhamed Dabo is said to be very close to signing for United.",
      "Africafoot claims the teenager has spent several weeks training with the club's academy teams at Carrington. However, Barcelona has reportedly taken the midfielder on trial from Bsport Académie previously and continue to closely monitor the Senegal youth internationally.",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo believes Antony is the club's most significant signing ever.",
      "Manchester United reportedly have two possible alternatives to Carlos Baleba, if they are not able to reach an agreement with Brighton.",
      "United first showed their interest in the midfielder back in the summer transfer window but their approach was met with a clear answer from the Seagulls.",
      "The club didn’t want to sell the player, and would only consider offers of around the £115 million they earned from the sale of Moises Caicedo to Chelsea back in 2023. That caused United to walk away from any potential deal.",
      "Full story here",
      "Spanish football expert Guillem Balague has given the latest on Marcus Rashford and a potential permanent move to Barcelona.",
      "\"I think it's early to say, I'm I'm going from what I'm hearing from the club.",
      "\"Quite clearly, he adds something different and the idea is, having learned about the positional game when he was Aston Villa, he now goes to Barcelona where he is applying that.",
      "\"People say within the camp he needs to rebel against the situation. If he's not playing he needs to work harder or at least make them feel that he really wants it, but he's not that kind of person.",
      "\"What he is is that when he gets the opportunity he takes it with both hands, as he did with the two goals (against Newcastle).",
      "\"He came on at half time for Raphina which is a big thing, that shows that there's trust in him and he's got to keep going.",
      "\"January, February that will be perhaps the time to decide.\"",

      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank has said that Kane would be 'more than welcome' back at the club.",
      "Spurs are said to be one of the clubs providing competition to United if Kane moves on from Bayern Munich.",
      "Speaking this week, Frank said:",
      "\"There are a lot of Tottenham fans, including myself who would like to see Kane back,\" Frank said.",
      "\"Personally, I don't think he will do it right now, if I'm honest. He'll probably stay in Bayern [Munich] and continue performing well. He was the top scorer last year. He won the title and he's doing fantastic now.",
      "\"I don't know what he's thinking. Myself, I'm a traveller, I like to explore things as well, so he's been here for many years, so why not enjoy the time in Bayern a little bit more.",
      "\"But he's welcome. If he wants to join us, he's more than welcome.\"",

      "Former Manchester United winger Antony was on the scoresheet for the first time since making his move to Real Betis permanent this summer.",
      "The Spanish side were trailing 2-1 against Nottingham Forest in the Europa League tie, but with five minutes to play Antony scored what could be a crucial equaliser.",
      "The Brazilian enjoyed a successful loan spell with the club in the second half of last season, promoting them to make the deal permanent in the summer.",

      "It's understood Mainoo has even changed his private chef at home in an attempt to improve his game. The midfielder also worked with a private coach during the September international break.",
      "Mainoo is desperate to start regularly for United again after slipping down the pecking order.",
      "The 20-year-old wanted to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window, but United did not entertain his request. The MEN have been told Mainoo did not want to leave his boyhood club permanently, and only wanted a loan for the sake of regular minutes in an important season.",
      "The youngster has reacted positively to the denial of his loan request and is focused on forcing his way into United's starting team so that he can represent England at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Mainoo started against Spain in the Euro 2024 final, but he was not included in England's squad for September's international fixtures. Thomas Tuchel explained that he needs minutes to feature in his plans.",
      "Representing England next summer is a huge motivation for Mainoo.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to fight for his place and he provided detailed thoughts on the youngster when he spoke at a press conference ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "\"No, like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,\" said Amorim when asked whether he'd seen a difference in Mainoo. \"I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed - I did this week.",
      "\"Because I don't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having any conversation with him just to hold on to him. I don't want that feeling. I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League so far this term. Amorim said: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",

      "\"And I know that he can give that. So sometimes, like you said, maybe if I start more Kobbie Mainoo, then he is going to play and he's going to get hard to take out. Sometimes it's not fair, but I need to go with what I'm feeling in the moment, and that is the only feeling.",
      "\"I know that he started the final of the European Championship in one team that has a lot of talented players. (Phil) Foden played in that game. (Cole) Palmer was on the bench. He (Mainoo) was playing… I know all that. But sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.\"",

      "Aston Villa are already planning on making Manchester United loanee Jadon Sancho a permanent signing, according to reports.",
      "The 25-year-old winger has not been with the club a month but has clearly left a positive impression on Unai Emery and Co during his short stay following the move from Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho has played 82 minutes across two matches for Villa after completing his switch and will hope to soon have a bigger role, having spent pre-season training separately from United's first team squad.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star joined Villa late in the transfer window after a summer of uncertainty, following Chelsea's decision to pay a £5million penalty fee rather than make his loan permanent at the end of last season.",
      "United would have preferred to see Sancho exit the club permanently but, despite interest from Italy, they were unable to find an option that suited both club and player.",
      "That will have proven frustrating for United, with Sancho now in the final year of his contract at Old Trafford. The club hold an option to extend his deal by a further year, but it is almost certain not to be triggered as they attempt to offload his salary.",
      "It appears Villa are plotting to take advantage of that situation, with manager Emery being happy with what he's seen so far from Sancho, according to National World. The Midlands side also secured a free transfer from United this summer with Victor Lindelof arriving at Villa Park after his contract expired.",
      "From the outset of Sancho's move to Villa, Emery has had high expectations. The Spanish coach envisions a possible England call-up for Sancho under Thomas Tuchel - the attacker has earned just one cap since signing for United in 2021.",
      "\"Yes, of course, this is my objective, to get him back to his best - and if he does that then he’ll come back to the national team,\" Emery said earlier this month.",

      "Manchester United are amongst the clubs reportedly monitoring him as they seek to fix their weaknesses in that midfield department. Anderson's performances grabbed Thomas Tuchel's notice and the Forest player recently earned his first Three Lions cap. That followed a summer where he helped the U21s retain their crown at the Euros.",
      "Cole is now tipping the 22 year old to feature for England at the World Cup next summer, highlighting attributes in his play that make him indispensable, and believes his meteoric rise will probably result in him departing Forest.",
      "\"I've watched him many times, I see something in him, he's a winner. There was a moment at the U21 Euros when he was dropped for a game and then he come on and scored the penalty and there was an anger in his face. There's a belief in him, the way he goes into tackles.",
      "\"And I think as a player I'd want Anderson in my team next to me, and I think Tuchel sees that, I think he's put himself in pole position. If he keeps playing like he is tonight, if he keeps on at his trajectory, the sky is the limit for the kid.\"",
      "Anderson's knack for controlling the tempo in the middle of the park is set to make him extremely coveted in the transfer market. The midfielder switched from Newcastle to Nottingham for £35million, though his present club could demand twice that figure should he seek pastures new.",
      "Tuchel faces the challenge of delivering World Cup glory for England, and the German boss has praised Anderson's qualities following his recent Three Lions bow.",
      "\"He's just a very, very good football player,\" he said. \"He has the physicality, he's very mobile at No 6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to duels. He loves passing, he loves to break the lines, he's very mobile in this game. It was a pleasure to see.\"",

      "The former striker spent 13 years with United between 2004 and 2017. During that time, he played 559 games, scoring 253 goals for the club.",
      "Rooney hung up his boots in 2021. Despite him only being retired for a relatively short time, he is convinced that he would now struggle to cope in a modern day dressing room, like the one now at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Speaking to former United teammate Rio Ferdinand on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the former England captain gave a simple response when asked if he, or former midfielder Roy Keane, would cope in the current United dressing room.",
      "“No,” he said. “We’d get sacked.” He then added: “Some of the stuff which got said in the dressing room. That's where now, and it is society as well, you can't say this because you might upset this person.",
      "“You’re a bully, and you get accused of bullying and stuff.” He went on to give his thoughts about the culture shift in dressing rooms.",
      "“What happened to speaking the truth and saying, like, 'What are you doing?' Having a go, because when you used to have a go at me, [I'm thinking] 'I'm not letting him do that again'. Or I'd have a go at you,” he said.",
      "“It wakes you up. It brings you alive. And it's a responsibility. I have a responsibility to keep you, to keep him, to keep him on their toes. And you have a responsibility.",

      "Rooney tried his hand at management, first with Derby County, before unsuccessful spells with Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle. He has since concentrated on the punditry side of the game.",
      "“I've walked out of dressing rooms as a manager because I'll explode,” he added on his time as a manager. “I've seen a player call another player out, not in a bad way, and it is what it is, it's nothing.",
      "“And then I've seen another player saying, 'You can't do that. If you want to speak to him, do it one-on-one. This is bullying'.",
      "“And I'm stood there, waiting. I always let the players talk and I encourage them to talk to each other at half-time, at full-time. And then I'll come in and say something.",
      "“And I heard that and I just looked. I was like, what am I going to say? 'Just get a shower'. Walked out, didn't say a word to them. And it's mad, isn’t it? It's society.",
      "“You don't know what you can and can't say as well. Got to be really careful in what you try and say, how you want to say it, how you project it, what tone of your voice you're saying it in.",
      "“And so, it's so many different things, but ultimately, you want to try and get the best from that person.”",

      "The competition features 16 English academy teams and 16 of the top development squads from European nations.",

      "Recap what happened at Old Trafford here.",
      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",
      "Biancheri has won it at the death for United!",
      "The game is becoming a tad stretched, with both sides not wanting to settle for a point.",
      "The youngsters suddenly have the momentum and look capable of winning this match.",
      "Biancheri with a tremendous run down the right and Scanlon finishes.",
      "That was the first moment of quality from United - Biancheri made an immediate impact",
      "Lacey, Ibragimov, McAllister and Biancheri ON.",
      "Fitzergald, Thwaites, Musa and Munro OFF.",
      "United haven't been great and could do with the introduction of Obi, Lacey and Ibragimov.",
      "Bilbao really should be 2-0 ahead but they've just fired wide of the post when Murdock went the wrong way.",
      "Bilbao are searching for another goal and it feels like only a matter of time before we see changes.",
      "We're back under way for the second half - let's hope United find a way back into this.",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Almost half-time here at Old Trafford.",
      "You'd like to think Obi is introduced for the second half of this game, but there probably needs to be a change in midfield as well.",
      "United haven't offered much going forward and are stuggling to produce quality.",
      "Obi, Ibragimov and Armer are already warming up, which suggests we could have changes at half-time.",
      "Great save from Murdock to deny the visitors a second goal.",
      "Feels like United are slightly under the cosh here.",

      "United's statement said: \"Stephen Torpey has started work as Manchester United’s new academy director.",
      "\"Joining from Brentford, Stephen’s appointment as successor to Nick Cox was announced in August. Cox has joined Everton, where he’ll serve as technical director.",
      "\"Torpey has recently led the rebuilding of Brentford’s youth structure, including the relaunch of a full academy programme from Under-9s to Under-18s. Prior to his January 2024 arrival at the west London club, he had led academy coaching across all groups at Manchester City, and at the foundation phase, with Liverpool.\"",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Obi has been named on the bench tonight, which is a surprise. The youngster is the star man for the U21s, but he will have to be patient to make an impact against Athletic Bilbao. The youngster made eight first-team appearances last term, he outshone Rasmus Hojlund during the post-season trip and travelled to the United States for pre-season. However, Obi has not been named in a senior squad this term.",

      "Binnion is expected to name a strong side to take on Bilbao.",
      "Covering United academy fixtures can be fun. Team sheets are like gold dust at Leigh Sports Village and the security guy at Old Trafford is saying that entry to the media room isn’t permitted until 6pm. I’ve been working on the forecourt benches and praying it doesn’t hammer it down."

      "The time has come for Ruben Amorim to put his faith in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are five games into the new Premier League season and Mainoo has yet to start any of them, the midfielder having played just 76 minutes coming off the bench.",
      "An unused substitute in the first two league games, Mainoo's only start was in United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Even when Amorim deviated from his preferred central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for the 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, dropping the former, Mainoo was overlooked, with Manuel Ugarte getting the nod ahead of him.",
      "The irony of that decision is that when Mainoo eventually did come on at the Etihad Stadium, just after the hour mark, he brought more energy and mobility to United's midfield, underlining the folly of Amorim's decision to start the hapless Ugarte over him.",
      "Now, with Casemiro suspended for Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford following his sending off in Saturday's chaotic 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford, Amorim has a major selection dilemma in midfield - whether to start Mainoo or Ugarte.",
      "Given Amorim has insisted he will continue to deploy skipper Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, despite it not playing to his attacking strengths, it seems a straight choice between Mainoo and Ugarte as to who partners him in the middle.",
      "Given Mainoo is not a holding midfielder and defensive duties are not second nature to him, it seems inevitable that Amorim will go with Ugarte for the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium, to give United greater security and a ball-winning mentality in the middle.",
      "Another option would be to play both Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield, but given Amorim's reluctance to play Fernandes further forward and therefore displace one of his first-choice front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – all big-money summer signings – that scenario seems unlikely.",
      "Mainoo's desire to go out on loan before transfer deadline day, because of a lack of playing time, was entirely understandable, even if it gave the impression of a player with a questionable mentality, unwilling to prove himself and meet the challenge to fight for his place.",
      "At 19, Mainoo started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain but was not even included in Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad because of his outcast status at United. In a World Cup year, Mainoo's fear that he will miss out on next summer's tournament in the US is entirely justified, if Amorim continues to overlook him.",
      "The Brentford game, therefore, is the perfect platform for Amorim to show he means it when he says he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, even though he has pointed out the young prodigy still has to improve in many areas, not least in his defensive mindset, tracking back and positional discipline.",
      "But on Saturday, with Casemiro unavailable and Mainoo relishing the chance to start a first league game of the season, Amorim has the opportunity to change the dynamic of United's team. Given Amorim's pragmatism and unwillingness to change from his formation and personnel, Mainoo is primed for more disappointment, but starting him may be the bold step that can finally kickstart United's season.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire has leapt to the defence of Luke Shaw after he came underfire from Roy Keane following the defeat to Manchester City earlier this month. United were underwhelming in the Manchester derby, losing 3-0 to their fierce rivals. And, unsurprisingly after such a heavy loss, the critics were out in force to pick apart the Reds' failings.",
      "One man who caught particular criticism from Keane was Shaw. The former United captain insisted the full-back, who is currently being utilised in a three-man defence, 'gave up' allowing Phil Foden to score. Addressing those criticisms after defeating Chelsea a week later, Shaw admitted: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin.",
      "\"He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player.",
      "\"I listen to it, but I think he was right. Last week, I wasn’t at my level at all and I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me.",
      "\"After the game, I knew that. But of course it hurts.\"",
      "Maguire is obviously no stranger to being criticised while playing for United. When he was captain, the Englishman was often mocked online, taking the criticism of him to a whole new level.",
      "In an interview with United's official club website after surpassing 250 appearances for the club, Maguire defended Shaw.",
      "\"You don’t play at this club 250 or 300 times if you’re first and foremost not a good player,\" the centre-back explained.",
      "\"Luke’s an excellent footballer, and every manager that comes in, he gets questioned a lot. That’s what happens at this club.",
      "\"Every manager that comes in plays Luke, and there’s a reason why they play Luke, because he’s an excellent footballer, always has been and always will be.\"",

      "Former Manchester United defender Alvaro Carreras has been earning plaudits from his new Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso as his value continues to sky rocket.",
      "Carreras was on the books at Old Trafford from 2020 until 2024 after being picked up by United's academy from Real Madrid. However, the Spaniard was not given much of a chance to impress in the first-team.",
      "The left-back never made a senior appearance for the Reds and was loaned to Preston North End and Granada before an eventual spell at Benfica revitalised his career. After enjoying half a season in Portugal, Carreras signed permanently with them in the summer of 2024.",
      "His only full season in Portugal proved to be a hit and Real chose to strike while the iron was hot and snapped the full-back up. Now back in the Spanish capital, Carreras has been impressing and Alonso cannot help but praise the former United man.",
      "\"I was optimistic [about his signing],\" Alonso told the media on Monday. \"His personality and competitive nature have pleasantly surprised me.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He makes very few mistakes, he is very focused, he has great mental quality, great tactical and technical quality too, he is very complete. The instant impact he has had is surprising, it is fantastic news.",
      "\"We also have Fran [Garcia] and Ferland [Mendy] for that position, but his performance is excellent.\" Carreras has not missed a minute in La Liga for Los Blancos this season and that form has led to his value sky-rocketing.",
      "According to transfermarkt, Carreras has a market value of £30.5m after being snapped up for £43m in the summer by Real. United full-back Diogo Dalot meanwhile, who has been an ever-present at Old Trafford and has been utilised at both right and left wing-back prior to his injury, is only worth £26m in the current market.",
      "As for Patrick Dorgu, who was signed by Ruben Amorim to be the first choice on the left flank, he has a current market value of £21.8m. After Carreras signed for Real in the summer, United did manage to bank an extra £7.5m thanks to their sell-on clause but they may well come to regret selling him.",

      "For the first time this season, they will debut their black third kit. So far, they have worn the red home shirt in all six competitive fixtures and only played in the white away kit during pre-season.",
      "The strip's black base includes yellow and blue details, nodding to the away kit worn between 1993 and 1995. However, at Brentford, United will wear a unique kit to comply with the rules on kit clashing.",
      "Ordinarily, the kit would contain black shirts and shorts to match the shirt. However, the Reds will wear yellow socks for this game due to Brentford's black shorts and socks.",
      "It's a similar move to what Arsenal had to do when they travelled to Athletic Club in the Champions League last week. The Gunners' away kit contains dark blue and back with the shorts and socks the same colour, but they were forced to wear white socks and shorts due to them clashing with Athletic's home strip.",

It has been claimed that the former Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund man contacted Rashford to discuss moving to Villa.",
      "Rashford is thought to have given the West Midlands club a glowing recommendation and the deal was completed at the start of this month.

If you ask a fan, they want to be back to winning the league every year for the next 20 years like they did... this time of football it is almost impossible, to do that with so many other clubs having that many good players around. It's tough.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘closed a deal’ ahead of the winter transfer window, while Kobbie Mainoo is ‘ready to leave’.",
      "It has been a hectic couple of months at Man Utd, who have overseen a major squad overhaul under head coach Ruben Amorim and INEOS.",

      "Despite this, Mainoo had this request denied as Man Utd felt his exit would have left them short of midfield options amd he has been more involved in recent weeks.",

      "‘Amid his frustrations, Mainoo remains keen – should things not improve at United – to seal a loan move in the next transfer window.

      "Paul Scholes won’t claim to speak for anyone. In the past, he barely spoke for himself and some, including Matt Stead, might recall the former midfielder’s mute period with some fondness. But while Scholes’ latest outburst has not been well received in some quarters, he succinctly summed up the feelings of many Manchester United fans towards another of their former heroes.",
      "Scholes labelled Marcus Rashford a ‘disgrace’ for his conduct, demeanour and perceived levels of effort towards the end of his Old Trafford career. Strong words from Scholes at a time he just so happens to be launching a new podcast.",
      "Maybe it is a cynical soundbite carefully crafted by Scholes to amplify the platform more than the message. However thick he might be laying it on, there will be plenty who watched Rashford ‘walking…not trying’ that broadly agree with his sentiment.",
      "Rashford really ought to have been carried out of Old Trafford shoulder high, if he had to leave at all. The academy graduate was a hometown hero turned national treasure for feeding hungry kids and bothering Tories. For the relationship between Rashford and his boyhood club to turn so sour, there are many with questions to answer.",
      "Steady rightly points the finger at United, a ‘broken club’ with a ‘corroded culture’. He’s right. Rashford’s United is a sh*tshow compared to Scholes’s.",
      "But at some point, individuals have to be held accountable rather than just attributing failure to some mysterious, ruinous post-Fergie curse. Rightly, flak is flung at the boardroom and axes swung at managers. The players? They cop it too, mostly for the crime of not being fit to lace the boots of Scholes, Butt, Keane, Beckham, Neville. Many of today’s squad, promoted above their levels and high above their ceiling, are being damned by comparison.",
      "But what about the ones who do have the talent to follow in those illustrious footsteps? And those who were reared to view The United Way as a concept vastly different to what it currently represents?",
      "Rashford is one of a few who ticked both boxes. It would have pained him to see what the club was becoming but, unlike the fans, he was in a position to lead a change. The extra adoration reserved for academy graduates also comes with the responsibility of maintaining the standards set by those that came before.",
      "Instead, as Scholes put it, Rashford ‘quit on United’. Whether he was exasperated or not, the evidence offers no other conclusion.",
      "Over 18 months, Rashford’s actions and demeanour spoke of a player who steadily gave up on his club. Repeated disciplinary breaches, the barely-arsed body language… the writing was on the wall long before Henry Winter posted it on X.",
      "When Ruben Amorim arrived last November, Rashford was certainly not alone in giving the impression that just going through the motions was too much to ask.",
      "The rotten standards prompted anger from supporters towards many players, most notably Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho. But those faces are quickly forgotten. The disappointment and regret over Rashford inevitably lingers.",
      "No doubt he was held to a higher standard. Hardly unfair when you consider Rashford’s pedigree and his status as one of the club’s highest earners. But in the end, the bare minimum was too much bother, an attitude that prompted some sympathy, some acrimony, but now mostly apathy towards the one-time local hero.",
      "“I really struggle to feel happy for him,” said Scholes, a stance that angered Steady and a few more besides. Including The i’s Pete Hall, who writes that Scholes’ criticism and previous narratives around Rashford amount to ‘bullying’. Knowing Pete, once of these parts, that’s a genuine belief. And given his leaning towards United, it highlights that no view on Rashford is unanimous.",
      "The witch-hunt in the right-wing media which attempted to smear Rashford amid the activism that prompted so much pride among United fans – that was bullying. Calling out his woefully-slipping standards as a footballer, one awarded one of the highest contracts in the history of his club, is not.",
      "So there are plenty of Stretford Enders who would echo Scholes’s sentiment. And that’s a reasonable reaction – human, even – in the circumstances. Only the most bitter would take satisfaction should Rashford flop at Barcelona, but neither should United fans be made to feel as though they ought to be cheering him on at the Nou Camp after he chose the path of disinterest out of Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford’s thunderb*stard at Newcastle in the Champions League last week will have caused many eyes in Manchester to roll. For United fans know better than anyone how Rashford is capable of such moments of brilliance having witnessed plenty for themselves. But those eyes will have rolled all the way back when news emerged of what followed next.",
      "With a brace at St James’ Park to build upon following an otherwise inauspicious start at Barca, Rashford turned up late for duty the following matchday. By two minutes, apparently.",
      "The level of his tardiness does not matter, especially when it is part of a pattern of behaviour. When you have unquestionably fallen upwards to a club as prestigious as Barca, where judgements are still being drawn by a new, hard-to-please manager, team-mates and fans, it is damning that it did not occur to him to be in at 9am, rather than skirting close enough to the 9.30am deadline to miss it.",
      "Damning but no longer surprising. Which goes a long way to explaining why Scholes and many others are returning the indifference that dripped off Rashford as he sloped towards the United exit.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Nottingham Forest are absolutely rattling through all the giddy highs and infuriating lows that come with Ange Postecoglou. It is captivating to watch.",
      "Newcastle United beat Bradford City 4-1 and that really does prove a ‘masterstroke’ from Eddie Howe.",
      "Eberechi Eze could be the genius Arsenal need but will he be allowed? He would probably get the chance at Liverpool.",
      "Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko are most at risk of being cast in one of the early season’s most embarrassing and undesirable modern roles.",
      "Liverpool’s performances this season have only been good enough for eighth place in the Premier League."

      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",
      "So basically, it’s running the game through algorithms and working out the average of how many points should have been garnered from each match according to the xG created and the xG conceded.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are ‘notably unhappy’ with the ‘frustration’ over Ruben Amorim’s contentious system and philosophy at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out but there are still widespread concerns over his 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford, and ahead of that win it was claimed he was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’, with ‘senior players’ questioning his tactics.",
      "Ratcliffe was at Carrington to meet with Amorim ahead of Sunday’s game, with Amorim joking that he was there to offer him a new deal.",
      "“New contract, he was offering me a new contract,” Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe’s visit.",
      "“No, it’s normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it’s a long project. He said many times, ‘This is my third season.’ For me, it’s not. But normal things.",
      "“I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.”",
      "And TBR Football’s chief correspondent Graeme Bailey has revealed more details on that meeting between Ratcliffe and Amorim, claiming United chief is “happy” with the summer transfer window and recognises an improvement in the team.",
      "Bailey said: “They’re happy with what’s happened over the summer – the players brought in, the system he’s implementing — and the main focus is seeing progress on the field.",
      "“And we are already seeing it: they’re a much better team than when he first took over, though admittedly they couldn’t have been much worse.",
      "“The club is backing Amorim. Jason Wilcox has fully bought into his approach, and the squad is being shaped in Amorim’s image. There’s little point in cancelling the experiment now — that would set the club back even further.”",
      "But the report adds that ‘Ratcliffe and his lieutenants are notably unhappy with the number of leaks around players voicing their frustration with Amorim’s system’.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave an update on Wednesday, from what he’s heard, on Amorim’s future at Man Utd.",
      "He said: “There is certainly appreciation for names like Oliver Glasner, but the sign that Amorim is still being backed is that there has been no outreach yet. There’s been no shortlisting yet. There hasn’t even, to my knowledge, been any succession planning yet.",
      "“Manchester United still want to try and make it work with Ruben Amorim. That’s why he is likely to get a few more games, at least, before some of these other names perhaps come a bit more seriously to the fore if results don’t go according to plan for Amorim.”",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller has thrown his hat into the ring for any future Man Utd job openings amid pressure on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ruben Amorim “has got a couple of months left” at Man Utd, according to Ben Foster, but one of his likely replacements has a big “worry” hanging over him.",
      "Teddy Sheringham reckons United should do away with Ruben Amorim and bring in Gareth Southgate who could fix the place up a bit.",
      "Man Utd have finalised a three-man shortlist to replace Ruben Amorim if the Red Devils decide to sack the Portuguese coach, according to reports.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",
      "Amorim *could* do some coaching like Slot has done to transform a Liverpool star into ‘the best in the world’. The Man Utd boss has an opportunity vs Brentford."

      "Manchester United are apparently now ‘leading the race for a No.6’ that they should have entered in the summer transfer window and almost certainly won’t win at the end of this season.",
      "The Red Devils opted to spend their cash this summer on an all-new forward line and a backup goalkeeper, with a late push for Carlos Baleba more of a nudge before a weird reported baulk at a £100m price tag slapped on a midfielder who was always going to be valued at that mark by Brighton.",
      "The United performances this season, featuring an inept Manuel Ugarte and a foolhardy Casemiro over wantaway Kobbie Mainoo in the double pivot with Bruno Fernandes have confirmed a need that seemingly everyone but the Manchester United decision-makers viewed as either priority one, two or three over the summer.",
      "‘Manchester United are ready to lead the way next summer in the race for No 6 midfielders with the key position expected to dominate the transfer market,’ The Telegraph claimed on Wednesday, before revealing later in the report precisely why the Red Devils won’t be leading that race.",
      "The lure of Big Club history may have been enough to persuade Bryan Mbeumo to snub Newcastle for Manchester United, but that will surely prove to be no match against modern-day behemoth Manchester City in the transfer stakes next summer.",
      "It’s claimed ‘Manchester City could look at that position to ease the workload of 2024 Ballon d’Or winner Rodri’ in a possibility we can’t imagine Nico Gonzalez will be too fond of as he works to prove himself as a serviceable backup to his Spanish compatriot.",
      "While reports suggest United will reopen talks with Brighton over Baleba, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are also on the Red Devils’ shortlist, but in an increasingly unimaginative transfer market in which top clubs chase the same players, placing particular value on homegrown talents like Anderson or Wharton, we can also assume they’re on City’s.",
      "And we wonder whether Liverpool’s likely push for Wharton as a backup for Ryan Gravenberch, having been linked with the Palace midfielder in the summer amid their apparent bid to provide Arne Slot with two brilliant footballers to choose between in every position, may in fact bring about a situation where United have to settle for current top target Baleba.",
      "As Fabian Hurzeler said at the weekend, Baleba is “not a machine” and there is a “responsibility” for Brighton to help him rediscover his form having had his head turned by United to such a degree that he doesn’t look worth the £23.5m the Seagulls paid for him in the summer of 2023, let alone the nine-figure sum they’re now asking for.",
      "A similar trajectory which saw Evan Ferguson fade into anonymity having been linked with a big-money move to United would presumably lead even the hive-minders at Old Trafford to plump for one of the two alternatives, but interest from City and Liverpool in those same players would surely result in United finishing last in a race they’re currently leading.",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "A new report claims Manchester United could sign an ‘elite’ player for *only* £60m in January, though this is utter nonsense…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’."

      "And the United legend believes that’s was a point the club has never truly recovered from, despite them winning the Premier League title in 2012/2013.",
      "Rooney told Ferdinand: “I think that question I asked then, in 2010, it still hasn’t been answered, been addressed, from 2010. And I think fans have seen… I don’t think, if fans look back, they’d be like, you know what, he actually seen what was coming a little bit. And I don’t think it’s been fixed since 2010.",

      "“We obviously won the league in 2013, but lots changed, obviously. Commercially, social media, everything changed. But I still think when we lost Ronaldo and Tevez, from that moment, we got Robin in, obviously, for a couple years, but from that moment the club has never had a group of forwards like that.",
      "“Look, before my time, with Teddy, with Solskjaer, Coley, Yorkie. Then you’ve got me, Ronaldo, Tevez, Berbatov, Saha. From that moment, the club has never had a group of forwards who can all play and come win you games. And that is Man United.",
      "“But this group of four players, they’re going to come win you the game. And think back to 2010. They haven’t had a group of forwards where, like, if I’m playing, I’m not playing well, and you’ve got Berbatov on the bench, or Tevez at times on the bench, Saha— you’re like, “I need to play well now.”",
      "“Now, There’s Højlund, Zirkzee, that’s it. Like, I feel for them, because in my opinion, they should be coming into games and winning games later on and having an impact off the bench. But they’re getting asked to play all the minutes and try and win games for the team, and there’s no back-up to it.",
      "“And there’s no— sometimes when you’re going through a bad period, sometimes it’s actually alright for the manager to take you out and say, just stay away. You’re not going to play— you might be on the bench— but just to take that pressure off you. And if you’re not scoring. So it’s… I honestly don’t think it’s been addressed, since then.”",

      "I understand why F365 thinks that Scholes has a Marcus Rashford problem.",
      "Because if you haven’t put yourself through each and every rubbish match they have played over the last 4-5 years, and then check that Rashford does play a few games a season quite well, you will wonder why Rashford is being targeted. But as someone who really really liked Marcus Rashford, and has put himself through each and every minute of each and every game since 10-15 years now, let me tell you why Scholes is just saying what every fan feels.",
      "Marcus is a local lad, who burst through and gave United fans hope that this is the next Academy player to be a star. He had great talent, was an amazing human and had the right values. So when he walks around the field for 80% of the match, literally not putting 2 steps to the right to try and defend or even fake defend when United don’t have the ball, and is one of the laziest players I’ve seen to grace the pitch, right up there with Martial and the 40 year old Ronaldo playing for Portugal currently. And while the Ronaldo case is easier to understand and the rest of the team work 10% harder to accommodate him at the age of 40, there is absolutely no reason the rest of the United team should suffer because Marcus cannot be bothered to do a proper job.",
      "On the edge of his own box, with the ball in front of him, he will just walk around and let the opposition players take shots or walk past him with ease. In EACH AND EVERY MATCH. It’s extremely annoying to watch regularly.",
      "Twice or thrice a season, he will put in a performance where he is energetic, runs with and without the ball, and his decision making is on point. But the rest of the time, he is one of the most lazy, infuriating and abysmal players on the pitch. Then comes his off-pitch behavior of being late, going partying, not working with the team agenda in mind, when he was the poster boy for Manchester United, it all mixes together to bring a feeling of sadness and regret at what he could have been and what he has become. The massive wages United gave him play a part in this downfall and for that I blame the management and board.",
      "The only reason I am excited for Rashford scoring or playing well for Barca is so United can scam 30 million pounds off for him, which no one in their right minds would otherwise pay along with his stupid wages. May he excel at Barca and find his peace there. I genuinely wish him well, and unlike Scholes I am happy for him if he finds a home in the beautiful city of Barcelona.\nAman",

      "To take Arteta and Arsenal as an example – I’m an Arsenal fan and don’t believe the culture is perfect at Arsenal. However I believe we can agree that Arteta has improved it since he arrived.",
      "Which demonstrates that the manager sets the required culture (standards), the players have to fall in line and if they don’t the manager needs to be backed by senior leaders to enforce the required standards. This starts with disciplining the players and if they continue to misbehave they need to be removed from the team and the club. This has what has clearly happened at Arsenal.",
      "At Utd both Ten Hag and Amorim have set standards. They started by disciplining players (dropping them/fining them) then moved to excluding them and then selling them. This was clearly backed by senior leadership who allowed multi million pound assets to lose value by excluding them from the first team.",
      "Therefore the managers and senior leadership have done their jobs in maintaining culture and standards.",
      "In conclusion what is left are the players that did not uphold Utd’s standards and culture. And although it could be argued that what they are paid is irrelevant, my argument would be that a) employees earning 25k a year are expected to adhere to company standards b) chief executives earning 10m a year are expected to adhere to company standards. Therefore people earning 15m a year certainly should be.",

      "There was literally zero prospect of a team trying to go through an entire season with just one recognised striker, so two were always going to be necessary. The fact that one of these unexpectedly turned out to be Isak may have pushed Ekitike from an expected starting role to backup, but doesn’t change the fundamental fact that he was always going to be competing with someone for his place. He was likely made aware of this when he signed.",
      "After a great start to his Liverpool career, getting himself sent off in some of the dumbest circumstances possible will have undoubtedly not helped him retain his starting position over Isak, but that has probably only accelerated the inevitable.",
      "However, with the number of games that Liverpool are likely to play and Isak’s lack of pre-season and slightly patchy injury record, Ekitike will still get plenty of starts and substitute appearances. It therefore seems unlikely that the times he spends on the bench will result in significant surprise or unhappiness on his part despite what the media and certain people BTL would have you believe.\nMatt D, London",

      "“If they go and get Glasner and he goes, ‘Right, I’m playing three at the back,’ they’ll go, ‘Nah, come on mate. This isn’t going to work.’ For this guy to have lost five star players though and for Palace still look like they’ve got better. They’re fifth in the league.”",

      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new signings in the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Diego Leon and Senne Lammens all arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd have had an underwhelming start to the season with their 2-1 win over Chelsea at the weekend coming at a crucial time for Ruben Amorim after pressure was building on the Portuguese head coach.",
      "And now Amorim and the Man Utd recruitment team are looking to give him more tools in the winter window to turn the Red Devils into a successful side.",
      "Man Utd have been heavily linked with Everton centre-back Branthwaite over the last couple of years and now journalist Mark Brus insists his ‘sources expect Man United to bid £60m’ for the England international, probably in January.",
      "READ: Why Manchester United traitor Paul Scholes went too far with his attack on Marcus Rashford",
      "With Harry Maguire’s future at Man Utd uncertain, Brus describes their interest in Branthwaite as ‘serious’ with the ‘unsettled’ Everton defender keen to join a ‘top club’ in the future.",
      "Revealing the current situation surrounding Maguire, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Maguire is still seen internally, after 250 appearances with Manchester United, as a leader in the dressing room, as a very important player, and this is why his future will be a point of discussion very soon.",
      "“Ruben Amorim really appreciates Harry Maguire’s mentality. People at the club respect what Maguire is trying to do for the young players arriving at the club now, and so, Maguire’s future will surely be a topic.”",
      "One player who is unlikely to have a future at Man Utd is Andre Onana with Romano claiming it’s unlikely that he will play for the Red Devils again.",
      "Romano added: “My understanding is that both sides – Man Utd and Andre Onana himself – see this Man Utd chapter as almost closed. So, it’s very difficult to imagine Onana staying at Man Utd beyond (next summer).",
      "“Man Utd believe that Senne Lammens is going to be the goalkeeper for present and future, so unless something extraordinary happens, (Onana’s agreement) is a straight loan, and he might go somewhere else in the future, but it’s over between Man Utd and Onana, probably.”",
      "Man Utd still need to sign a defensive midfielder in the next couple of transfer windows with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba one player they are interested in.",
      "On Baleba, Romano continued: “The last performance of Carlos Baleba for Brighton against Tottenham was a poor performance. It wasn’t of the level of a player like Baleba. After the game, the coach of Brighton, Fabian Hurzeler, was very honest. He said that when a young player like Baleba is linked to a team like Man Utd and the deal doesn’t happen, this can have an influence on his performance. It can have an impact.",
      "“Baleba wanted to go to Man Utd. But he’s always been respectful with Brighton. He was keen on the move. Personal terms were never going to be an issue. The problem was only Brighton and Man Utd. Brighton might consider let him go in 2026 but in 2025 it was always a no. That situation effected the player.",
      "“I’ve told you several times that Man Utd will keep a close eye on Baleba. He’s very much appreciated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "“These performances are not at a Baleba level yet.”",
      "West Ham are reportedly assessing potential replacements for Graham Potter with Slaven Bilic outlining his plan for a potential return.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Arsenal do not want negotiations with Real Madrid target William Saliba over a new contract to go into 2026, according transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Ruben Amorim is under immense pressure at Manchester United, and Fabrizio Romano’s new update on his future has hinted that he is quickly losing support…",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, there is one reason behind Manchester United’s decision on whether to offer a “new contract” to a key star."

How do you sleep in these days?” an increasingly incredulous Scholes asked, despite it long since having been reported that Rashford had been two minutes late because of a delay in filling out an electronic form, that he didn’t miss any of the pre-match preparations and indeed that he set up the third goal in a win over Valencia from the bench.",

      "But that is the sort of fabrication one can only expect from a professional pundit who “really struggles to feel happy for” someone whose sacrifices and shortcomings he really should almost uniquely understand.",
      "Scholes has an important platform and authoritative voice, but also an obligation to use those properly in an arena as highly charged as that of Manchester United. If he cannot relate to and explain the pressures a professional footballer faces at the elite level and the misjudgements that can sometimes force them to make, that reflects abysmally on him rather than Rashford.",
      "The line about how Rashford “actually quit on Manchester United, and once you quit once, you’ll quit again” stood out too, as did the references to his age no longer being a defence of his actions.",
      "And at 27 that is absolutely fair. Rashford should know better than many of the decisions he made towards the ostensible end of his Manchester United career suggested.",
      "He might also justifiably point out he could have “quit on Manchester United” far sooner instead of playing through the pain of back, shoulder and foot injuries to be the most-used player by Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and second for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But a 26-year-old Scholes would have been grateful not to face this constant level of withering censure and scrutiny when he made what has since been described as his biggest career regret.",
      "“I made a mistake,” Scholes has said of a moment his “head had just gone” in November 2001. “I did stupid things when I was a kid, when I was younger,” he added of refusing to play in a League Cup tie against Arsenal 24 hours after only getting 13 minutes from the bench in a defeat to Liverpool.",
      "Except he was no more “a kid” then than Rashford is now, no less responsible for his choices and actions. Scholes was fined two weeks’ wages, much as Rashford was during his infamous Belfast-based indiscretion at precisely the same age around 18 months ago.",
      "The difference is less in the players and far more in the club and its corroded culture. Manchester United in 2001 is the diametric opposite to Manchester United in 2025. The former was defined by the support network and sensational man-management of Sir Alex Ferguson; the latter protects nothing and no-one, exposing all it touches to toxicity and self-destruction.",
      "It is what Scholes and the rest of the “circle of Ferguson” so often overlook or take for granted. Their ludicrous talent aligned perfectly with the reign of a genius manager and elite structure which encouraged individual development and offered an environment in which players were protected. They speak from a position of immense ability and vast experience but also absurd fortune.",
      "Had this infernal brand of omnipresent Manchester United player-turned-pundit arrived a generation or two later, been saddled with hierarchical incompetence and intermittent coaching upheaval throughout their careers and had Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and Bill Foulkes seeking out every microphone ever manufactured to actively undermine and denigrate them at any opportunity, they too might have found it tough and ultimately decided that leaving was in the best interests of all parties.",
      "Rashford did so in the knowledge that bridges had been burned on both sides, not just his. He won’t have expected a pat on the back and a pledge of lifelong support from the fans in doing so, but it also feels entirely ridiculous for one of his presumed heroes to brand him a “disgrace” who he “really struggles to feel happy for” 10 months after his last appearance for a broken club he tried to carry as far as he could.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Nottingham Forest are absolutely rattling through all the giddy highs and infuriating lows that come with Ange Postecoglou. It is captivating to watch.",
      "Newcastle United beat Bradford City 4-1 and that really does prove a ‘masterstroke’ from Eddie Howe.",
      "Paul Scholes has received criticism for admitting he ‘struggles to feel happy’ for Marcus Rashford in Barcelona. But why should he?",
      "Eberechi Eze could be the genius Arsenal need but will he be allowed? He would probably get the chance at Liverpool.",
      "Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko are most at risk of being cast in one of the early season’s most embarrassing and undesirable modern roles."

      "Harry Kane reportedly has an exit clause in his Bayern Munich contract that could attract the attention of Premier League clubs Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Kane left Tottenham for Bayern ahead of the 2023/24 season and claimed the first trophy of his career in May, lifting the Bundesliga title.",
      "He has scored an extraordinary 98 goals in 103 matches for the German giants and has started this season in terrific form, registering 13 goals and three assists in seven appearances, including a brace against Chelsea in the Champions League last week.",
      "The 32-year-old will hit a century of goals for Bayern in only 104 games with a brace on Friday against Werder Bremen, which would make him the fastest player in Europe’s top-five leagues to reach that milestone. Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland both reached 100 goals in 105 games for Real Madrid and Manchester City, respectively.",
      "READ: Six left-field predictions of players who could win the 2026 Ballon d’Or",
      "Kane has been Bayern’s best and most consistent player since joining for around £100million, and they are reportedly in danger of losing him in the 2026 summer transfer window.",
      "According to German outlet Bild, there is an ‘exit clause in his contract’ worth €65million (£56.8m), though he would have to ‘announce his move in the winter’.",
      "That fee for a 33-year-old represents ‘a lot of money’ but also ‘could be dangerous for Bayern’, the report states.",
      "However, that ‘doesn’t even buy half the price of Alexander Isak’ and even if Kane stays in Germany until he’s 36, ‘a model professional like him would still be tearing the Bundesliga to pieces’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "Kane is said to still be keen to break the Premier League goalscoring record. It’s currently held by Alan Shearer with 260 goals. He himself has 213, all of which he’s scored for Tottenham. Should he return to his homeland in the summer after the 2026 World Cup, at the age of 33, he would have a prime chance of breaking the record.",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann recently said Kane has a clause in his contract allowing him to leave next summer and backed Manchester United to sign him.",
      "He Adventure Gamers: “I think Harry Kane has a clause that allows him to leave for a certain amount next summer. I believe the reason Bayern Munich wanted to bring Nick Woltemade in this summer was because many within the club think Kane wants to go back to England after the World Cup.",
      "“I can see Harry Kane at Manchester United next season, and I think he’d do well for them,” Hamann added.",
      "“Having said that, I always felt that as a London boy, sometimes they don’t really like to go to the north. Having played for Spurs, obviously Chelsea and Arsenal might be tricky, but then again, you never know, if they give him a chance to win the Premier League.",
      "“I always felt or thought that a London club would be more favourable than a northern club, but obviously United is probably still the biggest club in England, and if they were to ask for his services, I think it would be fantastic to see him as their number nine.”",
      "Gary Neville is doing his best to suggest Harry Kane might move to any other Premier League team other than Tottenham. Chelsea, anyone?",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘handed a dream scenario’ regarding Harry Kane, while they are ‘very close to’ their next signing.",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank admits that he “would like to see” Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane return to Spurs as soon as possible.",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",
      "Marcus Rashford winning the Ballon d’Or would be the most Manchester United banter era thing to ever happen.",
      "It’s that time of year again when we all question if we are watching the same game as the people who vote for the Ballon d’Or."

      "The head coach was still strongly backed in the summer, with Man Utd spending over £200m on new signings, most notably revamping their attack with the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After spending big, the Red Devils turned their attention to outgoings in the final weeks of the window.",

      "READ: Man Utd told to get Southgate ‘in to restructure the whole place’ at Amorim’s expense",
      "There was intense chatter over his future after he was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games, with clubs ranging from Real Madrid to Tottenham linked. But the hierarchy, led by INEOS’ Sir Jim Ratcliffe, had no desire to let the England midfielder leave on loan.",
      "Since then, Mainoo has had limited minutes: 45 off the bench against Burnley, 28 against Manchester City, three against Chelsea, and the full Carabao Cup second-round defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has previously boiled p*ss by saying Mainoo is competing for Bruno Fernandes’ position in the team, rather than competing with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to play next to the Man Utd captain.",
      "Fernandes is not getting dropped, especially in his current form, and with Ugarte failing to impress and Casemiro suspended after his red card against Chelsea, the clamour to see Mainoo start is growing even stronger.",
      "But spending a club-record fee on Baleba would all but nail Mainoo’s Old Trafford coffin shut. While Baleba’s arrival might excite fans, their academy graduate is the last player they want sacrificed to make it happen.",
      "From a boardroom perspective, Mainoo can be sold for pure profit, a godsend for the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, which only makes his potential departure more appealing.",
      "The prospect of losing him has already angered supporters, and if Football Insider is right that Man Utd will try again for Baleba in January, then the club are effectively willing to shove Mainoo out, whether deliberately or as collateral damage.",

      "Sources say that Ruben Amorim’s side are likely to go back in for the 21-year-old in January, and that speculation will increase again in the new year.",
      "However, United would struggle to complete a deal during the mid-season window due to Brighton’s reluctance to sell, and would have a better chance of signing the youngster next summer.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at over £100m… Despite this, the speculation is playing into the Red Devils’ hands, with the Cameroon international suffering a poor start to the season amid claims that his head has been turned.",
      "Indeed, Baleba’s head might well have been turned by the struggling Red Devils, and Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler suggested as much after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Spurs.",
      "“Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he’s a very young player,” Hurzeler said.",
      "“It’s all a lot of theory. We can only guess. For sure, when a young boy reads that there’s interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep. Even if he’s not saying, ‘It affects me,’ maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him.",
      "“It’s even part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, and to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and make the next step as a team.”",

      "Harry Kane tends to grab the headlines whenever Bayern do well – which they usually do – but one of their best-performing players is Michael Olise.",
      "Transferring from the Premier League is not always easy – just look at Sadio Mane – but a first season in Germany saw him contribute 30 combined goals and assists in 34 Bundesliga appearances.",

      "Against Newcastle, he put in a masterclass of a midfield performance and while the likes of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha may score the goals, Pedri ensures the team behind them ticks along nicely.",
      "But, Pedri need only ask Iniesta and Xavi when it comes to midfield players not being fairly represented at the Ballon d’Or. Rodri, Luka Modric and Kaka are the only midfielders to win it this century but what does work in Pedri’s favour is that he does not have Lionel Messi blocking his path.",

      "Let’s not forget that the Ballon d’Or is anot decided by robots but instead humans who can very much be swayed by sentimentality (see Messi in 2023). If Napoli do go deep, could we see a world where De Bruyne, who has only been in the top three once, is given the gong? Unlikely but yes we can.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",

      "Jamie Redknapp believes Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea is the biggest win of Ruben Amorim's reign at Old Trafford, while the Portuguese head coach has called for his side to build on their newfound momentum.",
      "United raced into a two-goal lead thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro following a red card for Robert Sanchez, but the result was thrown into question when the Brazil midfielder picked up his second yellow of the evening.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back for Chelsea with 10 minutes to go but Amorim's side held on - thanks to a defensive performance that Luke Shaw described as \"desperate\" after the game - to secure a much-needed win.",
      "United headed into the fixture with just four points from as many games, their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, but pressure will now be momentarily alleviated on Amorim and his squad after what was described by Redknapp as their \"biggest win\" since his appointment in November 2024.",
      "\"This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "United broke into the top half as a result of their win against Chelsea, with games against Brentford and Sunderland now on the horizon before the October international break.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim remained level-headed regarding his team's performance and called for them to create momentum moving forward.",
      "\"I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls.",
      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two.",
      "\"We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "Pressure had been ramped up on Amorim and his side in the build-up to the visit of Chelsea, which arrived as the following fixture to a dismal 3-0 defeat to local rivals Manchester City.",
      "Speaking after that loss, both Gary Neville and Roy Keane outlined their worries for United, with the former saying a loss to Chelsea would have caused \"big questions\" to be asked of Amorim.",
      "The United boss continued: \"People don't have too many good things to say about our team and our results.",
      "\"I understand that, I'm just joking around all the time. I have nothing to say to the critics; they are right most of the time. But we won, and that's a good thing for us.",
      "\"It's really important because I understand the environment around the team and the coach. This game was really important for that. It's Manchester United winning a game at home, it's just that.\"",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40m move to Chelsea after being told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Asked if the transfer could backfire on Man Utd, Amorim said: \"I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",

      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited the training ground to meet with Ruben Amorim this week following their poor start to the season; Amorim: \"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win\"",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 14:16, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has played down the significance of a meeting with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe at the club's training ground this week, insisting their talks were \"normal\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe's visit.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",
      "\"I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.",
      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",
      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",
