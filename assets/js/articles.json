      "Viktor Gyokeres made it clear to Manchester United that he didn't want to join them - which left them to instead pursue Matheus Cunha. The Sporting Lisbon striker has been linked with a reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "However the Swedish striker has no desire to head to Old Trafford and the Red Devils have had to go after other options. Gyokeres wants to remain playing in the Champions League and United cannot offer that, but a move to Arsenal may yet materialise.",
      "Gyokeres has excelled in Portugal since moving from Coventry City. This term he scored more than 50 times as he landed the double with Sporting, but attention soon turned to his next move.",
      "The Swede scored a crucial equaliser from the penalty spot in the 11th minute of added time to force the Portuguese Cup into extra time before they eventually downed Lisbon rivals Benfica. Gyokeres' next move remained front and centre afterwards.",
      "He said on his future: “Let us see. It’s hard for me to say, because yeah it is football and you never know what’s going to happen in the summer. So for me to say anything else than that is impossible.”",
      "Asked specifically about the Gunners he added: “I don’t know, I just focus on this. I’ve tried to focus on the last games because it’s so important and I don’t want to think about anything else. So yeah, if anything is true, let’s see in the summer.”",
      "United meanwhile are going after Cunha and are ready to pay his release clause, which is just over £60m. The forward was a major reason in Wolves steering themselves clear of the drop and Amorim believes he will suit his system as he eyes reinforcements.",
      "Those from Manchester are also looking to land Liam Delap from Ipswich. The young striker has excelled in the Premier League with Chelsea also keen, but the Red Devils missing out on the Champions League could cost them another target with the Blues having that in their favour.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Marcus Rashford insists Aston Villa will \"come back stronger\" after they missed out on the Champions League on the final day of the Premier League. A loss at his parent club Manchester United meant they finished sixth and qualified for the Europa League.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa Park on loan midway through the season and was able to rediscover his best form but now faces an uncertain future having fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The forward was crucial to Villa's impressive form in the final months of the season, but a hamstring injury meant he missed the final weeks of the campaign. He's been a big hit nevertheless with Villa having a £40million option to sign Rashford permanently.",
      "The player is thought to be keen on a move to Barcelona, but remaining in the Midlands is also a possibility. Rashford has paid tribute to all those at Villa and maintained they would be better for their experience as they narrowly missed out on successive seasons in the Champions League.",
      "He said on social media: \"Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me. It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from 1st minute on the pitch.",
      "\"Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",
      "Rashford managed to make himself a regular, dislodging Ollie Watkins for the European games with PSG. During his spell the loanee scored four times and continued to have a huge influence in the final third.",
      "Villa will remain seething at the series of events that saw them miss out on the top five. Their loss at Old Trafford came after a refereeing blunder saw their opening goal ruled out. Morgan Rogers was deemed to have fouled the goalkeeper and the ref blew before his shot crossed the line.",
      "It meant that VAR could not intervene as Villa were left to bemoan the appointment of referee Thomas Bramall, who was relatively inexperienced. A complaint has been lodged with the authorities as the club said: \"We acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",

      "A historically poor season at Manchester United has seen Ruben Amorim foot the bill left by some of his predecessors. But perhaps no transfer misstep is more glaring right now than the decision to sell Scott McTominay, something Sir Alex Ferguson tried to warn the club against.",
      "Erik ten Hag was still at the Old Trafford helm when the Red Devils made the decision to end McTominay's 22-year tenure, having first linked up with United at the age of five. And the club's lack of foresight has been highlighted once again after the Scot won Serie A in his debut campaign for Napoli, as well as being named the league's Player of the Season.",
      "McTominay, 28, spearheaded Antonio Conte's charge to a 10th career Scudetto (five as a player, five as a coach) with 12 goals and six assists. Only six players scored more in Italy's top flight this term, and needless to say, that contribution could have been used by a United team that just set a new record low for goals scored in a Premier League season (44).",
      "Not bad for a £25.7million investment deemed surplus to requirements by his boyhood club. Ferguson's admiration of the player is well documented, and it was during the days under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that the United great made it clear he felt McTominay deserved to be a prominent part of the XI.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Man United's big players,\" Ferguson told the Scottish FA in 2021. \"When you watch Man United pick their team for a big game, McTominay's name is in it. He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "That testimony to the player's moral fibre describes exactly the profile of player Amorim could have used more this season. Too often did United take the lead in games this season, only to welcome pressure upon themselves, while their 18 defeats are the most they've recorded in a league campaign in more than half a century.",
      "To Ten Hag's credit, the Dutchman said in October that he \"didn't want\" to see McTominay leave in a decision that was more so pushed by the club. McTominay appeared to confirm as much in December when he told the BBC Football Daily podcast Financial Fair Play (FFP) was a factor.",
      "Much of United's transfer travails in the post-Ferguson era come down to prioritising the wrong profile of player. The club has spent vast sums bringing in big names or expensive prospects who often don't fit the bill in their positions, frequently overlooking certain intangibles that McTominay possesses.",
      "\"I signed [McTominay] when he was seven or eight years of age and he was actually a centre-forward as a kid,\" added Ferguson in 2021. \"He's just sprouted, a little bit like Darren Fletcher. Darren had a few little annoying injuries as he was growing and needed some rest periods and things like that.",
      "\"McTominay is of a similar type to Darren - long, lanky, good winner of the ball and a good turn of pace going forward, a great attitude to the game. All these attitudes that Darren Fletcher had, he's got them.\"",
      "Ferguson, 83, developed a knack for recruiting somewhat under-the-radar talents who made his teams greater than the sum of their parts. And these players often had a hand in making the glossier names on the team sheet shine, with Park Ji-sung, Nemanja Vidic and John O'Shea perhaps among the best examples.",
      "The £25m or so United received for McTominay's signature may look like a pittance now, considering what he has achieved in Italy. It's fair to say the Red Devils' loss was Napoli's gain as he took to Italian football with ease, displaying the kind of all-action midfield presence that was plain to see in his last season at Old Trafford."

      "Ruben Amorim reduced his Sporting CP squad to tears when he left the club in November to take the reins of Manchester United. The Portuguese tactician enjoyed a stellar four-year stint with the Primeira Liga side between 2020 and 2024, winning three league titles and three domestic cups before the Red Devils spent £11million to bring him and his coaching staff to Old Trafford.",
      "And while Amorim has had a far-from-stellar season with United, winning just eight Premier League games since taking over from Erik ten Hag and finishing a record low 15th in the standings, it is clear that the 40-year-old is able to build budding relationships with his players.",
      "That is, of course, if his former Sporting CP squad's opinions of him are anything to go off. As per Abola, Eduardo Quaresma broke down in tears in the wake of Amorim leaving the club last year, telling the publication: \"I was sad, we had a very good relationship with the manager, I feel sad for him, he deserves everything good.",
      "\"I don't believe it. There were times when I didn't believe it would happen. I don't know if I can say it. We had a meeting and he said to us, 'Guys, I don't know anything, trust me.'",
      "\"The next game, the guy said he was leaving, but he stayed for another four games. All I could think was, 'Go away'. I cried a lot. I think I cried the most.\"",
      "Quaresma was not the only player who was emotional as Amorim parted ways with the European stalwarts either, with Pedro Goncalves also noting an incredibly strong relationship with his former manager. The attacking midfielder said: \"I wouldn't be here today [without him].",
      "\"We had a very strong bond, both professionally and personally. He liked my wife very much and was concerned about my well-being, both on the field and in my family life.",
      "\"He knew when players were happy or sad, and he knew exactly what to say. We were sad. I started crying because I really liked him, and I was sad. I never told him not to go; I wished him good luck. The players understood. He was like a father to us. We were sad, but we understood. I wish him the best of luck.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Maximiliano Araujo, who was brought to the Jose Alvalade by Amorim last summer, highlighted the impact that the manager had on not only him, but the squad as a whole. He revealed to Abola his disappointment in seeing Amorim leave for United: \"It was normal.",
      "\"I noticed it, yes, in many of my team-mates, because it was normal. That's what I'm telling you. When you have a really good coach like that, you don't want him to leave. When so many players cry... I have no doubt that many players felt a lot of affection for him. And, yes, it was a bit difficult. As I say... it was normal, understandable, given all the affection the players felt for him.\"",
      "After Amorim's exit from Sporting CP, Joao Pereira took the reins of the club for a month before he was replaced by Rui Borges in December.",
      "And the 43-year-old not only managed to guide his team to a Taca de Portugal trophy, but also to beat rivals Benfica to a Liga Portugal title by two points. It comes as Amorim held his hands up for a lacklustre first season at Old Trafford, as he has failed to get his inherited squad to adapt to his patented style of play.",
      "While the manager was able to oversee a 2-0 win over Aston Villa during Sunday's seasonal finale at Old Trafford - courtesy of goals from Amad and Christian Eriksen - the victory came as all but a consolation prize from an otherwise dreadful term. Addressing fans from the pitch after the full-time whistle, Amorim said: \"First of all, I want to apologise for this season.",
      "\"I know you are really disappointed with me, and really disappointed with the team. Second thing, I want to say thank you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, and I know that was really hard.",
      "\"I know it was really hard in many ways, but now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past - because this season is in the past. It's over. We fight each other, or we stick together and move forward.",
      "\"Six months ago, in my first three games in charge with two victories and one draw, I said to you, 'The storm is coming.' Today, after this disaster season, I want to tell you, the good days are coming. If there is one club in the world that proved in the past, that can overcome any situation, any disaster, it's our club. It's Manchester United Football Club.",
      "\"Now I want to say sorry also to my players. Sometimes I was not fair, but I tried always to be honest to you guys. Thank you very much, see you next season.\"",

      "Having joined the Red Devils from Ajax in 2022, Ten Hag won two trophies - the League Cup and FA Cup - over the course of his tumultuous tenure. Ten Hag's position was under threat last season following an eighth-place finish before United's new hierarchy decided on keeping him.",
      "The ex-Ajax, Utrecht and Go Ahead Eagles boss was then backed with £200million in the summer, but failure to improve results led to his dismissal. Ten Hag was patient after departing Old Trafford, focussing on ventures outside of football.",
      "It's understood that he wanted to wait until the summer to return to management. And his patience has paid off with a move to former Bundesliga champions Leverkusen.",
      "Ten Hag said: \"Bayer 04 are one of the best clubs in Germany and also among the top clubs in Europe. The club offers outstanding conditions, I've been very impressed with the discussions of the management.",
      "\"I've come to Leverkusen to continue with the ambition shown in recent years. It's an attractive challenge to set up something together in this period of change and develop an ambitious team.\"",
      "Sporting director Simon Rolfes added: \"With Erik ten Hag we have brought in an experienced coach with impressive success on the pitch. His six title wins at Ajax were exceptional. With three league titles and two domestic cup wins he and Ajax dominated Dutch football from 2018 to 2022.",
      "\"And Erik demonstrated his quality as a coach with the ensuing success at Manchester United under difficult circumstances at times. Our ideas of football coincide. With technically demanding and dominant football, we want to carry on in the Werkself style and aim for the highest targets in the Bundesliga, DFB Pokal and Champions League.\"",
      "They've confirmed that Ten Hag has signed a contract until 2027. Unfortunately for the 55-year-old, he's set to miss out on the chance to coach some of Leverkusen's best players who helped them win the title in 2024.",
      "Defender Jonathan Tah has opted not to sign a new contract and will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer. Meanwhile, star attacker Florian Wirtz and highly-rated wing-back Jeremie Frimpong are both in talks to join Liverpool, potentially banking Leverkusen close to £150m.",

      "Recently, Ten Hag opened on life outside of coaching. \"There are so many other things I could do,\" he told the SEG Stories podcast. \"Maybe in football, in a new position as a manager. That's an option. And maybe something completely different.\"",
      "\"I've been working with my brothers lately. We have our own company. Or rather; they have their own company. But we also run a company together with our father. That's also something I love to do I can now give that more attention and it's also a lot of fun.\""

      "Manchester United are set to strip Marcus Rashford of the No.10 shirt and give it to the incoming Matheus Cunha. The Red Devils are understood to have reached a full agreement to sign Wolves star Cunha, handing him a long-term contract until 2030 with the option of an additional 12 months.",
      "United will pay the Brazilian's £62.5million release clause and make him their first signing of the summer transfer window. Cunha, 25, impressed Old Trafford chiefs after firing Wolves to safety with 15 goals and six assists in the Premier League.",
      "Entering his peak years and proven in the English top flight, the ex-Atletico Madrid forward is viewed as the ideal signing to transform Ruben Amorim's goal-shy attack. Cunha was the subject of interest from Arsenal and Nottingham Forest in the January transfer window, but despite not playing in Europe next season, United have convinced him to head north.",
      "talkSPORT claim that in order to sweeten the deal, Cunha will be given the No.10 shirt. Rashford has sported the number since 2018 but after being made available for transfer, he'll reportedly lose it.",
      "The England international has no future under Amorim, who sanctioned his loan to Aston Villa in January. Rashford wasn't included in United's 32-man squad for their post-season trip to Asia this week which comes after their 2-0 win against 10-man Villa on Sunday.",
      "While Amorim was giving a speech to the Old Trafford crowd and vowed that 'the good times are coming', Cunha appeared to wave goodbye to Molineux, where he's spent the last two-and-a-half seasons. The 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes as Wolves drew 1-1 at home to Brentford.",
      "Boss Vitor Pereira has remained tight-lipped on the situation, saying last week: \"I have the same information as you. I don't know. I just know he's my player.",
      "\"He's committed with the team, he's working with happiness and we will see what happens. You must ask him. He is happy. I feel he is happy.\"",
      "Pereira added on Friday; \"As soon as possible we'll have a clear picture of the squad and we can start our work. If we lose players with quality, we must replace them, because next season we want to be better than this season.",
      "\"It's time to understand the players we need to balance the squad and to look forward at players. Usually they propose some players, me and my staff check them, and in the end we decide. It's not about money because I don't know business, but about the quality of the players.\""

      "That's it then: the 2024-25 Premier League season is officially in the books and it was one to remember for Arne Slot and Liverpool.",
      "Few people fancied the Reds to win the title in the Dutchman's first year at the helm. But Slot handled the unenviable task of slipping into Jurgen Klopp's sizeable shoes with ease to make history at the expense of Arsenal, who have to make do with silver for a third successive year.",
      "Then it got interesting. After a frenetic final day Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle booked themselves their spots in the Champions League. Aston Villa will feel aggrieved after a controversial refereeing decision cost them at Manchester United - and they now have to make do with the Europa League.",
      "Things at the bottom have been decided for months. The three who came up are going straight back down. In truth Leicester, Southampton and Ipswich have struggled to put up much of a fight.",
      "We've had some shining lights, as we always do, in England's top flight. Some have come out of nowhere, others have been as brilliant as usual. Equally we've had individuals who have massively underwhelmed.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Come on, who gave him a shot? To go into a mega club, following a legend - and then winning the title by an absolute country mile. What a story. He has done it brilliantly, too. Managing the squad, fitness and overseeing incredible consistency.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "I am sick and tired of managers saying they are going to stick to their principles. What? At the expense of results? If you do not have the players to play a certain formation, then change. It is a weakness and inflexibilibity. Not a strength. He has underperformed to whole new levels.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Goals, assists and highlights. I love the way he has taken his game to new levels. Just brilliant. He has lit up the Premier League.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Dean Huijsen",
      "I love this player. And it also allows me to give a big hat tip to Bournemouth for a terrific season. Bought for a modest price, sold to Real Madrid for £50m. What a season.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Seeing the bottom three go down again. That’s two years running. That impacts on the Premier League. The top five has been supremely competitive. The bottom three boring, predictable and hopeless. That is what you get when the gap is too big. It’s a huge worry for all. I excuse Ipswich as they gave it a go - but even they fell so short.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "What a signing. £12m from Fiorentina. One of the best stories of the season. I’d have him in my Team of the Year. Uncompromising, strong and defiant. Terrific. Incredible player for Forest. I’ve done about six double takes to check it was just last summer and the price. Brilliant business.",
      "Worst transfer: Riccardo Calafiori",
      "I want to be absolutely clear here. I like Calafiori and I think he’s such a good player (even though Arsenal spent £42m on a player with a bad injury record). But Arsenal bought a left back when they already had left backs coming out of their ears. And they needed a striker. Any striker. Just a striker. And they signed a left back. That is why Arsenal fell short. Awful transfer business.",
      "Biggest moment: Mo Salah celebrating the title at Anfield in front of the Kop. Just beautiful. Five years ago, there were no fans. This time it was for the fans. What a great season and story.",
      "Team of the year: Crystal Palace",
      "I’ll be clear. My team of the year was Liverpool. But I’ve given them manager, player and moment. I want to celebrate Palace and their FA Cup win. Amazing. To win against one of the teams in English football history in Manchester City, is just sensational. But it was the fans. Oliver Glasner. They turned Wembley blue and red. What an upset. They wrote their name into FA Cup folklore and won the first trophy in their history. I loved it.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Came in to replace Jurgen Klopp, big shoes to fill but he didn't walk in the German's path. He created his own and took Liverpool to the Premier League title.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric",
      "Few candidates but how Southampton went down without a fight after he replaced Russell Martin was, quite frankly, pathetic. Doubt we will see him in England again.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Only one winner. Outstanding goal return, loads of assists and one of the main reasons Liverpool are champions of England.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Ryan Gravenberch",
      "Didn't look like that smart of a signing last season when he joined from Bayern Munich and had little impact. But in his new No 6 role under Arne Slot, he became one of the best players this season in the Premier League.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Kobbie Mainoo",
      "After his breakthrough last season, we expected so much from the player who scored in the FA Cup final and started for England in the Euros final but injuries, manager change and a struggle to fit into a new system has seen him struggle for most of the campaign. Will be hoping to bounce back next term.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "Signed for £12m from Juventus and sold for £50m already to Real Madrid. From a financial perspective it couldn't have been a better move from Bournemouth but the Spain defender was also brilliant this season for the Cherries.",
      "Worst transfer: Jadon Sancho",
      "\"Freedom\" he said about Marcus Rashford's move to Aston Villa but he didn't use his own \"freedom\" to prove Manchester United wrong and now Chelsea are going to pay £5m to send him back instead of taking up the £25m obligation to buy him. That tells its own story.",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning FA Cup",
      "Their first ever major trophy and beating big boys Manchester City at Wembley. The scenes were epic and it should be a reminder to every mid-table team manager who plays a weakened team in the Cup what those days can bring for fans.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Sometimes a new manager doesn’t need to take a sledgehammer to what’s gone before, and instead just needs a subtle touch. That’s what Slot brought to Anfield, tweaking things here and there with the same players that Jurgen Klopp had in his final season as they finished off the title pace. He rejuvenated some players, got a little bit extra out of others and led them to the title, comfortably, with an understated confidence throughout.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "Arrived at Manchester United with a growing reputation, supposedly the ace who was meant to right the ship and turn them into challengers once again. Instead, seven months down the line, he looks like little more than a busted flush. It’s going to take some turnaround next season to prove he isn’t just someone able to do it in a second tier league but found badly wanting in our top flight; the Ricky van Wolfswinkel of Premier League managers, if you will.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "For the majority of the season, has been on another level to the rest of the Premier League. Hat tips to Newcastle’s Alexander Isak and Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who doesn’t get anywhere near the credit he deserves.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Pau Cubarsi",
      "OK it’s not the Premier League, but for the Barcelona defender to do what he’s done in his first full season at senior level, to play as many games, with seemingly a different partner every other week - not to mention in Hansi Flick’s ridiculously aggressive defensive line - all at the age of 18 is nothing short of incredible.",
      "Biggest disappointment: West Ham",
      "It couldn’t be Manchester United, because seeing that level of failure while Sir Jim Ratcliffe sacks staff left, right and centre while pleading poverty at a club with revenues the size of theirs isn’t a disappointment.",
      "Tottenham save themselves thanks to their Europa League triumph and Joao Felix doesn’t get picked either because I’m still uncertain if he’s a beautiful mirage or not.",
      "So I’ll go with West Ham. Julen Lopetegui spent a lot and some of his press pals gave it the big build up - then continued to make clear how right he was and how it was everybody else who was wrong as things went from bad to worse. It's not got much better under Graham Potter either.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "In these days of everyone wanting defenders who can play, it’s good to see a big solid unit just being absolutely dominant in his own box and defending like his life depends on it. Has been brilliant for Forest for only £12million.",
      "Worst transfer: Riccardo Calafiori",
      "He cost £47million when they already had two left-backs - and then had Myles Lewis-Skelly coming through anyway! He’s not a bad player the Italian, but it wasn’t necessary from Arsenal when they had obvious other needs.",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning the FA Cup",
      "Quite simply what football is all about.",
      "Team of the year: David Raya; Daniel Munoz, Nikola Milenkovic, Virgil van Dijk, Marc Cucurella; Alexis Mac Allister, Bruno Guimaraes, Declan Rice; Mo Salah, Bryan Mbeumo; Alexander Isak",
      "Best manager:",
      "It’s got to be Arne Slot - he had the good sense to leave the side he inherited from Jurgen Klopp alone, like Claudio Ranieri inheriting Nigel Pearson’s team at Leicester in 2015, and they both won the title unexpectedly.",
      "Worst manager:",
      "In a crowded field, it’s got to be Ruben Amorim - not just for finishing the season without a trophy at Manchester United, but his refusal to adapt that sacrosanct 3-4-3 formation. Systems don’t win football matches, players do. Stick to your principles or stick ‘em in the bin? Amorim’s given us all the answer.",
      "Best player:",
      "Mo Salah - the Egyptian king’s contract stand-off at Anfield was a distraction from his 29 goals and 18 assists. Absolutely phenomenal.",
      "Best breakthrough season:",
      "Dean Huiijsen - if you’d never heard of him before this season, he was the £50 million defender snapped up by Real Madrid after an impressive season for Bournemouth.",
      "Biggest disappointment:",
      "West Ham - a wasted season. Julen Lopetegui wasn’t an obvious fit at the Taxpayers Stadium and his results soon showed why. In a year when Tottenham and Crystal Palace won trophies, the Hammers weren’t even at the races.",
      "Best transfer:",
      "Nikola Milenkovic - he brought steel and assurance to Nottingham Forest’s unlikely pursuit of Champions League football. OK, they ended up in the Thursday Night Smorgasbord Conference, but at £12m he was a steal.",
      "Worst transfer:",
      "Raheem Sterling - his season on loan at Arsenal yielded a solitary goal, against Bolton in the League Cup, and he spent most of it on the bench. At Euro 2020 he was England’s best player, but his star has fallen so far even astronomers can’t find it in the solar system now.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser for Everton in the last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Bedlam, controversy, madness, passion. All the things we love about football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Rice, Gravenberch, Guimaraes; Salah, Isak, Eze.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Worst manager: Julen Lopetegui",
      "Best player: Mohamed Salah",
      "Best breakthrough season: Morgan Rogers",
      "Biggest disappointment: Premier League teams against PSG",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "Worst transfer: Nico Gonzalez",
      "Biggest moment: Rodri’s injury",
      "Team of the year: Raya; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Rice; Salah, Wissa, Isak",
      "For all the impressive work done by some of the Premier League’s surprise packages this season, it’s hard to look past dominant champions Liverpool. In other years, Nuno Espirito Santo’s efforts might earn him manager of the year, but Arne Slot’s seamless work after following Jurgen Klopp earns him the nod.",
      "Forest do get a nod in my team of the year, with Nikola Milenkovic gelling brilliantly with Murillo in one of the most impressive defences in the league. Matz Sels and Chris Wood are also close to inclusion but just miss out, with Liverpool and Arsenal the only teams with multiple representatives - though it’s worth noting that none of Arsenal’s three are attackers.",
      "Former Manchester City youngster Morgan Rogers edges out his one-time Under-21s colleague Liam Delap in the breakthrough category by virtue of his Champions League exploits, but both have shown they’re more than ready to thrive at this level.",
      "The biggest disappointments - aside from PSG going three for three against English sides in the Champions League knockouts - are two Spaniards. Julen Lopetegui wasted a big-spending summer in his half-season at West Ham, while £49m Nico Gonzalez hasn’t even been Manchester City’s best Nico, let alone their best player.",
      "City’s title defence - or lack thereof - has been the story of the season. Rodri’s September injury accelerated their decline, and his return could yet be one of the factors when the time comes for end-of-season assessments 12 months from now.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "It is hard to look past a man who wins the title in their first season in the Premier League despite having made no major signings. Slot has led Liverpool roaring to top spot, easily handling the job of replacing Jurgen Klopp.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "At the other end of the scale, Ruben Amorim has been disastrous for Manchester United. He has won just six Premier League games, with a points per game average of 0.92. If he'd have been in charge for the full season, United may well have been in a relegation battle.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Once again, I'm going route one with this award. Mo Salah has been by far the best player in the Premier League this term. In a season in which his contract was expiring, Salah has delivered a historic performance, scoring 33 goals and notching 23 assists in all competitions.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "The 18-year-old made his debut back in September as a last second sub in Arsenal's draw with Manchester City. He has since become the Gunners' first-choice left-back and looks set to enjoy a successful career at the top level.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Phil Foden",
      "The reigning Premier League Player of the Year has endured a woeful season. He has scored just seven goals and notched only two assists in the top-flight. The midfielder looks far from the player many pundits wanted England to build their team around.",
      "Best transfer: Liam Delap",
      "OK so Ipswich went down, but Liam Delap has enjoyed an impressive season leading the line for the Tractor Boys. The striker has scored 12 goals and notched two assists. He looks likely to leave Portman Road in a £40m deal this summer.",
      "Worst transfer: Manuel Ugarte",
      "Bought for £50million, Manuel Ugarte has endured a difficult debut season in the Premier League. He has failed to solve United's midfield problems and has struggled to convince boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski's goal vs Liverpool",
      "With just seconds remaining of the final Merseyside Derby at Goodison Park, Everton were trailing 2-1. But then James Tarkowski smashed in a volley to equalise, sending the Toffees into delirium. It had the added benefit of ensuring that the Merseyside Derby record at Goodison Park ended up with 41 wins for each side and 38 draws.",
      "Team of the year: Matz Sels; Tino Livramento; Virgil van Dijk, Nikola Milenkovic, Milos Kerkz; Youri Tielemans, Declan Rice, Bruno Guimaraes; Mo Salah, Chris Wood, Josh Murphy",
      "Best manager: Nuno Espirito Santo",
      "It's sometimes forgotten in this era that a manager's job is to make the best of the players that he has and win games. For me, no one has done that better than Nuno Espirito Santo, doubling Nottingham Forest's points tally from last season, a Premier League first.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric",
      "I liked him in Italy but sorry, you can't escape his abysmal results.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Talismanic.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Ryan Gravenberch",
      "A lesson in not judging players too early. Good job for him that Liverpool never signed Martin Zubimendi.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Manchester United",
      "All change at the top yet the same mess on the pitch. But the Europe-less nadir that they've reached could actually force a hard reset.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "Talk about turning a profit, he cost Bournemouth £12.6million and was sold to Real Madrid for £50m just 34 appearances later.",
      "Worst transfer: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall",
      "Premier League-only, of course. Chelsea paid £30m for 258 minutes of football.",
      "Biggest moment: Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City",
      "The power truly shifted that day.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Munoz, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Hall; Mac Allister, Tonali, Rice; Salah, Isak, Mbeumo",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot.",
      "Boring answer, but anyone who tells you they thought he’d win the league in his first season, with Federico Chiesa as the only summer signing is lying.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim.",
      "I bought into the hype, but it’s been a car crash so far – United’s squad is poor but he should’ve done far better and there have been some indefensible decisions along the way.",
      "Best player: Mohamed Salah.",
      "He’s tailed off a little of late – who can blame him? – but he’s been absolutely electric.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Jacob Murphy.",
      "At the age of 30, it has all clicked for the Newcastle winger, who is a lot better than I thought he was. A great story.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Southampton.",
      "Russell Martin’s style of play was always going to lead to some hairy moments, but they’ve been an embarrassment, plumbing the depths of Premier League history.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic.",
      "Everything you want from a signing: he was a bargain at £12m, has played every week for Nottingham Forest and been extremely consistent.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix.",
      "He cost £45m and has one Premier League goal. A player Chelsea didn’t need but went for anyway. A colossal waste who epitomises Chelsea’s buy now and question later policy.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski's last-minute equaliser vs Liverpool.",
      "A wonderful bit of unfiltered raw emotion in the last Merseyside Derby at Goodison Park.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Livramento, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Mac Allister, Rice, Rogers; Salah, Mbeumo, Isak.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Winning PL in first season is not to be sniffed at although if Nuno secures top-five, he’s my manager of season.",
      "Worst manager: Julen Lopetegui",
      "Shocking, should never have landed the job, wasn’t an upgrade on David Moyes.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Slowed down but in the thick of it, Salah provided big moments and put huge numbers on board again.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Liam Delap",
      "Always been highly rated but cracked the Prem to prove he belongs at this level.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Man Utd",
      "Ridiculous season having spent big again last summer.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "Bargain, colossal at the back for Forest, incredible business.",
      "Worst transfer: Sterling to Arsenal",
      "Spent a lot of time contacting people about this deal on deadline day and it was effectively much ado about nothing, really poor for all parties.",
      "Biggest moment: Palace winning FA Cup",
      "Not Prem related but a monumental achievement and underdog story that restores your faith in football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Munoz, Van Dijk, Milenkovic, Kerkez; Mac Allister, Rice, Gibbs-White; Salah, Mbeumo, Isak.",
      "Best manager: Oliver Glasner",
      "I know Arne Slot won the title in his first season but Oliver Glasner won Crystal Palace’s first trophy after 164 years.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric/Russell Martin",
      "Take your pick at Southampton but they had no chance of survival after one win in 16 under Russell Martin.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Honourable mention to Alexander Isak but Mo Salah has been different class.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "The Serbian centre-back has been an outstanding signing for Nottingham Forest.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Chelsea.",
      "A team of inexperienced players with an inexperienced manager.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen.",
      "Bought for £13m from Juventus and sold for £50m to Real Madrid after an excellent season at Bournemouth.",
      "Worst transfer: Raheem Sterling.",
      "Arsenal desperately needed a goalscorer. They took the Chelsea winger on loan and he scored one Carabao Cup goal in 27 appearances.",
      "Biggest moment: Liverpool 2 Man City 0 February 23.",
      "The official changing of the guard at the top of the Premier League.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Liverpool fans won’t like it but the fact that the Dutchman has won the title in his first season in England indicates that Jurgen Klopp might not have been the genius they claimed.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "An easy conclusion given that Amorim himself reckons he’s the worst manager in United’s history.",
      "Best player: Virgil van Dijk",
      "The Kop captain has been the rock on which the title success has been built.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "It’s always great to see a talented young player emerge at the club he supports. But Lewis-Skelly also has a bit of devil about him that makes him extra special. His Erling Haaland impression was a stand-out moment.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Refereeing standards and VAR",
      "And Howard Webb trying to suggest our officials are doing a good job is offensive.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "An absolute steal at £13m - and any club that meets his £60m buy-out will also be getting a bargain.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix",
      "Spending £46million on the Portuguese striker may have been driven by FFP and PSR considerations but has there ever been a bigger waste of money?",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning the first trophy in their history and what it meant to their fans.",
      "Team of the year: Newcastle edged out Nottingham Forest on the final day. For Eddie Howe to win the club’s first major trophy for 70 years AND qualify for the Champions League means he’s surely going to get a statue commissioned.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "There are other worthy contenders, such as Nottingham Forest's Nuno Espirito Santo and Newcastle's Eddie Howe, but to win the title in his first season at Liverpool, with effectively the same squad he inherited from Jurgen Kloop, was a remarkable achievement from Slot.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "Manchester United fans may sing his name and he may yet turn the club around in time, but seven wins from 28 Premier League games is shocking and would have seen them in danger of relegation in any other season.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "An obvious choice, but with 29 goals and 18 assists in the Premier League this season, a modern-day record for goal involvements, it is hard to look beyond the Liverpool forward as player of the season.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "He only made his first Premier League start in December, but the left-back, 18, has made the position his own and earned an England call-up with his fearless attitude and confidence on the ball.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Manchester United",
      "Even with the upheaval of changing managers mid-season, to finish 15th and lose 18 games is wholly unacceptable for such a big club, with the calibre of players they have and the financial resources at their disposal.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "The Serbia defender had an incredible debut season for Forest after signing from Fiorentina for £12million, forming a formidable central defensive partnership with Murillo and taking them to the brink of the Champions League, until the final day.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix",
      "Once regarded as one of Europe's hottest young talents, Chelsea spent £45m on the 25-year-old, who made three Premier League starts before being shipped out on loan to AC Milan. A calamitous and costly signing.",
      "Biggest moment: Manchester City's collapse",
      "Maybe not a single moment, more of a seismic spell, but City's return of five points from 27 from November 2 to December 26 was the shock of the season, given their relentless consistency of recent years, and ultimately handed the title to Liverpool.",
      "Team of the year: Liverpool",
      "Again, there are other worthy contenders, such as Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, but winning the Premier League at a canter, with a new manager at the helm, following a managerial icon in Jurgen Klopp, makes Arne Slot's side the team of the year.",
      "Best manager: It’s got to be Arne Slot - he had the good sense to leave the side he inherited from Jurgen Klopp alone, like Claudio Ranieri inheriting Nigel Pearson’s team at Leicester in 2015, and they both won the title unexpectedly.",
      "Worst manager: In a crowded field, it’s got to be Ruben Amorim - not just for finishing the season without a trophy at Manchester United, but his refusal to adapt that sacrosanct 3-4-3 formation. Systems don’t win football matches, players do. Stick to your principles or stick ‘em in the bin? Amorim’s given us all the answer.",

      "Biggest disappointment: West Ham - a wasted season. Julen Lopetegui wasn’t an obvious fit at the Taxpayers Stadium and his results soon showed why. In a year when Tottenham and Crystal Palace won trophies, the Hammers weren’t even at the races.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic - he brought steel and assurance to Nottingham Forest’s unlikely pursuit of Champions League football. OK, they ended up in the Thursday Night Smorgasbord Conference, but at £12m he was a steal.",
      "Worst transfer: Raheem Sterling - his season on loan at Arsenal yielded a solitary goal, against Bolton in the League Cup, and he spent most of it on the bench. At Euro 2020 he was England’s best player, but his star has fallen so far even astronomers can’t find it in the solar system now.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser for Everton in the last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Bedlam, controversy, madness, passion. All the things we love about football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Rice, Gravenberch, Guimaraes; Salah, Isak, Eze.",

      "Villa boss Unai Emery said: “The key moment was of course the goal and how the referee decided the action. He knows he made a mistake. With this goal, maybe we could get a better result and a Champions League place, but we didn’t deserve more than the result we got.”",
      "Villa captain John McGinn said: “It’s tough to take in the circumstances. The decision is incredible. It's so hard to take, especially with the impact that it has on us. As a team and as a club, it's so big.",
      "“We didn’t deserve to win, but at that point you’re 1-0 up with 20 minutes to go, and all you need is a point to get in the Champions League, so it’s a really costly one.”",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim apologised to their fans for a “disastrous” season – then promised them “good days are coming”. Amorim said: “I want to apologise for this season. I know you are really disappointed with me and with the team.",
      "“Now we have to make a choice. We fight each other or we stick together and move forward. After this disastrous season, I want to tell you the good days are coming.”"

      "It marks United's worst-ever Premier League season and the 13-times champions will not be able to rely on the financial boost that comes with qualifying for Europe. Amorim's side missed out on qualification for the Champions League after losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",

      "Unai Emery's side knew they needed to win at Old Trafford and hope results elsewhere went their way. They were down to ten men come half-time, but Morgan Rogers looked to have landed the game's first goal when he seized on a goalkeeping error.",
      "Altay Bayindir struggled to regather the ball and Rogers was able to nip in before converting into an empty net, but the referee felt that the United goalkeeper was unfairly dispossessed and blew before the ball crossed the line.",

      "Although there is a post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong to navigate over the next week, the domestic season could not have ended quickly enough for United. Progression in the Europa League made the season salvageable but United lost to the worst Tottenham team since they were last relegated.",
      "Here are how the United players rated in 2024-25:",
      "Andre Onana",
      "It is easy to forget how secure Onana was in the first three months. That changed after Arsenal cornered him and he committed too many clangers, with the nadir away to Lyon. 4",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Played ten times and was the hero of the FA Cup triumph at Arsenal but he was almost always unconvincing, including in the only Premier League match United won with him in net against Aston Villa. 4",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Started to make some headway in March and early April but his form before then was nondescript. United missed him when he was injured but they need a new right winger. 4",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "One of United's most consistent performers. Mazraoui missed one game through illness and played in seven different roles. He is lacking in attack but is a valuable squad player in defence and provided value for money. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "On an individual basis, possibly his best campaign with United. Maguire scored huge goals, was more often than not solid defensively and has become a captain without the armband. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Struggled in his first six months but found form in March before he sustained injury at Nottingham Forest at the start of April, which effectively ended his season prematurely. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did not debut until December after he recovered from a metatarsal fracture but Yoro grew in confidence during the run-in and is an established starter in the back three. An encouraging first year. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Had a sloppy first half of the season but found form in January with some big goals and big moments. Then his season was over in February due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. 5",
      "Victor Lindelof",
      "Started 12 games in his least-involved season. Outstayed his welcome after United ill-advisedly triggered the one-year extension in his contract and United have paid millions to service Lindelof. 3",
      "Jonny Evans",
      "Barely qualifies as he started six games and made one substitute appearance in the final five months of the campaign. Was excellent in the goalless draw with Aston Villa. 4",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Amorim turned to him in the final month and that faith was misguided. Shaw missed seven months of football and was shoddy in the Europa League final. 3",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "The mid-season arrival had an enterprising few weeks in March and April but he suffered from Dalot's injury and failed to have any impact in United's remaining matches, despite starting regularly. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Had a handful of decent games and scored a couple of good goals but, for a 24-year-old, he has seldom looked ready to anchor United's midfield. His form was so poor in recent weeks he was benched for the Europa League final. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Went from redundant to relevant in the Europa League knockout stage, when he was totemic. That skews the perception of Casemiro, who had a forgettable domestic term. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Another injury-prone season was almost salvaged with a few goals and a start in the Europa League final. Then Mount reminded everyone in Bilbao why he and United have always looked a mismatch. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Lost his starting place a long time ago. He will always have the Lyon equaliser from his second full campaign but this has been one to forget for a player whose future is uncertain. 4",
      "Christian Eriksen",
      "Started 19 games in a season that was destined to be his last at United. Eriksen scored five goals but his only one in the league was the final-day penalty against Villa. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "The turning point for Fernandes was his red card at Wolves on Boxing Day. Before then, he looked like another United player who had eased up after signing a new contract. In 2025, he has been such a driving force that comparisons with Bryan Robson are legitimate. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Might have been United's player of the season but for his two-and-a-half-month lay-off between February and May. Tallied 11 goals and came up with memorable moments against Manchester City and Southampton. 8",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Has become a borderline cult hero since his 33rd-minute withdrawal against Newcastle. Zirkzee rallied in 2025 and produced good performances in a more withdrawn role. But he is not a striker. 5",
      "Alejandro Garnacho",
      "Not got anywhere near the highs of 2023-24 in a season of personal lows. Garnacho has done decently for a 20-year-old adapting to a new system but he has often been juvenile and crossed his head coach one too many times. 6",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "After his matchwinning goals in Plzen on December 12, Hojlund scraped three goals in 35 matches. Hojlund scored 10 goals and only four of them were in the Premier League. Drained of confidence and not good enough. 3",
      "Players must have started at least five games to be eligible for a rating. Loanees are excluded."

      "\"If you start now you can have a pre-season and that season will be the first season. I have to deliver next year. I am really confident we are going to play better and get more results. It will take time. We will suffer again but we need to have better results, that’s for sure",
      "\"I am really excited to finish the season. I am really excited to start again. We cannot lose any time. We need to prepare the pre-season. In the next years we will have World Cup, so will not have time to take advantage of that. We will have some changes in our squad.\"",

      "He contributed just 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances for United and he was loaned to Real Betis in the January transfer window, which has given him a new lease of life.",

      "Speaking ahead of that game, Antony discussed his time in Manchester and broke down in tears in an emotional interview.",
      "\"As I said, I wanted to do things, but they didn't seem to work out because I wasn't happy, I didn't feel that desire to play football, and I needed to find myself and be happy again because playing football was always something I loved.",

      "\"To attribute Antony's lack of success at Manchester United solely to the question of physicality is a very superficial argument and does not reflect reality.",
      "\"The truth is that Antony has not had enough prominence or the confidence necessary to play his best football. Of the 15 games in which Amorim managed Manchester United, he only used Antony in nine, with a total of 252 minutes played. This represents only 18.6% of the total possible minutes (1,350 minutes). How can you judge an athlete without a minimum sequence to prove his worth?",
      "\"The manager's statement, although perhaps it was not his intention, ends up devaluing La Liga and the Spanish competitions. Spanish football has one of the most competitive leagues in the world, with top-level teams that constantly compete in the final stages of the Champions League and the Europa League.",
      "\"The reality is that Antony, since he arrived at Real Betis, has become one of the best players in the team and in the competition itself, demonstrating his full potential when given the right conditions to develop his game. This highlights that the problem was not the physicality, but the context and the way he was managed in Manchester.",

I've loved the pressure, loved the style of play with the different managers and the people at the club.",
      "“I mean, they’ve taken really good care of me and my family, so in that sense I’ve had three very, very good years. Obviously it’s been a lot of ups and downs in football, but I think in general I’ve had a special time.”",
      "About his future, he added: \"First of all there’s a bit of a holiday and national team. Then after they we’ll see where next season starts, but at the moment there’s nothing (lined up). There’s options.”",
      "Eriksen ended his time at United with a victory in front of a home crowd. “Yeah, I think it was the best way possible, taking into account, like you said, the season behind us and looking ahead,\" he said about the team's performance against Villa.",
      "“I think it was the perfect ending, of course, a bad season. But to see people with a smile on their face and you go home and have a good feeling in the stadium, I think that's hopefully something we'll bring into next season and start well.”",
      "Eriksen also thanked United fans for their unwavering support throughout a difficult campaign. “There’s been so many games this season where they [supporters] could have caused a lot of chaos where we’ve been disappointed with our football,\" he said.",
      "\"But obviously the fans, I think to our surprise really, have supported us. Obviously, at home has been, even in the stadium, there’s been games where it’s been not good enough, but they’ve really been supportive and away especially they’ve been even more on their toes and even in the worst times.",
      "“The club is happy to have those supporters who really support the players and the club no matter what.”"

      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has enjoyed a successful season following his move from Old Trafford to Marseille.",
      "The 23-year-old completed a move to the French club last summer, and has earned praise for his performances in Ligue 1. In his first season he has scored 22 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions, and helped the club to a second place finish in the league behind Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Greenwood made a big impact in the final weeks of the campaign with three goals and as assist in the last two games, including a brace in the season finale against Rennes, as Marseille ran out as 4-2 winners.",
      "However, there has been some speculation over his future. Some reports suggest that there has been some tension between the player and manager Roberto De Zerbi, with doubts arising over Greenwood’s long-term future at the club.",
      "Any move away would see United receive 50 percent of any profit from Greenwood's sale. Clubs in Saudi Arabia have been linked with the attacker, while suggestions he is bound for the exit door have been played down by Marseille president Pablo Longoria.",
      "Longoria also revealed that United are due an additional fee for Greenwood this summer. He said: \"Regarding the contract situation, we bought 50% of the player's value; it was the only way to complete the transaction because they had offers higher than ours.",
      "\"Qualifying for the Champions League requires us to buy around 10% more.\"",
      "Marseille have now celebrated what has been an impressive first season for Greenwood at the club. On their official Instagram channel, they have shared a montage of the player’s goals.",
      "They have then added a caption that translates to: “Starboy. Marseille’s top scorer and Om attack dynamite, back to Mason Greenwood’s first Olympic season.”",
      "Following the final game of the season last week, Greenwood reflected on 2024/25 with a social media post of his own. “From day one, this club welcomed me like family,” he said.",
      "“Ending the season in 2nd and qualifying for the Champions League is something we can all be proud of. Being joint top scorer in Ligue 1 is a proud moment for me personally, but the real highlight was playing in front of our incredible fans week in, week out. Your support means the world.”",
      "The post was ‘liked’ by a number of his former United teammates including Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot."

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has weighed in on the controversial decision by Thomas Bramall to rule out Morgan Rogers' goal against Manchester United.",
      "Rogers thought he had scored in the 74th minute at Old Trafford, capitalising on an error from United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. But the referee blew for a foul by Rogers on Bayindir just before the ball reached the empty net.",
      "As referee Bramall had already stopped play before the ball crossed the line, VAR was powerless to reverse the decision, even though replays suggested that it may have been the wrong call.",
      "United beat Villa 2-0 courtesy of second-half goals from Amad and Christian Eriksen, with the visitors missing out on Champions League qualification as a result.",
      "\"He's got the ball there under control, I think he loses it there and the damage is done here for me because once the referee blows his whistle the game is terminated, so Rogers' shot at that point doesn't count.",
      "\"I just wonder, we talk all the time about players creating time on the ball, if the referee creates one second I think the landscape moves and the VAR can intervene. And I wonder then if the VAR intervenes he can then go to the screen and they change his decision, he may stick with it.",
      "\"If he changes his decision I think a lot of people would be happy with it and accept it. Even if he sticks with it, I think we will have a situation where it is more palatable. People will not like it, but they will accept it more, but because of what happens it is very, very untidy.",
      "\"The VAR checks when the whistle was blown, not the goal. That's the key issue. If he had waited the time is still his own, he owns that time and he can make as many decisions as he wants. He can ask his assistants. Then he can ask VAR. He may have said it's a foul which we would have accepted. He just didn't give himself time to think – that's his only mistake.\"",
      "When asked if he believes it should have been a goal, Gallagher added: \"I think as it develops I will explain more to you how I think, it's not as easy as that. I think the referee has probably taken the worst option for himself at the moment.\"",
      "Villa confirmed on Sunday night they have written to PGMOL about the decision, questioning the appointment of the inexperienced Bramall to such a high-stakes match.",
      "Villa's director of football, Damian Vidagany, confirmed an official complaint would be made. “The complaint is not about the decision. The complaint is about the selection of the referees,\" he said.",
      "\"One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams. It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake.",
      "\"The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.”",
      "On Emi Martinez's sending off after a clash with United striker Rasmus Hojlund due to Matty Cash's sloppy back pass, Gallagher added: \"The goalkeeper makes no attempt to play the ball. Red card.\""

      "Fans would rather watch academy prospects give their all against Aston Villa than players who have been responsible for this season, and it will be the only interesting aspect of the game.",

      "Is there much for Amorim to add after a bleak campaign? He's probably said it all in press conferences and interviews, and might feel it's best to avoid a speech on Sunday.",

Avram Glazer sat alongside Sir Jim Ratcliffe to watch the Europa League final in Bilbao on Wednesday and removing the American family remains the target for fan groups.",

      "After this loss, it was unclear whether Amorim would be addressing the supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford but, in an interview with MUTV, the Portuguese head coach confirmed his plans.",
      "\"I would say, Sunday, I will have the opportunity to speak to them after the game,\" he explained following the loss in Bilbao. \"It's tradition in our club.",
      "\"It's hard to speak to the fans in this moment. So we have one more game in our home and we want to finish in a good way.",
      "\"Then I will have the opportunity to speak to our fans.\"",
      "Despite all of the bad feeling around the club, the supporters have remained fully on board with Amorim as he aims to change the club's fortunes.",
      "In terms of his team selection, Amorim had not picked Alejandro Garnacho in his squad after informing the forward he can leave if an acceptable offer is received. Goalkeeper Andre Onana has also been left out with Altay Bayindir starting."

      "The Premier League season is over and that can mean only one thing: going back to our pre-season predictions and laughing our heads clean off at the hilariously confident wrongness contained within.",
      "Mocking our ridiculous and frequent inaccuracies in this fashion makes us realise why you lot enjoy it so much in the comments.",
      "Anyway. Let’s crack on. Upcoming highlights include ‘Liverpool will struggle’, Ipswich to stay up ‘comfortably’, Forest to get relegated and Nuno to be the first manager out of a job. Yeah, it’s a vintage year all right – you can read the whole sorry thing in full here.",
      "Let’s get into it.",
      "",
      "As is traditional, tell me who will win the league.\nA large and at the time pretty understandable consensus for a Man City five-peat here, with plenty of chat about them doing it easily. ‘I think the gap will be bigger’ said big boss Sarah Winterburn; ’12 points to spare’ chirped Dave Tickner.",
      "There were Arsenal shouts from Matt Stead and Jason Soutar, and absolutely no Liverpool talk whatsoever. No shame in that at the time, really – the Liverpool-based shame arrives with the next question…",
      "",
      "And the rest of the top four, in order. Which nobody ever gets right.\nIn keeping with tradition, absolutely nobody got this right. But boy did some get it wrong.",
      "The points in this round go to John Nicholson for at least managing to Eric Morecambe his way to the right four clubs, if not necessarily in the right order, following up his City title prediction with: ‘Arsenal, a long way behind. Chelsea, despite being a joke. Liverpool, despite losing a manager.’",
      "Tickner and Jason Soutar got all their four into the Champions League at least having named Newcastle among their picks and – crucially – not left out Liverpool. Bonus points here for Soutar also saying Villa wouldn’t be as good and that Spurs would prioritise cup competitions. And how.",
      "Who did leave out Liverpool? Pelt Ian Watson with rotten fruit for not only having Liverpool outside his top four but Manchester United inside it, pre-empting his own fate by following that shout with ‘Why do I do it?’ Good question, Watto. A very good question.",
      "The standout answer here, and perhaps ever, surely belongs to Will Ford for his deeply prophetic ‘Liverpool will struggle’, a line destined for infamy and only partially redeemed by the immediately following ‘Man Utd will be worse’. Tottenham in third also didn’t quite pan out.",
      "Dishonourable mentions too for Winterburn for having United in there, and Stead for having Tottenham.",
      "Lewis Oldham also went for Tottenham, while saying ‘Arne Slot-ball will bring Liverpool closer to Arsenal’ which was so right it ended up being wrong but then adding that Arsenal would win a trophy, which was so wrong it remained wrong.",
      "",
      "Three picks for relegation please.\nObvious answer is obvious, but plenty eschewed that obviousness so give Winterburn, Stead and a partially redeemed Ford their flowers for refusing to make this more complicated than it needed to be. ‘Sometimes you can try and be too clever’ were Winty’s words of wisdom when selecting the three who’d come up to go back down, and that was advice almost all of her charges went on to cheerfully ignore.",
      "A genuinely hilarious number of those too-clever idiots opted for Forest here, with Tickner, Watson and Oldham all stumbling into that particular trap along with Nicholson who declared ‘Predictability rules again’ as he did so. This season really has been a mad one.",
      "Still, even those who got it hilariously wrong did all manage to send at least two of the promoted clubs straight back down, and Soutar is surely grateful for the even wronger answers elsewhere that allow his punt on Brentford to slip by almost unnoticed.",
      "",
      "Which club will be a pleasant surprise?\nThe age-old problem with this question is not just identifying things that are surprises but also things that are pleasant.",
      "Winty’s shout for Everton to be ‘serenely… in mid-table’ turned out right in the end and the Moyes return just about ticks the pleasant box, we’d suggest.",
      "Stead does well here:",
      "Chelsea will do well, but while that will surprise some it will not be in any way pleasant. If Brentford can avoid half their squad being unavailable this time they should get back to their nose-bloodying best.",
      "Ford continues his redemption arc from the Liverpool unpleasantness by suggesting ‘Bournemouth will be in the mix for Europe before Andoni Iraola has his head turned by one of the big boys.’ Iraola may not have left, but only time will tell if there was nevertheless some head-turning involved in the way they fell off in spring.",
      "Tickner starts off okay with a Palace 50-point shout but then goes all kinds of wrong by mentioning West Ham. Although with his Spurs proclivities perhaps West Ham being sh*tbone awful was his idea of a pleasant surprise. Who knows what he’s thinking half the time, honestly.",
      "‘No alarms, no surprises. Everything will be as you imagine,’ said Nicholson, who knew even then that Man United and Spurs were heading for the bottom six.",
      "A couple of Ipswich shouts from Watson and Oldham here, with Lewis declaring the Tractor Boys would be ‘cushty between 11th and 14th’. The highest position in which they ended any matchday this season was 15th after six games. ‘Everton will be in a similar spot as they enjoy a decent final year at Goodison’ is much more like it, with the Toffees 13th when the music stopped.",

      "",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot?\nAll the credit in the world here to Soutar. In a world of ‘Haaland, next’ always be the man brave enough to say ‘Mo Salah, actually’.",
      "Delivers that truthbomb in mic-drop style as well:",
      "Erling Haaland…will not. It’s going to be Mohamed Salah.",
      "Stunning.",
      "Partial credit to Tickner for identifying Alexander Isak as ‘each-way value’ behind Erling Haaland, with Oldham also giving Newcastle’s star man the shout.",
      "",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact?\nThe correct answer here was surely Nikola Milenkovic at Forest and if it’s not him then it may well in fact be Elliot Anderson also at Forest.",
      "Anyway. Nobody said those.",
      "Winterburn and Watson were both charmed by Niclas Fullkrug. Winty reckoned he would ‘buck the West Ham striker trend’ while Watson noted ‘West Ham with an actual striker should be useful’. He scored three Premier League goals. West Ham were not useful.",
      "Nicholson went for Matthijs De Ligt, which definitely isn’t the right answer and nor was Emile Smith Rowe (Ford), Riccardo Calafiori (Tickner) or Fabio Carvalho (Oldham).",
      "‘Amario Cozier-Duberry could shine if given adequate minutes by Brighton,’ piped up Soutar. Is 713 minutes for Blackburn adequate, we wonder.",
      "",
      "And which one will turn out to be a massive flop?\nLots of Matthijs de Ligt here and that’s probably just about fair enough. Also lots of Dominic Solanke, which is a trickier one.",
      "We’re particular fascinated here by Johnny Nic’s contribution here:",
      "Solanke’s nine goals will prove what we all suspect.",
      "Solanke duly scored precisely nine Premier League goals for Spurs. Yet we feel we’re absolutely none the wiser about him in general, and he was vital in the latter stages of that Europa League run. Perhaps it really is just as straightforward as noting that trying to understand Spurs is fundamentally impossible.",
      "Further proof of that in Tickner’s answer where Solanke’s unpredictability was tied to that of a Spurs team that could ‘finish third or ninth’ because the idea of ninth representing a peak Tottenham banter effort now just looks utterly adorable, doesn’t it?",
      "Easier wins come in this round for Ford and Oldham as they pick out Joshua Zirkzee, while Watto’s pick of another nine-goal striker in Iliman Ndiaye at Everton feels neither profoundly right nor embarrassingly wrong.",
      "",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain?\nNobody picked him out in the best signing category, but big points to Stead for selecting Milenkovic here.",
      "We’re assuming neither Winterburn nor Soutar were banking on Daichi Kamada having more Premier League red cards (1) than goal involvements (0), while another shout for Carvalho – Nicholson this time – has to go down as a swing and a miss.",
      "Oldham and Tickner’s admirable and noble attempts to manifest Ryan Sessegnon success kind of almost came off in the second half of the season, while Dave was also pretty much bang on with a very safe shout about £8m for Lucas Bergvall looking ‘stupidly cheap stupidly quickly’.",
      "Ford also right about £21m for Savinho, and also about why they were able to get him for £21m. Watto played the long game with Archie Gray and is almost certainly going to get the last laugh there even at £35m.",
      "",
      "Who will be named the PFA Player of the Year?\nStill technically TBC but absolutely nobody is getting this right because absolutely nobody said Mo Salah.",
      "There’s all manner of different flavour of wrong in here. You’re always a hostage to injury fortune here, of course, and that took out Winterburn (Rodri) and Stead (Saka) early doors.",
      "Interesting that this question prompted different – and wrong, cannot stress that enough – answers from all eight of our intrepid soothsayers, with De Ligt and Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice and Kevin De Bruyne and Cole Palmer all getting nods.",
      "In a grim round for all it’s probably Tickner who emerges with what tiny fragments of credit there are to be had for saying Isak. It’s still wrong, but it definitely feels the least wrong.",
      "",
      "First manager to leave their Premier League job?\nFrom least wrong to most wrong for Tickner here as he goes for Nottingham Forest hero Nuno Espirito Santo. Whoops.",
      "He is at least not alone in his shame, with Winterburn and Oldham making the same mistake.",
      "Steady’s Marco Silva punt isn’t much better, really, and nor is Soutar’s rush to judgement on Fabian Hurzeler at Brighton.",
      "Russell Martin (Nicholson) and Steve Cooper (Watson) are much better shouts because they at least didn’t make it to the new year. But they were pipped to the sack race crown by Erik Ten Hag, as correctly and in hindsight really bloody obviously called by Ford. He really would have done quite well here if it hadn’t been for that immortal ‘Liverpool will struggle’ effort.",
      "",
      "Pick the Champions League winner.\nSix shouts for Real Madrid and one for Bayern Munich after sacking Vincent Kompany means the only person even halfway in the running for any credit at all here is Ford again, who had PSG to beat Real Madrid in the final. If only he hadn’t got cocky by giving us the runner-up as well, he’d now be sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "In five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season.\nWinterburn was undeniably right – up to you whether it’s in the way she intended or not – with ‘Liverpool under anybody but Klopp’, while the wait goes on for Watson (‘Man City before a judge’) and Ford (‘One hundred and fifteen charges’).",
      "Tickner bloody loves format discourse and in fairness couldn’t possibly have known that ‘Sh*t Champions League format discourse’ would ultimately be overtaken by ‘Should Europa League winners really get a Champions League place if they are actually very sh*t discourse’.",
      "But that’s more than five words, anyway.",
      "",
      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "The Saudi Pro League will be back with a bang in the summer transfer window and Arsenal, Liverpool and Bruno Fernandes could be impacted.",
      "Only that iconic Liverpool front three have scored more Premier League goals against the Big Six than Luis Diaz, which feels quite mad.",
      "According to reports, Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis ‘erupted’ in a second clash with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo at the weekend.",
      "‘Scandalous from that Forest owner,’ said Gary Neville, but both owner and manager have downplayed the dressing-down.",
      "Will Mikel Arteta’s headloss remotivate Liverpool as Arsenal bid to end a troubling week by making some kind of point on yet another Big Weekend?"

      "Here are this season’s disgraces, and boy is there a lot of them.",
      "If you’re after something a bit more cheerful, the winners list is also available here.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nAnd we thought finishing 8th and winning the FA Cup last season was bad. Not sure if you’ve heard but this was their worst season in 50 years.",
      "The most remarkable thing about Manchester United at this point is just what a black hole for talent it is.  Players and managers can look very very good when they make the move, only for what was once Theatre of Dreams to become the place where careers go to sleep.",
      "Although there were some question marks, United’s summer recruitment looked good to most of us, yet they have collectively spent the whole season going backwards. The squad is full of players who made bright starts, but then got flattened out to the same level as everyone else.",
      "Remember when Kobbie Mainoo looked amazing? It was only last year. Remember being excited by Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho?",
      "Several players who have also apparently been deemed to be a big part of the problem at Old Trafford have left – whether by their own volition or because they have been exiled – and turned out to still be excellent: Antony, Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay made our winners list for exactly that reason.",
      "Erik ten Hag still being in charge at the start of the season was also questionable, but he was replaced by one of European football’s hot young things in Ruben Amorim and things got worse, suggesting the Dutchman was not, in fact, the whole problem all along.",
      "United have thus become the kind of club whose precise issues are very difficult to pinpoint from the outside, other than to note there are lots of them.",
      "You could point at Liverpool two years ago and say ‘they need a new midfield’. You can point at Arsenal now and say ‘they need more quality in the final third’. For Tottenham, ‘they need more experience in the side’. For Manchester City, the opposite. Try to point at the issues at Manchester United, and you’ll run out of fingers.",
      "We’ve watched a lot of League One this season, and on more than one occasion have seen sides who just don’t look like they would score if they played until midnight. When that has happened, we find ourselves thinking ‘god, this is like watching Manchester United’ – and we’re genuinely not even trying to amuse ourselves with the comparison.",
      "This year there was no trophy at the end of it to act as any mitigation, and their showing in the Europa League final was pretty representative of how they’ve been. Throwing Harry Maguire up front to look for a goal may have worked in spectacular fashion to get them there in the first place, but it is not a strategy any serious club should be reliant on. But that’s what will happen when you have a side that looks so confused, so lacking in confidence and creativity.",
      "Even for those of us who grew up with the envious antipathy towards United that is afforded to all the best sides, it’s managed to go out the other side of being funny and is now actually quite sad.",
      "United are currently English football’s cautionary tale about how low a club can be brought if their priorities slip away into all the wrong place over time, regardless how big and rich they may be. It says a lot that even now, Amorim’s prospects are being questioned, rather than his head being stuck on a pike.",
      "It’s bad. They’re bad. And it feels like nothing other than a wholesale revolution in the way they do things is going to be enough to get them back on course.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana\nLong before you found yourself without spare fingers, though, you’d be extending one towards one player. Even within that absolute horror show, the goalkeeper has stood out as a particular liability. As spectacular as he can be at times, he’s just way too error-prone to be regarded as a top goalkeeper.",
      "Unfortunately for United, Altay Bayindir looks to be pretty much exactly the same – which we presume is the only reason Onana has been dropped and then restored and then dropped and then restored. But United can find better, and need to in the summer.",
      "",
      "Manchester City and Pep Guardiola\nYes, they’re in the losers list despite completing the famously mammoth task of winning the Community Shield. Sorry, Pep.",
      "Has death by rondo had its day? Are we now back in an age of swift, incisive, direct counter-attacking football? It’s too early to write that obituary just yet, especially after City got their act together sufficiently enough to finish third. But this season nonetheless marked the first time that Guardiola’s style has come in for really serious scrutiny beyond the aesthetic.",
      "The issues that contributed to City’s decline in the first two-thirds of the season had not gone unremarked upon beforehand. Erling Haaland looked mortal at times last season, too, while players like Kyle Walker and Kevin de Bruyne were self-evidently past their best.",
      "Still, nobody expected just how bad it was going to get. At one point in November-December, City managed one win and six points from 11 games across the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "For the time being, we’re fairly content to say this could prove to be a difficult and disappointing transitional year for City, and it could have been a lot worse than finishing third despite all those issues.",
      "But even after rallying in January, thanks in part to some big spending in the transfer window, City were hammered by Arsenal and Real Madrid, beaten at home by Liverpool, lost what could have ended up being a crucial six-pointer against Nottingham Forest, dropped points to Manchester United and Southampton, and lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace.",
      "That suggests there is still more work to be done to get back to business as normal for a club that has a genuine and well-founded expectation that they’re capable of winning everything in sight.",
      "",
      "Phil Foden and, for completely opposite reasons, Jack Grealish\nWe have sympathy for both. Poor Foden spoke this week about simply being physically and mentally burnt out, to which the only appropriate response is ‘yeah, no s*** Phil, you bloody look it and all’.",
      "Over the past five years, Foden has played 286 competitive games of football for club and country, starting most of them; that’s an average of 57.2 a year, and for a side that has built its success on relentless pressure and intensity.",
      "Genuinely, it’s impressive that it took this long for Foden to have an off season. We say this without any shade intended towards the Chelsea man, but Cole Palmer took less than half as long for it to catch up to him.",
      "It does raise an interesting talking point, and before you write in, we’re not specifically ragging on Guardiola alone here: he’s far, far from the only manager to do this kind of thing.",
      "But while we agree with complaints from the likes of Guardiola about fixture congestion and the demands simply being too much, we can never quite understand why more managers don’t recognise that they have the ability to give their players a month off as and when they need it for their own longer-term good.",
      "All the while, there sits Jack Grealish, desperate to play and supremely talented, but largely left to twiddle his thumbs. You could say that when he’s played he’s not been amazing, but since the turn of the new year he’s had all of 144 Premier League minutes across seven appearances. 90 of them were against Leicester, and he scored in that game.",
      "And yet Guardiola actually wants a smaller squad next season, saying he would quit if he had such a large squad again next season because trying to manage so many players is borderline impossible. Our trophy cabinet is far smaller than Guardiola’s (Cub Scout of the Year 1997/98, you’ll never sing that), but…doesn’t it feel obvious that Foden and Grealish have entirely opposite and complementary problems that can both be solved at once?",
      "Like we say, it’s not just Guardiola by any means – we’re just using this as an example. And yes, FIFA, UEFA and the federations have a responsibility. But surely clubs and managers do too?",
      "",
      "Arsenal and Mikel Arteta\nThey have to go in losers, we’re afraid, because Arsenal were more or less the default prediction for who was going to win the league this year, and quite justifiably so.",
      "The Gunners had pushed a very very good Manchester City side close over the past two seasons, and had a side that were just coming of age as City’s was beginning to look in need of a refresh. Yet all that optimism turned out to be misplaced.",
      "For our money, Arsenal fell way short of Liverpool this season for two main reasons. In the first half of the season, their lack of discipline was appalling – and by that we don’t mean they had too many bookings and red cards, which was merely a symptom of a wider issue.",
      "What we mean is that they were much too quick to lose their heads, whether that was because of refereeing decisions they didn’t like (regardless how correct they actually may have been) or because of the scoreboard.",
      "To Arteta’s credit, he seemed to manage to sort that out…only to run into problem number two.",
      "We’ve never quite gone all the way along with the ‘they need a striker’ thing, in truth. Arsenal scored 88 and 91 goals respectively in the past two seasons, despite their centre-forward options not being deemed to be up to snuff. Liverpool won the league this season with Diogo Jota, Darwin Nunez, and an out-of-position Luis Diaz as their main striking options. Other players are allowed to score goals as well, lads.",
      "Where Arsenal have suffered is in a lack of depth in the forward line as a whole. That already felt like an issue even before injuries to Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz exposed it even further. The likes of Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli are good, but feel more like they should be squad options than starters.",
      "We happily accept that if Mohamed Salah had gone down with a knee injury in October, Liverpool would have suffered in similar fashion – but not quite as badly. Diaz and Cody Gakpo both broke double figures for goals in the league this season; not a single Arsenal player managed it.",
      "",
      "Raheem Sterling and, for similar reasons, Jaden Sancho\nWe are absolutely shocked that Sterling did not turn out to be the solution to that problem for Arsenal. Shocked.",
      "We feel bad for Sterling. As we’ve expressed before, it feels a bit unfair that two different players could each have ten good years in their careers, yet if they have it at the start of their careers they get slated for their decline, whereas if they have them at the end of their careers, they get no stick for having been rubbish before and all the praise for their improvement.",
      "We shouldn’t forget that Sterling was an excellent player for a long time. The problem is that does feel quite firmly past tense now, and he may have to swallow a bit of pride as he weighs up his next move. We doubt another club of Arsenal’s profile will come knocking again this summer.",
      "And while we’re on wingers whose best years look to be behind them…Jadon Sancho was genuinely great for Borussia Dortmund and England a few years ago. Like, he’s not a Francis Jeffers or something, who was just over-hyped out of proportion and was never actually going to get to a top level. He started at a top level.",
      "If he’d been at Chelsea in either of the past two seasons, we could probably write it off as just being another bad career move. But Chelsea have actually been pretty good in spells; Sancho hasn’t. It’s a shame.",
      "",
      "Julen Lopetegui and West Ham\nThe Hammers deciding it was time to move on from David Moyes was harsh, but understandable.",
      "While evidently grateful to the Scot for delivering the Conference League trophy and overseeing a considerable improvement on getting drawn into relegation battles, they want to move on to someone with the ability to push them to the next level. Absolutely fine. We get it.",
      "What we don’t get is why they thought Julen Lopetegui would be that man. Does he just interview incredibly well or something? From Spain to Real Madrid to Wolves, we just don’t see what the enduring fascination is with him.",
      "Not that things have really got much better under Graham Potter, mind, that victory away to Arsenal aside. As with Amorim, it’s hard to judge any mid-season managerial appointment – though Moyes and Vitor Pereira did make our winners list – and we’re interested to see what West Ham have for us next season. Our hunch is they will be quite a bit better.",
      "Still, it must be unbelievably frustrating to be a West Ham fan. Never a step forward without a big step back to follow.",
      "",
      "Newly-promoted clubs, just in general\nThere’s always been a gap between the Premier League and the Championship, but all our number-crunching a few years ago suggested that despite claims to the contrary, that gap had not really grown for about 25 years.",
      "It was there in the numbers. Sides going down to the second tier were no more likely to bounce straight back up than they’d ever been, and sides coming up to the top flight were no more likely to go straight back down than they’d ever been. The complaints about the growing gap in quality was, at that point, the kind of vague ‘sort of feels like it though doesn’t it’ claim that we’re all prone to after a pint.",
      "That’s changed completely since the last massive increase in TV money. The distance between the Premier League and the Championship is an absolute gulf.",
      "It’s not that the second tier has got worse, either. I’ve seen more Championship football over the past 16 years than any other level of football, and can tell you the standard has risen if anything. One colleague told me in a press room this season that he had been watching old mid-table Premier League games from 2005 as research for a piece, and that it looked exactly like the Championship does now.",
      "The standard in the Premier League, as an average across the division, is just now so unbelievably high, because even a pretty mediocre side can go out and outspend all but the biggest behemoths in European football for transfer fees and wages. We got something like confirmation of that in the Europa League: Manchester United and Tottenham both reached the final – and deservedly so – despite being absolute crap in the Premier League, finishing 15th and 17th.",
      "That should be a good thing, but it is desperately hurting the case of any newly-promoted sides, for whom the only reasonable expectation now is that they will go straight back down to the Championship…where the expectation now (admittedly not fulfilled this season, especially not by League One-bound Luton) is that they will go straight back up.",
      "The Premier League has always been depressingly myopic and uncaring about this kind of thing, because they sit separate from the rest of the pyramid and almost exclusively vote in ways that assume that they will be Premier League clubs forever and never ever get relegated.",
      "If that was short-sighted and self-defeating before, it’s now actually becoming the case – and is only likely to get worse. Premier League votes generally only need 16 out of 20 clubs to vote for them. In the current state of affairs, 17 of those clubs actually are more or less entrenched in the top flight unless they right royally screw it up in massive, massive fashion. Good for those clubs. Terrible for everyone else, including the neutral fan.",
      "We need some jeopardy back, and honestly don’t think five up, five down would be a bad idea at this point. It might at the very least get the Premier League clubs thinking about what life is like in the second tier and why narrowing the gap again would be to everybody’s benefit.",
      "",
      "Special mention to Southampton for being especially crap\nDreadful. We’re going to miss saying ‘except against Southampton, which doesn’t count’ every single time we’re talking about another side in a dreadful run of form with one speck of green in it.",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur, who are also in the winners list\nAnd this is why we need that jeopardy back.",
      "There’s an argument that like United, Spurs were so focused on the Europa League towards the end of the season that their league form was basically an inconvenient irrelevance to them. Even if it’s subconscious…who cares if you constantly lose when you already know you can’t get relegated even while finishing with a paltry 38 points?",
      "Well…the fans do, for one, and they were not shy about making their feelings clear.",
      "Tottenham produced lovely stuff at times – for much of the season, Liverpool were the only side to outscore them – but they were callow, callow, callow. Who’d have thought that’s what you’d get from not just centring your recruitment policy around youth, but making it more or less the only criterion?",
      "That excuse only goes so far, though; Chelsea and Brighton both had younger sides on average than Tottenham this season, and they did alright in the end.",
      "While the fans have concentrated their ire mostly on Daniel Levy, the neutral’s glare has generally fallen on Ange Postecoglou and his at times stubborn insistence on ignoring some simple pragmatic steps to improve his side’s form in favour of pursuing a style of play that often feels too risky to be worthwhile.",
      "Chelsea had a similar problem for a while, but as we discussed in the winners, even Enzo Maresca made adaptations to address that, one-nilling their way through the closing stages of the season to secure their Champions League place.",
      "Spurs will be joining them there, of course. The Europa League trophy provided some vindication for Postecoglou, though it was amusing that their 1-0 victory in the final was almost a complete departure from what we had seen from Spurs all season. It was the third time they had won a game 1-0; the others were in their League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, and against Manchester United again in the league.",
      "We will say that despite all that…we still have a soft spot for Postecoglou and for Spurs, if only because it’s hard to dislike an amusingly chippy manager who sticks to his attacking guns so much. They are our early shout for being the most interesting side to watch next season, because it feels like they’re either going to be great or terrible with no in between.",
      "",
      "Sean Dyche\nMatt Stead and I had a complete difference of opinion about Dyche’s sacking. I felt it was a risk; yeah, they didn’t score, but wasn’t that because they were a bit crap, and so focusing on defending first and foremost was the only thing likely to keep their heads above water?",
      "No, said Steady. They’re better than Dyche gives them credit for and will do a lot better when they’re given a bit more freedom.",
      "Annoyingly, he was absolutely bang on, of course. By the end of his time at Goodison Park, Dyche was holding Everton back; the results they immediately got after Moyes’ return confirmed as much, as did the genuinely quite impressive attacking form they showed while actually improving their defensive record.",
      "We shouldn’t overlook the enormously difficult situation Dyche inherited, and there’s a case to be made that Everton may not have even been a Premier League club this season without him. But sometimes it’s just time to move on.",
      "",
      "Gary O’Neil\nOn much the same rationale as Dyche, albeit for totally different reasons. The general reporting from those closest to Wolves is that O’Neil, if anything, had too many ideas, and increasingly threw them at his squad as things kept getting worse for them until their brains scrambled.",
      "That is surely only part of it: O’Neil went on record in his final interview as manager to say he had ‘never had such a struggle to help a group cope with real basic stuff’.",
      "It’s less than 18 months ago that O’Neil was being reported as a potential candidate to replace Jurgen Klopp, but after Vitor Pereira went in and turned things around so comprehensively, he has a bit of a job on his hands now to restore his reputation.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez\nAn £85m squad option for the champions, and not a particularly convincing one at that. He’s got talent, there’s no doubt about that, but Liverpool have spent three years waiting for him to add some consistency as well. It seems unlikely he’ll get a fourth.",
      "",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and comes out well on top.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has confirmed that four players will be leaving the Emirates Stadium this summer after beating Southampton 2-1 on Sunday.",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola could not hide his frustrations when asked about Jack Grealish after his side’s win against Fulham on the final day.",
      "Pep Guardiola has revealed why he has left Jack Grealish out of his Manchester City squad for their final game of the 2024/25 campaign against Fulham.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why he’s decided to leave Andre Onana out of the squad for Sunday’s match against Aston Villa.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers performed this season; they must have started 15 top-flight games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +5.0\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton, and made just one excellent stop v Bournemouth. A clean sheet and three saves on the final day at Fulham helped him claim the unofficial best goalkeeper award.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) Alisson (Liverpool): +3.7\nRemarkably, he made nine saves v Brighton as a sloppy Liverpool lost 3-2. Alisson vs Giorgi Mamardashvili next season will be interesting.",
      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +3.2\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final. Almost kept a clean sheet at Liverpool on the final day but could do nothing about Mohamed Salah’s deflected shot.",
      "",
      "5) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 73.9% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, which resulted in a shared Golden Glove with David Raya. They can get one hand each.",
      "",
      "6) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham Hotspur): +2.4\nSpurs have faced the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "7) Kepa (Bournemouth): +2.0\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He was an excellent loan signing by the Cherries.",
      "",
      "8) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea. Couldn’t do anything to stop the attempts to bottle top five.",
      "",
      "9) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.7\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League (76.4%) but still gets pelters from pundits. A clean sheet on the final day at Nottingham Forest got Chelsea in to the Champions League.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever and decided he wanted a piece of that action.",
      "",
      "11) David Raya (Arsenal): +1.2\nHe was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Glove. Both goalkeepers conceded on the final day and shared the award with 13.",
      "",
      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final. Had nothing to do with Altay Bayindir being involved in one of the most controversial moments of the season.",
      "",
      "13) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.8\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it mattered most were supposed to have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine, but then Manchester United away happened.",
      "",
      "14) Mark Flekken (Brentford): 0.0\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United. A nice round zero feels right.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Had the worst performance of the entire Premier League season.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -2.5\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton. No goalkeeper has conceded more goals from corners this season with 10.",
      "",
      "17) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -2.6\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "18) Jose Sa (Wolves): -3.0\nIncidentally has the same PSxG minus goals allowed as his back-up, Sam Johnstone.",
      "",
      "19) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -3.2\nA poor season compared to his usual standards. Only seven goalkeepers should actually have conceded fewer goals than Leno this season.",
      "",
      "20) Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): -5.0\nKept a first clean sheet since February in Brighton’s win over Wolves but it has still been a very shaky season for the Dutchman. Conceding seven at Nottingham Forest earned him a 3.95 WhoScored rating – the second-worst of the season behind Muric.",
      "Plus mentions for Tottenham, West Ham, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho, and a couple of managers whose sides instantly improved after they left",

      "The Cameroonian has retained his place in recent weeks but endured another difficult campaign at Old Trafford, marked by inconsistency and a series of costly errors, and is expect to stay put.",
      "However, Utd want fresh competition, and Joan Garcia is among the names under consideration. The Espanyol goalkeeper has emerged as a top-level performer in La Liga, finishing the season with a league-high 146 saves and drawing interest from several Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona have stepped up their interest in recent days, with Cadena SER claiming the 24-year-old has agreed personal terms with the Catalan giants. However, Fabrizio Romano reports that no deal has been reached with Espanyol, while also suggesting that ‘no decision has been made’ on Garcia’s part.",
      "Crucially, Barcelona would plan to sign Garcia and then loan him out for the 2025/26 campaign due to financial constraints.",

All the hot takes by bright-eyed young things who think they’ve discovered the motherlode of wisdom, you heard 55 years ago when Sam Leitch presented Football Focus and it was called Football Preview.",
      "I say this not to pretend to be a font of knowledge but to illustrate the folly of thinking anything is wholly original.",

This is doubly the case when they assume, wrongly, that you are a type that they’ve invented for themselves that they think defines your generation and that you must inevitably align.",
      "An example concerns Manchester United being relegated. Seen it, done it.",
      "I was 13 the last time Manchester United were relegated and though young Johnny had other pressing trouser-based concerns at that age, I remember how apocalyptic it was thought to be at the time. In fact the reality was it was all pretty painless. Next season they lost just seven games and won the second division easily by three points in front of Villa and Norwich; but what would happen now that they’re in even worse shape?",
      "The way Sky talk about relegation you’d think it was one of Dante’s seven circles of hell, at least until they want to show all their matches in next season.",
      "It’s all part of the ongoing project to establish the Premier League as an island of irresistible brilliance worth paying for.",
      "Fewer and fewer believe this, of course and they’ve had to play their last hand of cards of showing ever more games to try and shore up the creeping realisation that it’s just football and the fun doesn’t match the hyperbole and daily dance, no matter how many games they show. Imagine the hysteria which would accompany relegation this time? This is Manchester United we’re talking about, Kelly.",
      "Let’s say next season is a disaster too. It’s far from unlikely. Things are dire. Ruben Amorim is released from his waking nightmare at last  when he’s sacked in November and Malky Mackay is surprisingly appointed by Airhead Jim as an interim manager because he’s Scottish, cheap and swears like a Poundshop Sir Alex.",
      "His seasons at Ross County were thought to be a good grounding for the United role. But he’s obviously hopeless and they finish 19th on 26 points. What next?",
      "On the plus side relegation means they are now the big turd in a smaller bowl, financially dominant over everyone and at some point money must matter.",
      "We all know winning a lot, even in a lower division, is much more fun than losing a lot in a higher division. Obviously life is just better when you don’t play in the Premier League too.",
      "United get back to winning ways and storm the title. On top of that, they shed almost everyone on more than 50k a week, make a fortune selling off the failed ‘stars’ all of whom will be brilliant for someone else. They fill the squad with a mix of academy players and Championship grafters.",
      "The ridiculous bioform that is Scarecrow Jim finds out he hasn’t actually bought a biscuit business in Nice and leaves football in embarrassment, saying he is unable to associate his self-appointed undoubted brilliance with such failure. Similarly the Glazers decide second tier life is not for them and release the club from their icy death grip and let it be run by a fan’s trust. After a season out of the Premier League, they return refreshed and renewed, run on a different, less arrogant model.",
      "But on the other hand.",
      "It could all go wrong. The players are on long expensive contracts, no one will buy them and they won’t leave while they’re paid a million per month.",
      "Sponsors back out en masse, not wanting to stain their hard-earned noodle business’s reputation by being associated with a by-word for a poor brand.",
      "The academy has been denuded of funds over the years because the hollow-eyed ghoul just thought they’d buy talent in. Easy this football thing innit? And it is now rubbish and provides no new talent. Scarecrow Jim, anxious to prove he’s not actually a stupid, useless cu*t, stays on but sacks all remaining staff and saves enough to pay Bruno Fernandes’ wages for three days. Astute business. The Glazers continue to pay themselves millions in dividends, regardless, so much so that by spring 2027 the club is actually declared insolvent.",
      "So which way will it go? Relegation would likely be beneficial, as long as it alters the ownership and executive model and they are able to stop paying Antony’s wages.",
      "Go down and stay the same and worse will follow. It’s clear they are on a spiral of decline and that to break out of it, something radically different has to happen. With dreadful ownership, managerial performance and playing staff, it has to be imposed on them because they can’t be trusted to make a single good decision.",
      "Relegation would do that. If they don’t go down, they might be in the bottom six for a generation and be living proof of the stupidity of treating a club like a normal business and chasing money at every turn. When I was a kid Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Stoke, WBA and QPR were big, top flight clubs but haven’t been for a long time now. There’s your lesson, right there.",

It also means Sheffield United have one final throw of the dice to get promoted, before they no longer receive parachute payments and have to sell assets and cut costs. With that in mind, it seems out-dated that this game is now a one-off event at a neutral ground, where inevitably the importance and pressure of the occasion narrows the quality gap proven by league position over a 46 game season.",

This points total would have seen them promoted in 24 of the last 30 years of the First Division/Championship, and only the anomaly of the top two getting 100 points (first time that has happened) pushed them into third.",

You could argue that it shouldn’t be much of a contest (and wasn’t in fairness) but that’s still two additional games to navigate, usually to a team on a high after reaching the playoffs on the last day. Look at what happened to York in the National League. Their reward in the final for finishing 14 points clear of Sunderland? They got first pick of using their home kit in the final…which is only an advantage if both teams have the same colours anyway.",
      "Now, I’m not saying we scrap the play-offs as they are great value and provide entertainment towards the end of the season, but let’s take some inspiration from the National League and start rewarding league position a bit more. One-off games, favouring home advantage, with the 3rd place team automatically in the final, and 4th place in the semi-final, both given home advantage. Yes, no Wembley – sure, kept it for League One and League Two if you want to patronise fans with a ‘big day out’ but unless you’re a London or surrounding area-based team, it’s expensive for fans an often a nightmare logistically.",

      "Fair to say there have been Premier League final days with more riding on them than this one, but we still had a fascinating and ultimately wildly controversial scrap for Champions League places and Spurs completing their unimprovable banter season in perfect 10/10 fashion.",
      "",
      "1. No doubt about the biggest talking point of the final day. With the European battle the only thing of significance to be decided beyond gauche money-counting and just-above-the-relegation-zone banter, we were left with four games that mattered, and one of them turned decisively on what is sure to end up as one of the worst refereeing f*ck-ups of the campaign.",
      "Ten-man Aston Villa – more on that very shortly – were holding on to a point with something approaching unbecoming desperation against a Manchester United side starting to wonder if they would in fact ever score a goal ever again.",
      "Then it seemed things had got even better for them as Morgan Rogers pounced on Altay Bayindir’s howling failure to pick up the most straightforward of loose balls. Rogers duly rolled the ball into the net, only for the referee’s whistle to sound before it crossed the line.",
      "The significance of that was that it left VAR powerless to intervene and correct such an obvious mistake.",
      "Bayindir being preferred to Andre Onana in the wake of Wednesday’s night’s Europa League misery was always likely to become a talking point but few could have imagined it becoming such a decisive moment in how the entire final day panned out.",
      "",
      "2. And that’s because even a point looked to be enough for Villa to get themselves back into a tournament they played such a fine part in this season.",
      "And were it not for that officiating error they would surely have got it against so bereft a United side.",
      "Yet just minutes after Villa were robbed they neglected to mark Amad Diallo as he headed home United’s first Premier League goal at Old Trafford since Bruno Fernandes gave them the lead on the stroke of half-time against Arsenal in early March.",
      "A late Christian Eriksen penalty wrapped up the points for United, who had been the better side when Aston Villa still had 11 players and had utterly dominated – albeit with a very familiar absence of cutting edge – once the visitors were down to 10.",
      "Villa’s fury at the refereeing blunder that has cost them is righteous, but honest self-reflection will also inevitably lead them to examine their own individual errors and more general lack of verve in such a massive game.",
      "After a quarter-final exit in the Champions League and semi-final exit in the FA Cup, it has been a nearly season for Villa. Not a failure, yet not quite a success. And that’s a feeling exacerbated by the likes of Palace, Newcastle and Spurs shedding the ‘nearly not quite almost’ tags they’ve carried for decades.",
      "",
      "3. A word on the biggest individual error. Yet another rare blunder from Emi Martinez, the former Best Goalkeeper In The World who has endured a torrid season.",
      "He saved the worst for last with a ludicrous red card at Old Trafford. While Matty Cash’s underhit backpass did him absolutely no favours the keeper’s response was a complete brainfade.",
      "Even if we stop to ignore the sheer guileless obviousness of the most clear-cut attempt to deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity with not even a hint of regard for the ball, we cannot overlook the fact that this brazen foul and its inevitable outcome was committed on Rasmus Bloody Hojlund in a position where there was still a great deal of work left to turn opportunity into goal.",
      "If ever there were a striker against whom this kind of reckless desperation was unnecessary, it is surely Hojlund.",
      "Even had it been the final minute of the second rather than first half it would still all have seemed a bit unnecessary.",
      "And it points to a keeper whose brain is not where it ought to be. At his best Martinez was a keeper who would back himself one-on-one with anybody. Now he suffers total panicked collapse at the sight of Rasmus Hojlund. How far he done fell.",
      "",
      "4. With Villa’s combination of self-sabotage and infuriating misfortune handing Manchester United a vaguely positive end to a season of utter misery, Newcastle were able to stumble into the Champions League for the second time in three seasons despite ending their own campaign with a 1-0 home defeat to Everton.",
      "On another day, this was a result that could have left the season with a very different feel for Newcastle. An anti-climactic ending to a campaign of such joy. As it is, a season already secure in its place as one of the most memorable in Newcastle’s history gains another burnishing flourish.",
      "The Carabao victory with its accompanying release of drought-ending emotion feels both an age ago and curiously quaint now, it having been upstaged not once but twice by Crystal Palace and Tottenham pulling off similar tricks in superior competitions, but its significance and impact on Tyneside remains quite rightly undimmed.",
      "And the fact Newcastle were able to combine the catharsis of silverware with a rock-solid league season bodes well for the future. The next step is to make a more memorable stab at the Champions League than their unfortunate 2023/24 effort.",
      "",
      "5. The one team who never appeared in any real final-day danger of missing out on the Champions League was Manchester City, predictably and dare we say boringly taking care of business at Fulham.",
      "They were, entirely obviously, the team who could least afford to miss out; the one for whom such a misstep would represent unfathomable failure.",
      "Theirs was the most straightforward of the final-day tasks and they were the first movers of the final day with a nerve-settling opener after 20 minutes in West London. It remains, though, a bare minimum achievement at the end of a thoroughly trying and challenging season, one that ended without silverware – for the first time since Pep Guardiola’s first season – and for the first time in years a sense of on-field uncertainty to match the off-field noise that continues to swirl around them.",
      "",
      "6. Just before City scored their opening goal – the first of the day of any real significance – TNT Sport saw fit to put up the first ‘As Things Stand’ table of the day showing the current state of play for the teams third through seventh during their coverage of United-Villa.",
      "Surely this breaks all known ‘As Things Stand’ convention and the speed with which City subsequently scored a heavy punishment for their failure to hold their nerve just those few minutes longer.",
      "For the avoidance of any future doubt, an ‘As Things Stand’ might be acceptable on these occasions in the very first seconds of a match as a little reminder of what’s at stake but after that can only be deployed when there has been a material change to how things stand, accompanied – in accordance with the prophecy – by the commentator declaring ‘Long way to go, of course’.",
      "We trust this will be taken on board for next season.",
      "",
      "7. The other game that mattered greedily contained two teams with something to play for in Nottingham Forest and Chelsea. With a kind of grim joy-sapping inevitability it was the seasoned Champions League heads of Chelsea that prevailed over the upstarts who had done so much to make this season memorable but had faltered down the home straight.",
      "Chris Wood has had a stunning, career-best season but will now spend much of his summer thinking about the chance he missed when the game was still goalless. Such is football, such is life.",
      "Chelsea were by the end probably just about value for their win, and probably just about deserved the top-four place it gave them across the season as a whole, one that started and finished impressively but had a massive wobble in the middle.",
      "They remain less than the sum of their parts, but we guess that’s what happens when you spend a billion quid on seemingly random parts.",
      "",
      "8. Chelsea themselves provide the obvious silver lining for Nottingham Forest. While there is no denying the transformative potential lost by failing to hold a top-five position for just a little while longer, they also need look no further than today’s opponents to see the positive spin on today’s events.",
      "Forest now find themselves in a European competition that is enormously, tantalisingly winnable. Especially for two-time champions of Europe.",
      "And that positive spin really is needed only for today’s events. The season as a whole remains a triumph. If you told Forest fans back in August they would have something significant to play for on the final day of the season, today’s scenario is not the first that would have sprung to many minds.",
      "",
      "9. And the same applies to Aston Villa. That this Tottenham and this Manchester United were able to cut such a swathe through the Europa League should give Villans plenty to get excited about when the anger and frustration of today has died down.",
      "The damage to Villa’s long-term planning from today’s failure to secure back-to-back Champions League seasons is undeniable, especially for a club that has an alarming wage bill. But after a season watching first Newcastle and then Crystal Palace and then Spurs win silverware after long, long waits there has to be at least some small part of every Villa fan’s brain relishing the far greater chance they now have to get themselves a slice of that action.",
      "And we’ll say it again: not one fan among those whose teams secured top-five finishes today looked anything like as deliriously happy about it as Spurs fans did on Wednesday, or Palace fans last Saturday, or Newcastle fans back in March. No reason at all that can’t be Villa a year from now.",
      "",
      "10. Everywhere else there was only league position or pride or banter to play for. The day’s biggest party atmosphere was found, of course, at Anfield where a fine time was had by all. Palace gave Premier League champions Liverpool a guard of honour.",
      "Liverpool gave FA Cup winners Crystal Palace a guard of honour. And Liverpool extended their generosity as hosts to handing Palace an early lead.",
      "We don’t quite share certain pundits’ anger at the way Liverpool have played out the last rites of this season after securing the title with so very long to go.",
      "With the absence of any cup football to keep them sharp, it was inevitable that focus and levels would fall slightly after so emphatically achieving their target and it doesn’t take much of a drop in standards to bring you undone in a Premier League that might not have boasted the same quality of challengers to the title winners as recent years but contained unprecedented depth once the promoted trio had been cut adrift.",
      "Still, though. Not ideal to lose all momentum quite so dramatically in the final few weeks of the season.",
      "While they’ve been hugely impressive and worthy Premier League champions this season, we still require some convincing that Liverpool are any more than that. That Slot’s Liverpool might be at the start of an era of huge Premier League success.",
      "A big summer awaits Liverpool with significant incomings and at least one very significant outgoing – one who received a far kinder reception when introduced as a substitute during today’s party atmosphere – and care must be taken not to allow the understandable fashion in which they’ve closed out this season to bleed into the next.",
      "",
      "11. One thing that will bleed into next season – and one that will bite Aston Villa on the bum too with Martinez – is Ryan Gravenberch’s three-match ban for a straight red card minutes after he was shuffled in to emergency centre-back deployment as Liverpool chased the game.",
      "Given how little really rode on today’s game, that was perhaps a risk too far from Arne Slot even if the equaliser duly arrived from Who Else But That Man Mo Salah as he firmly rubber-stamped his own long-inevitable individual honours at the end of a spectacular campaign.",
      "",
      "12. Liverpool were chasing the game because of an early Palace goal on the back of a Conor Bradley error.",
      "Fair to say that however unimportant the game might have been in the wider scheme that of all the Liverpool players to have a final-day moment like that, Bradley is perhaps the worst.",
      "We feel a bit for Bradley. He’s a player of real talent and huge promise but also one upon whom all manner of unfair hopes and expectations and baggage are now being projected.",
      "We get why Liverpool fans would love Trent Alexander-Arnold’s heir to be another homegrown academy graduate. But that is also just statistically an unlikely thing to happen. Maybe in time Bradley will prove himself worthy, but the talk that he is already some kind of ready-made replacement for the departing TAA is for the birds.",
      "",
      "13. So, Spurs. Brilliant – 10/10, no notes. We’d been very clear that we required whoever won the Europa League to finish 17th because that is so much funnier than 15th or 16th could ever hope to be, even though those are also very funny finishing positions for a Champions League qualifier.",
      "We were supremely confident in Spurs’ ability to deliver, and not just because we’d watched the parade on Friday evening and then seen how alarmingly many of those lads were in the starting XI here. Hats off to Brennan Johnson for playing all 96 minutes here after looking extremely tired and emotional by the end of Friday’s festivities. It’s great being young.",
      "No, the main reason we were supremely confident in Spurs is that we’ve also been watching them in the league all season. An early penalty for Dominic Solanke did briefly lift them as high as a profoundly unfunny 14th, but there was no need for alarm.",
      "Even without hangovers, Spurs had already once this season managed to comprehensively spaff away a half-time lead against Brighton and it had a sense of inevitability about it here from the moment a shambolically-defended corner allowed Jack Hinshelwood to equalise.",
      "When another uncleared corner led to a second Hinshelwood and Brighton goal, it was already a question of how many Spurs might concede as hangovers literal and metaphorical really kicked in. Superbly, the answer was in fact four, the last of which, in the very final minute of the season, was enough to at long last send Spurs’ gravity-defying goal difference into negative numbers for the first time in the entire season. Absolute poetry.",
      "Spurs have completed one of the funniest seasons in history and, while there was never any real scope for today to provide the funniest part of it, they could have done little more to give the season the ending it absolutely deserved.",
      "It’s hard to even imagine how any team could even begin to attempt a season more ludicrous than this one, but we also know if there’s one team that can pull it off, it is Tottenham themselves.",
      "",
      "14. After all, just like all TV shows (has anyone actually crunched the numbers on this, as an aside, because it feels like it’s surely a reach?) season three is better than season two. But as Ange Postecoglou himself pointed out, sometimes TV shows will kill off the main character.",
      "He was absolutely right to let Tottenham’s players enjoy Wednesday’s long-overdue success to its fullest, and his reasons for doing so were spot on: you have to make success like Spurs achieved in Bilbao as memorably enjoyable as you possibly can so that players are happy to, as Ange put it, climb the mountain again next time you ask them.",
      "As such it seems churlish to suggest that today’s frankly inevitable outcome – even the way the game panned out was on brand for both Tottenham and indeed drunk people with its early promise giving way to confusion and regret– might harm Postecoglou’s chances of getting that third season.",
      "It probably has, though. The sheer scale of the eventual defeat means it probably isn’t as shoulder-shruggingly irrelevant as it may first appear.",
      "Most obviously, it’s just not a one-off. It’s not even the first second-half collapse Spurs have suffered this season against Brighton. If what happened on Wednesday and Friday put some fresh doubts in the minds of Daniel Levy and the Spurs decision-makers, today might just have assuaged them.",
      "And brutal as it is, and as much as we have ourselves come round to the idea that Ange has now earned the right to fail properly here if that’s what he wants, he also can’t really have any complaints.",
      "Even allowing for the reasons Spurs completely sacked off the league campaign and the ultimate vindication of that approach, they were able to sack it off because it had already gone disastrously wrong.",
      "They have now set a record for the most defeats by any non-relegated team in a 38-game Premier League season, and finished the campaign five points closer to a historically bad bottom three than they did the top half.",
      "",
      "15. A significant win for Brighton, though, even if events elsewhere took away the last hopes that eighth place might bring with it European football.",
      "Results today falling in such a way that Brighton end up closer to the European qualifiers than any of their fellow mid-table overachievers (your Brentfords, your Bournemouths, the Fulhams of this world) might not mean a great deal but can shift the perception slightly on where they sit in the Premier League’s brave new world where Man United and Spurs can be this catastrophically bad.",
      "",
      "16. Arsenal at least managed to avoid repeating Man City’s trick of failing to beat Southampton. But only just, mind, and still find themselves confirmed as one of the Premier League’s worst ever runners-up.",
      "We still think when they buy a striker they win the league – the glibly simplistic take on this season that involves ignoring all manner of things such as Liverpool taking their foot entirely off the gas is that converting even half their draws into wins would have been enough to take the title – but for now they must accept their trophyless fate and role of punchbag as 17 years of frustration rushes out towards them from their neighbours.",
      "There’s no getting away from it at this time: whatever happens to any team in football, the joke is somehow always on Arsenal. Warra trophy."

      "Aston Villa have missed out on the Champions League, finishing sixth in the Premier League after their 2-0 defeat to Man Utd on the final day.",

      "Villa played the entire second half with ten men after Emiliano Martinez was sent off, but they felt they should have taken the lead with 15 minutes remaining.",
      "Bramall ruled out the goal as he thought Morgan Rogers fouled Altay Bayindir, who was deemed to have had two hands on the ball when he was contacted, though this was not the case.",

      "‘The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore, the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.’",
      "Man Utd added to Villa’s frustrations as they went straight up the other end to break the deadlock through Amad Diallo before Christian Eriksen’s late penalty made it 2-0.",
      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein has revealed that the Villans ‘plan to make an official complaint’ to the Premier League regarding this incident, as they ‘feel a more experienced referee should have been selected to officiate a game of such magnitude.",
      "Former Premier League referee and ex-head of the PGMOL Keith Hackett claims Bramall had a “howler” with his “huge error”.",
      "“The goalkeeper does not have control of the ball it is loose and the actions of the forward are not dangerous,” Hackett told Football Insider.",
      "READ: Premier League prize money table revealed: Liverpool break record with Bournemouth biggest final-day earners",
      "“The referee at that point committed an howler by blowing to stop play.",
      "“He should have waited the outcome and after the goal was scored the situation could them be reviewed by the VAR.",
      "“Looking at the clip, the goal should have been allowed to stand. A huge error by the referee.”",
      "Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn thinks it was an “incredible decision” and he revealed Bramall’s immediate reaction to the incident.",
      "“Tough game especially in the circumstances. I don’t think anyone in the dressing room or anyone watching the game felt we deserved to win. Manchester United deserved to win. They were the better team and were on front foot. But the decision is incredible,” McGinn said.",
      "“I think everyone wanted the correct decisions when the VAR was implemented. You watch rugby, even if the referee has awarded a try and it’s wrong, its overturned. It’s so so hard to take especially when the impact it has on us, as a club and a team, is so big. Its’ really, really tough to take and handle. I don’t think we deserved to win but if you were 1-0 up at that point and all you need is a point to get to the Champions League, it’s costly.",
      "“Moving forward, the rule has to be looked at as the correct decisions were not getting made at the end of the day. I think [referee] Thomas [Bramall] knew. It probably wasn’t fair on him at that moment either. The boys are gutted. But European football three years in a row, we need to hold onto that and see what next season brings.”",
      "When asked whether the referee acknowledged the mistake, he continued: “He didn’t really know what to say.",
      "“Because of the impact it has on us as players and our careers, the club, you are obviously angry. I think he is a young referee who has progressed very quickly. Maybe we could look at having more experienced referees. I don’t know. It’s just an incredible decision and makes today even worse than it should be.”"

      "Man United’s Finances\nDear Editor,",
      "I am no financial mastermind but, after about an hour or so of fact finding, I can’t help reach the conclusion that Manchester United are in absolutely really big trouble.",
      "Over the past five seasons, United have sold at a rate of 25% of the full market value. From what I can see, they have sold £708.3M worth of talent for only £172.5M. This is astonishingly bad when compared to the likes of City, Real Madrid, and Benfica and even clubs like Brighton, Bournemouth, and Leverkusen.",
      "Over the past five seasons, United have bought at a rate of 65% of the full market value. From what I can see, they have bought £681.3M worth of talent against their value of £1,024.6B. However, their current squad is valued at £516.3M, so somehow the value of their current players has decreased by nearly exactly 50%. My goodness, that’s shocking.",
      "If they were to sell their whole entire squad at a rate that they’ve been going (25% of full value), they will only be able to generate £129.1M which is based on the above patterns over the past five seasons. The BBC have also recently reported that United owe £272M in outstanding transfer payments to other clubs, £156M of which is due this summer. It’s not a stretch of a conclusion to say that selling their whole entire squad would not see off this summer’s bill alone.",
      "(Source: transfermarkt)",
      "Changing tack, over the past five seasons, United have paid their players, and wait for this, a staggering £1,040.3B. This season, United’s annual wage bill is £173.8M, but their commitment to the current players full contract lengths is a colossal £567.7M in future salary spend.",
      "(Source: capology)",
      "At the start of the year, the BBC reported £370M losses for United (including £113M in 2024) over the last five years.",
      "To indicate the scale of the problem, this guy thinks that even selling a whole squad at a rate they’ve been going coupled with total TV/prize money for finishing 17th (£253.1M) is absolutely dwarfed by their reported losses in recent years and by already committed salary spend (£937.7M)",

      "It’s one hell of a huge summer at Manchester United. If the future is bleak right now after the EUROPA League final defeat and sticking with a manager whose 3-4-3 formation is ill-suited to the Premier League and the players at his disposal, I think this could be just the start. The above indicates that United not only have to sell, but they have to sell at a 75% loss from transfer fees as well as hoping that buying clubs do not insist on United paying most of the outgoing player’s wages. And that’s just to avoid FPP sanctions if that is now even possible. Do not expect the ownership to gamble money they just don’t have on signings to keep them in the Premier League. Do not expect clubs to sell to United as they still owe transfer costs. Do not expect players to agree to move on without compensating the rest of their contracts. Expect to lose players for peanuts to offset this. Expect the club to make no new signings. Expect the club to rely on youth. Expect FFP points deductions. Expect relegation next season followed by the Championship.\nRich (let’s hope for a better season next season at The Hawthorns), WBA.",

Not when there are so many more better, actual words, said with a hard ‘t’ to be employed, but never against my own players.

No excuse for booing TAA. He was and always will be a cast-iron LFC Legend. But I separate players from club and I’ve never wanted his sweaty match-worn shirt to cuddle up to at night, nor a beer-stained napkin with his moniker or even to ask him what his favourite colour is.

      "I just read John Nicholson’s op ed on football being boring and felt compelled to share the solution I found.",
      "Traditionally, I am an England and Arsenal fan.  I didn’t bother with the whole favourite team in Scotland, Spain and Italy thing.",
      "I fell away from watch England during the C@nty years,  the John Terry, Steven Gerrard, Wayne Bridge stuff.  They were all such scummers I just stopped watching. Now it’s WC and European Cup only.  I also can’t handle the media tripe that surrounds England games. It’s pitched like a shit East Enders.",
      "Arsenal also got a bit boring too, from the tail end of Wenger even until now.   It’s not that the football is bad per se but the entire wrapper, leading us to today where I watch some games and try to avoid the Henry, Carragher, Richards’ cringe fest on TNT.",
      "What I found, as a brilliant replacement, was Five Guys FC.  A five-a-side outfit who play up in North London.  Games come with sound effects (ha-dou-ken), comedy commentators, jeopardy, wins and losses.  It’s great.  After a few minutes you completely get into the game, and as the whole thing is on YouTube you can watch it at will.  I’m sure there are a load of variation on this, but it’s well worth diving in.",
      "Moreover, they are clearly enjoying themselves where so much of football is a joyless obligation (thanks Keys and Co).  If you want painful obligations play a From Software game instead (if you know, you know)",
      "So next time, instead of shelling out sum on Sky or tickets that leave you 100m from the players, tune in to something like Five Guys instead.",
      "Enjoy. Thank me later.\nAlexander",

      "John Nicholson does love to bang his drum.This from the Europa League final: “People have found the stupidity of the winner playing in the Champions League amusing and a bit pathetic.”",
      "I take it you think this road to CL qualification should be closed, like Arsene Wenger? And that you’re saying this because of who the teams are and the way it highlights the dominance of money.",
      "However, this seems like back-to-front thinking. Surely this dominance is most evident in league performance where a quality squad gives an edge over time? Despite this year’s winners, it still leaves cup success as the best route for an underdog. A shot at the big time. A chance to live the football fairytale.",
      "And why shouldn’t there be a back door to the big money competition? An opportunity for those that can’t usually afford it; those who use a targeted approach to climb the qualification ladder to glory.",
      "A way to break the glass ceiling and for fans to have all the excitement that goes with it? Why not? Next season Hibs and Palace fans can think…’if we win it – we’ll be in the CL! ‘.",
      "Why would you want to steal that dream from them?",
      "Granted, Man Utd and even Spurs are not little guys but you can’t just change the rules when *they* win or you’d be supporting structural prejudice right? Rules have to apply equally.",
      "The ‘problem’ is that the Prem has more good, wealthy teams than CL places which leaves CL standard teams qualifying for the second and third tier continental competitions. This, of course, reduces the very opportunity I’m describing above. (I know, 17th, but I’m making a broader point.)",
      "I’m no capitalist, however I don’t have a problem with healthy competition, especially if success demonstrates a better idea. In this case the almost even distribution of TV money in the EPL**. (And PSR – based on absolute figures rather than percentages – seems to be working too.)",
      "The Prem is the richest because it’s the most watched because, I think, it’s the most competitive. For the above stated reason.",
      "Rather than complain other leagues need to catch up. I know you love Scottish football but surely even you can see the harm that permanently uncompetitive leagues are causing? (Perhaps including cognitive acuity; you previously said Scots now view 3rd as first (!) Something else you share with Wenger.)",
      "I applaud this aspect of PL governance and say the answer is either to reduce everybody else’s CL allocation – make the CL smaller – or increase the allocation to 6 or 7 for English teams.",
      "Maybe you’re banging your drum so loud you can’t hear yourself think.",
      "**My preference would be a more progressive distribution; the lowest revenue clubs get more TV money than the highest. Not only adding to the general competitiveness but helping to bridge the chasm to the top of the Championship. Which is a problem that needs attention.\nHartley MCFC Somerset",

      "Mackems\nSurely we can expect Brighton & Hove Albion to file a protest at Sunderland’s promotion to the Premier League. Everybody knows what happens to seagulls there.",
      "For my part, I’m rather happy. I would have been pleased with the thumping it looked like the Blades were going to deliver after the first goal — when Sunderland loses, I like it to be big —  but Mayenda’s goal made it an interesting match, and even I couldn’t begrudge Watson that winner. So we’ll get two Tyne-Wear derbies next season, and that’s a fantastic consolation prize. And as the worst of the promoted sides, I’ll see a lot more mackem losses next year; maybe they’ll even reclaim the record Derby stole from them.\nChris C, Toon Army DC (Howay, not Ha’way, man)",

      "Oh my goodness, I can’t speak right now so have to type! Arsenal are Champions League Winners! In the biggest football game of the past week, this underdog Arsenal team has defeated the mighty powerhouse of Barcelona, a team in their 5th consecutive final, having won 3 of the previous 4, a team who annihilated Chelsea 8-2 over their semi-final legs, a team with 4 Ballon d’Or trophies and many of the best players in the game in their squad!",
      "It was an incredible battling display by the girls who have had an incredible European journey this season. Having started in the first round of the qualifying competition, the first team to do this and get to a final, having some early setbacks, changing managers, being behind after the first legs in their quarter-final against Real Madrid and again in their semi-final against 8-time winners Lyon, but turning those around with great performances.",
      "The back line were superb in this game, repelling anything that came at them. England captain Leah Williamson was deservedly player of the game and made so many clearances and good decisions tonight to lead the way! A young woman who was a mascot when Arsenal last won it in 2007.",
      "Kim Little finally getting her hands on this trophy after all her years of service. Players like Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly justifying their decisions to join the club and fighting for everything in the game, along with the battling Katie McCabe, Caitlin Foord and Mariona Caldentey (who left Barcelona as a Champions League winner last season to join Arsenal!).",
      "And a whole squad contributing like Stina Blackstenius and Beth Mead coming on to combine for the winning goal. Just incredible, and to see all the emotions of these young girls who had these dreams and have fought to get their game on a bigger stage, it was so pure and refreshing.",
      "In my years of watching football, two things were missing for me to see, an England tournament win and Arsenal winning the Champions League, and now both have been completed by the women’s teams. As I had to when England won the Euro’s, I’ve again had to fight back the tears tonight watching what it means to them all. What an amazing night and journey for these girls and us fans. Let the haters hate! Thank you AWFC!\nAWFC Steve",

      "New Kit Time\nNUFC’s kit for next season dropped, and I’m on board with it. At first, the “tartan” pattern (traditional to the region, per the Adidas marketing fluff) that makes the stripes’ edges look fuzzy from a distance looked wrong to me, but having checked out the closeup photos in the club’s webshop, it’s grown on me a good deal. The stripe treatment is really an elaboration of the 1995-96 grandad-collar kit, which featured a similar stitched-look border, and the subtle patterning of perforations (or black flecks) evident in the white stripes with the close-up shot on the club shop is rather cool. The collar is okay, and I dig the integration of den drei streifen in white into a black shoulder. It’s really well integrated.",
      "The badge has been refined: more detailed and vibrant, with texturing in the black stripes. Which is weird, because the club has announced their intent to update the badge to improve its marketability as a logo, with supporters’ input, naturally. They seem to want something simpler and more stylized. Some fans will resist, but I’m open to a change. I’ve seen a “deconstructed” monotone version of the current badge that would look very nice indeed. We may see two versions of this shirt if they make a decision soon. For this current shirt, I suspect they’ve lightened the blue of the badge banner a bit to match the blue highlights, but maybe it’s just a lighting thing. The shirts will have a white back, though, guaranteeing we’ll wear an away or third kit at Leeds, Fulham and Spurs.",
      "I’ve seen only rumors and fan mockups for the away kit (and nothing at all for a third kit, which there will certainly be, and certainly (sigh) in white and green), but I’d like to see a sash kit in the claret and the blue of badge. Tha’d be canny, like.",
      "Speaking of claret and blue, Villa’s new home kit is class. Elegant, even. But they should’ve done the badge in blue, like the trim, to set it off from the sponsor logos and perhaps made it a touch smaller. The black-and-grey away kit is nondescript. I guess it’ll look good with jeans. Meh.",
      "I get at least some of the architectural cues watermarked into Chelsea’s new home kit, but it’s another near miss for me, Clive. At least there’s no blaze orange. And the white at the collar is nice. Nee hyem kit yet. Same with Arsenal and Citeh.",
      "Arsenal’s new kit looks clean and slick enough, but the best Arsenal kits have white sleeves, not white shoulders. The 2014-15 Puma kit was perhaps their best-looking shirt ever. Nike’s 2010-11 effort disagrees violently. The JVC and Dreamcast kits are classic, but largely for the sponsors; most of them were a little pants, with too much fussiness and elaboration with the red. I think Adidas should be looking back at the late 70s kits. Those are classics.",
      "There’s one clear exception to the white-sleeves-rule rule, and that is the Arsenal Women’s gold-numbered “Winners 25” shirts, already on sale in the wake of their Champions League triumph. Congratulations to them!",
      "Manchester City’s new home kit is not good at all. I love a sash shirt like I love Newcastle United victories, but that’s one half-assed sash. It’s not simple and bold, it looks like sun-glare on a bus in summer traffic. The photos on the PL’s new-kits article make it look as though the left shoulder fades to white, like a cloud. That would be cool, given the sky-blue shirt.  But the photos are just overexposed, because even the match version available on the club shop is straight blue.",
      "I’m looking forward to the rest of the new crop. Especially Crystal Palace; they usually do something bold and often nail it; they may even add a flourish for their FA Cup win. NUFC didn’t do so for the Carabao, as far as I can tell. Which is good, because the FA Cup would better merit it, and It only felt like out first trophy.\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

      "Chelsea had already successfully defended their title. There was vague interest as to whether Liverpool could finish ahead of Manchester United as runners-up, but mid-table Charlton popping up to Old Trafford meant it never seemed likely. Birmingham, West Brom and Sunderland had already succumbed to their fate.",
      "The remaining kernel of intrigue was being cooked up in north London – although speculation that it was by an Arsenal season ticket holder at the Marriott remains unfounded.",
      "The Gunners had reached the Champions League final that season but Tottenham were in control of qualification for the subsequent season’s campaign – and at this stage the outcome seems obvious. It was a tired and unimaginative reworking of the previous campaign’s plot, in which Everton pipped Liverpool for fourth but the Reds earned passage to the European Cup by winning it. But viewers were engrossed nonetheless.",
      "Spurs had a one-point lead heading into their final game, away at West Ham. Arsenal hosted Wigan in Highbury’s last match. It seemed like a straightforward sprint finish. But then Martin Jol had 10 players fall to illness overnight and his side went into disarray, slipping to a 2-1 defeat as the Gunners came from behind to win 4-2. Tottenham tried to have their match postponed, or at least kick-off pushed back a few hours on the same day. They then explored the possibility of a replay and considered taking the matter to court. Claims of food poisoning were thoroughly investigated. Callum Davenport, by his own admission gave “this whopper in a Chinese takeaway container” for a stool sample as part of an internal investigation.",
      "The eventual conclusion was that a bout of norovirus tore through the squad but the accepted conspiracy is that Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe and company were felled by a dodgy lasagne at the last hurdle.",
      "",
      "9) 1999/2000\nThe comprehensive story threads were once again absent as this final day essentially hinged on one fixture with two direct consequences. Liverpool had a first Champions League campaign within reach, occupying fourth place but sitting behind Leeds and what was then the third and last European Cup spot that could be secured through league position. The Whites traipsed up to face an exciting West Ham side of Ferdinand, Lampard, Di Canio, Wanchope and Lomas, returning only with a goalless draw which offered Gerard Houllier and his Reds an unexpected opportunity.",
      "All they had to do was beat Bradford, who had spent all but a single gameweek since the start of January in the bottom three. That mattered nought when David Wetherall thundered a Gunnar Halle cross past Sander Westerveld in the first half, nor when the Bantams defended manfully to keep Michael Owen and Emile Heskey out, with Robbie Fowler omitted from the squad.",
      "Liverpool made the best of an inexplicably bad situation, embracing their UEFA Cup consolation so much it comprised one third of the subsequent season’s technical Treble. Bradford went down with a whimper in 2000/01 by comparison.",

      "8) 2006/07\nThe agenda was again dominated by events at the lower end. Sheffield United started in 16th, ahead of West Ham, Wigan and the pair of Charlton and Watford, whose relegations had already been confirmed. Three points separated as many teams when it came to taking up the last place on the second-tier scrapheap – and two of them were playing each other.",
      "Sheffield United could have avoided defeat at home to Wigan to render moot whatever result West Ham achieved at Old Trafford. But Paul Scharner scored after 14 minutes at the DW Stadium to make matters that little more agitated. Wigan and West Ham were staying up. Then uncle Jon Stead’s brave header swapped the Latics with the Blades.",
      "As half-time beckoned across the country, Carlos Tevez soaked himself in narrative to the delight of Neil Warnock, sending the Hammers clear. It became a straight shootout between Sheffield United and Wigan, who regained the lead at Bramall Lane when Phil Jagielka handled the ball; David Unsworth, a Blade until leaving that January on a free, and who had missed a penalty in a 0-0 draw against Blackburn the prior September, beat Paddy Kenny from 12 yards in first-half stoppage time. Danny Webber hit the post when through on goal. Lee McCulloch was sent off with 16 minutes remaining. But Wigan endured to send an embittered Warnock down.",

      "7) 1996/97\nAnother Champions League implosion from Liverpool proved to be a satisfactory entrée to a relegation-centred main course. The Reds had been a point behind Manchester United with a four-point and one-game buffer to Arsenal by late February, but dreadful form down the final straight – P10 W4 D3 L3 F14 A14 – obliterated that advantage. Defeat at Wimbledon in their penultimate match meant both Arsenal and Newcastle had closed to within two points of second place and the only other European Cup qualification spot alongside champions Manchester United.",
      "Arsenal beat Derby; Newcastle pummelled Nottingham Forest and increased their superior goal difference. Liverpool needed to win at Sheffield Wednesday but went behind to O’Neill Donaldson in the 75th minute and could only pull one back through Jamie Redknapp. All three sides finished on 68 points but Newcastle ventured to the Champions League while Arsenal and Liverpool were headed to the UEFA Cup.",
      "Middlesbrough, Coventry and Nottingham Forest occupied the bottom three places, with Forest already gone. Only Southampton and Sunderland were in reach and the door was opened when they lost at Aston Villa and Wimbledon respectively. Boro could only draw against Leeds and were made to rue their January points deduction, but Coventry took full advantage of the circumstances by beating Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Traffic problems meant that game had to be kicked off 15 minutes later than the rest – Jimmy Hill must have been proud – and player-manager Gordon Strachan later claimed to be “too nervous” to play as he remained an unused substitute. It kept him fit enough to leap into the welcoming arms of Dion Dublin at full-time.",

      "6) 1993/94\nManchester City were 16th on 44 points. Southampton were 17th on 42. Sheffield United were 18th on goals scored. Ipswich were 19th on goal difference. Everton were 20th on 41 points. Oldham were 21st on 39. Swindon Town were gone.",
      "Everton were 2-0 down at home to Wimbledon after 20 minutes, their predicament seemingly unsalvageable. Oldham led Norwich after 14 minutes but their inferior goal difference required Southampton, Sheffield United and Ipswich all to lose heavily. Manchester City were dragged in that little bit closer when Sheffield Wednesday went 1-0 up. Southampton fell behind to West Ham. By half-time, Sheffield United were beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and had four points and three teams between themselves and Everton. Manchester City equalised for the point they needed at Sheffield Wednesday. Southampton would concede a late Lee Chapman equaliser at West Ham but were clear.",
      "But Everton staged an improbable comeback to lead Wimbledon, thus taking Ipswich – drawing at Blackburn – down with Oldham. The Tractor Boys could do nothing to affect their own fate as they laboured to a stalemate, yet two late goals from Mark Stein at Chelsea, the last in stoppage time, spared them and put Sheffield United into the relegation zone for the first and most crucial time on the final day.",
      "",
      "No team had been relegated going into the final day and two points separated Norwich, Southampton, Crystal Palace and West Brom. The Canaries tumbled down the mine and gave the rest a chance by capitulating at Fulham. The other three were staying up at various points across the afternoon. Saints were ahead against Manchester United but were pegged back and then lost. Palace came from behind to lead Charlton before Jonathan Fortune’s late equaliser. West Brom started the day bottom, were stranded at Christmas and needed the rest to slip up, but capitalised through Geoff Horsfield and Kieran Richardson in the second half against Portsmouth. Some Pompey fans filtered onto the Hawthorns pitch upon realising that their defeat had helped relegate Southampton.",

      "",
      "4) 2002/03\nOn the line this time was Roman Abramovich’s heart. The media had dubbed Chelsea and Liverpool’s Champions League qualification showdown as ‘the £20m match’ but that barely covered a fraction of what was ultimately on offer.",
      "The Blues were fourth and had the Reds pipped on goal difference heading into a ludicrously poised last match at Stamford Bridge – winner takes all. Chelsea faced financial ruin if they failed. Sami Hyypia opened the scoring but Marcel Desailly almost immediately responded. Jesper Gronkjaer completed the turnaround within the half-hour and in doing so, intrinsically changed Chelsea’s future.",
      "Blackburn secured a UEFA Cup spot ahead of Everton by beating Tottenham 4-0, while the Toffees inevitably lost 2-1 to Manchester United despite Kevin Campbell’s best efforts.",
      "In terms of relegation, West Brom and Sunderland were adrift. It became a case of one out of three joining them, despite Leeds, Bolton and West Ham all having reached That Magical 40-point Mark. Leeds beat Aston Villa 3-1. Bolton beat Boro 2-1. West Ham could only draw 2-2 with Birmingham as they became Too Good To Go Down poster boys.",
      "",
      "3) 2021/22\nA vintage slice of final-day Barclays. Manchester City produced a title-winning conclusion mad enough to be the second maddest final day they’ve had, while Leeds leapfrogged Burnley to avoid the drop and, most astonishingly of all, Spurs never even threatened to Spurs things up for a single second as they cruised back into the Champions League.",
      "Of course, most eyes were fixed on the Etihad when all they had to do, with a one-point lead at the summit, was not balls it up against Villa. Not this brilliant Villa inspired by one of the greatest managerial upgrades ever; Steven Gerrard’s Villa. On paper, it should have been a procession. But City unexpectedly fell behind to Matty Cash and, while recklessly searching for an equaliser, they went 2-0 down thanks to Philippe Coutinho.",
      "Gerrard and Coutinho winning the title for Liverpool? Oh Lord.",
      "But Liverpool were struggling to take care of their own business. They were level with Wolves all the while City opened the door. Never once during the afternoon did the Reds move to the summit. By the time Mo Salah had come off the bench to put them ahead at Anfield, City had done a six-minute madness and the title was staying at the Etihad.",
      "The only significant last-day twist came at the bottom where Leeds, at Brentford, had to better Burnley’s result at home to Newcastle to leapfrog the Clarets and condemn them to relegation. Both games finished 2-1 in favour of Leeds, who went down with Sam Allardyce the following season anyway as Burnley climbed back up.",
      "",
      "2) 1994/95\nYou know exactly where this is going. It was, by definition of it subjectively being ranked second here, not the greatest of Premier League final days, but it was the first truly spectacular, fabric-altering one. It really was breathtaking when Brian Deane rifled in an excellent goal to equalise against Tottenham and secure the point Leeds needed to pip Newcastle to the last UEFA Cup place.",
      "There was a modicum of drama elsewhere. Jamie Redknapp scored a sublime last-gasp free-kick he dare not celebrate to beat Blackburn, the Premier League leaders who had been winning and heading for the title until John Barnes equalised in the 64th minute at Anfield. In doing so, Liverpool had betrayed club icon Kenny Dalglish and provided Manchester United with a gilt-edged chance.",
      "Alex Ferguson’s players had plenty of those against West Ham, of course. But let’s just say Ludek Miklosko need never buy his own pints in one half of Merseyside or Lancashire.",

      "1) 2011/12\nMartin Tyler receives some understandable criticism, such is his inherent bias against every team, but he absolutely nailed it here: that really was Aguerooooooooooooooo, and we surely will never see anything like this ever again. The most rudimentary explanation is that Manchester City had to only match Manchester United’s result at Sunderland when they hosted QPR to win their first Premier League title, and they did. That misses out a couple of key incidents and some absurd context but still.",
      "Chief conspiracy theorist Wayne Rooney covered the side of the bargain for Ferguson’s team with a routine back-post header at a pliably mid-table Sunderland. Pablo Zabaleta restored Manchester City’s advantage on goal difference with the opener against QPR. But Rangers, fuelled by a relegation battle and some residual resentment from manager Mark Hughes, sacked in acrimony by City two and a half years prior, took inexplicable control through Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie. It was the ultimate bottle job, until Edin Dzeko and some Argentinean fella staged a stoppage-time intervention.",
      "That alone would mark this final day out as the greatest. But there were layers playing out in the background, such as QPR staying up despite their own implosion and being able to freely celebrate with Manchester City as Bolton succumbed to a 77th-minute Jon Walters equaliser at Stoke. Arsenal gripped on to third place for dear life ahead of Tottenham, although it wasn’t until Chelsea won the Champions League six days later that Spurs learned fourth was only good enough for the Europa League. Because Spurs."

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 12:03, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "Monday 26 May 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Aston Villa have made an official complaint to the PGMOL over the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their Premier League final-day match against Man Utd, which Champions League-chasing Villa lost after having a goal controversially ruled out.",
      "The defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the league, meaning they missed out on Champions League football next season when just a point would have seen them secure the top-five finish necessary to qualify.",
      "After the first-half sending-off of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, Villa's 10 players thought they had taken the lead in the second half when Morgan Rogers poked the ball free from Altay Bayindir and curled the ball into an open net, only for Bramall to disallow the goal for an alleged foul on the United goalkeeper.",
      "The referee awarded a free kick to United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession, only for replays to show he did not have both hands on the ball when Rogers poked it away. Because Bramall blew his whistle before Rodgers' shot crossed the goalline, VAR was unable to intervene.",
      "Villa were down to 10 after Emi Martinez's red card late in the first half, but thought they went ahead midway through the second with the game still at 0-0.",
      "Under little pressure, Man Utd keeper Altay Bayindir made a mess of sliding onto the ball in his box. Villa's Morgan Rogers dislodged the ball before swivelling and firing into the empty net, seemingly giving the visitors the lead. At the time, the goal would have seen Villa climb into the Champions League places with less than 20 minutes left on the final day of the season.",
      "The goal was disallowed by referee Thomas Bramall, who adjudged Rogers to have kicked the ball out of Bayindir's grasp. However, replays show the United 'keeper had lost possession before Rogers' intervention.",
      "Because Bramall blew the whistle before the goal was scored, VAR could not intervene and the goal did not stand.",
      "Amad Diallo scored for Man Utd three minutes later before Christian Eriksen's penalty doubled United's advantage in the 87th minute. The 2-0 loss at Old Trafford meant Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference, while a point would have been enough to lift them into fifth following Newcastle's 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "On Sunday evening Villa confirmed a complaint had been made, saying: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today's game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today's fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.",
      "\"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "Bramall has officiated 11 games in the top-flight of English football this season and 17 other match officials have taken charge of more fixtures than him throughout the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said post-match. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession,\" read a Premier League match centre statement on X.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "\"The goal (being) disallowed was the key moment but overall they deserve it more. We were resilient with one player less and we could score one goal. It was a good opportunity to continue being resilient and keep the result.",
      "\"I speak to the referee and he knows it (was a mistake). But I don't want to speak about VAR.",
      "\"We go to Europa League but we were close to Champions League. Our objective (at the start of the season) was to be in Europe, and we have to be happy and proud with what we did.\"",

      "\"No one in the dressing room or watching felt like we deserved to win. Man Utd were the better team but the decision is incredible.",
      "\"Everyone, when VAR was implemented, wanted correct decisions. I know it is the rule but it is so hard to take, especially with the impact it has on us.",
      "\"To whistle at that point, it is hard to take. All you need is a point to get into the Champions League.\""

      "Speaking to the Manchester United supporters on the pitch after the game, Ruben Amorim addressed his team's struggles and told them the good days are coming.",
      "\"First of all, I want to apologise for this season. I know you are very disappointed with me and with the team,\" he said.",
      "\"Secondly, I want to say thank you. We are very grateful for your support over the season, which I know was really bad.",

      "\"Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you, the storm is coming. Today, after this disastrous season, I want to tell you, the good days are coming.",
      "\"If there is one club in the world that can overcome any situation, any disaster, it's our club. It's Manchester United.",
      "\"Now I want to say sorry also to my players, sometimes I was not fair, but I try always to be honest with you guys.",
      "\"Thank you very much, see you next season.\""

      "Gary Neville says Ruben Amorim must end the \"negativity spiral\" at Manchester United and \"get a grip\" of the club after a nightmare season.",
      "After that defeat, United defender Luke Shaw said: \"All of us have to question ourselves. Are we good enough to be here? Because for this club, this season it's not acceptable. We know that and it's down to us.\"",
      "Neville believes those comments are an alarming reflection of how the players are feeling and Amorim must swiftly move to correct the culture in the club and dressing room if he is to achieve a significant improvement next season.",
      "\"I want to point towards Luke Shaw's interview, where he talked about, 'we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and decide whether we're good enough to play for Manchester United',\" said Neville on The Overlap show It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"Luke, it's not your job to determine that. A player at Manchester United should have no control as to whether they're there or not. The manager of the football club decides whether you're good enough to play in that football team.",
      "\"When the players are starting to come out and question publicly whether they're good enough to play for the club, you know how bad it is internally there. You imagine what they're saying to each other inside.",
      "\"I have this thing about negativity spiral in my businesses, in my life. If I hear the energy-sapping negativity spiral starting to move, whereby you can feel people starting to have an influence over the others, and Luke's an experienced player now, honestly, I think you've got to wipe it out. You've got to wipe out every single player in that dressing room who doesn't believe that they've got total and utter confidence to play for that football club.",
      "\"There were some players on that pitch and some players on the bench who I think can still do a good job for Manchester United. I don't believe it's a case of get rid of them all. I think there's some talent in there. I believe that. And this idea that they don't care, I'll repeat what I've said many, many times again, never, ever think that of football players.",
      "\"Do they want to lose football matches? Do they want to be criticised on social media? The answer is no. They do care. They've worked thousands of hours to get to this position of playing for the club, but the club is eating them alive. The club is eating them alive, it's too big for them.\"",
      "Neville called on Amorim to take swift action this summer, comparing the situation to how Mikel Arteta has played a big role in the overhaul at Arsenal in recent years.",
      "\"Someone's got to get a grip of that club, and I think it has to be the manager. Ruben, you've got to get a grip of that club,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Mikel Arteta's done a great job at Arsenal. From day one, he imprinted his standards on the club, he put the coaching systems in place, there's been progression all the way through, and he's got five years now under his belt, six years under his belt.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim needs to look at next season, how he gets into the top six, how he basically wipes half that squad out, how he transforms it into a dynamic team that plays exciting football from the rigid stuff that we're currently watching, and he needs to think about which players in that dressing room can do a job for him.",
      "\"Because if the players are starting to question their own belonging in that dressing room, you've got a huge problem.\""
