      "With European football off the table and one Premier League game remaining, the season is all but over for Manchester United. The 16th-placed team in England can still have a say on Champions League qualification but only by denting Aston Villa's hopes with a positive result at Old Trafford.",
      "It is little wonder that United's focus is now on the transfer window. The intense scrutiny placed upon the club is only set to increase amid the news the Red Devils will listen to offers for any of their current players.",
      "A busy summer awaits with the club appearing to need to overhaul their squad to improve upon a dismal season and to prepare the team for Ruben Amorim's first pre-season in charge of the club. United will hope to earn significant fees from the likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony as they attempt to replenish their funds.",
      "The club have been widely linked to signing a new striker, with the likes of Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap linked to the club. But that alone will not fix Amorim's issues.",
      "Ruben Amorim still hopes to strengthen his squad this summer and has made his desires clear ahead of the transfer window opening. Despite an impending firesale, Amorim's focus remains on improving his squad after a difficult start to life in England.",
      "The 40-year-old Portuguese coach wants to see an improvement in midfield and wants the club to target players who will add pace, power and athleticism, per ESPN. Amorim has previously highlighted the physical demands of the Premier League as causing his side issues.",
      "Barcelona sporting director Deco has admitted the La Liga giants are interested in both Manchester United 's Marcus Rashford and Liverpool star Luis Diaz this summer. The Catalan club have long been linked with Rashford who is poised to depart Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Rashford is understood to prefer a move to Barcelona ahead of a transfer to Aston Villa, where he has been on loan, or another Premier League rival. United will hope to bring in a fee for the forward who fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"We like Luis, we like Rashford, and we like other players,\" Deco told Catalan radio station RAC 1. \"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",
      "Manchester United will confirm the transfer of Matheus Cunha 'soon' according to reports. The Red Devils are set to trigger the Wolves star's £625m release clause to bring the Brazilian to the club, with United's failure to qualify for Europe said to have no impacted the deal.",
      "It is claimed the transfer is already 'wrapped up' and will soon be announced. The transfer window opens on June 1 and will remain opn until June 10 for Premier League clubs before re-opening on June 16."

But United fell to a chastening 1-0 loss on the night, meaning they will end the campaign without a trophy and miss out on qualification for next year's Champions League.",
      "Tottenham have also struggled domestically this season but were not overly troubled by United, who succumbed to a scruffy Brennan Johnson goal towards the end of the first half.",
      "And it's now emerged per a new report from ESPN that Amorim headed to Bilbao with concerns over his team's ability to compete physically in key areas of the pitch.",
      "It's claimed that United's head coach was worried his player would struggle with their opponents and that proved to be the case in midfield and attack, with Rasmus Hojlund struggling to get much change out of Cristian Romero and Micky van der Ven.",
      "Victory for Ange Postecoglou's side means United will not only miss out on European football completely for just the second time in 35 years but also the prospect of having to revise their summer transfer plans.",
      "The riches of Champions League football would have provided Manchester United with a timely £100 million boost which would have significantly aided Amorim in his bid to rebuild.",
      "He has, however, been told that the club will back him the transfer market with the Red Devils still expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in Matheus Cunha's contract.",
      "As well as wrapping up a deal for the Wolves forward, United are also admirers of Liam Delap. The striker will leave Ipswich Town following their relegation from the Premier League and is available for just £30m due to a release clause of his own."

      "McTominay, who has become a hero in Naples ever since joining Napoli from United last summer, opened the scoring with a superb acrobatic effort from a Matteo Politano cross shortly before half-time to send the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona wild.",
      "The goal was McTominay's 13th of a stellar debut season in Italian football, with the Scottish international scoring six in the final seven games of the campaign to help propel his side over the line.",
      "Napoli, who also feature McTominay's Scotland team-mate Billy Gilmour in midfield, then went 2-0 up early in the second half when Lukaku picked up Amir Rrahmani's pass, burst past the former Everton defender Yerry Mina and fired home his 14th goal of the season to spark wild scenes.",
      "The victory marks Napoli's second Serie A title in the past three seasons, having previously won just two titles in their entire history - in 1986-87 and 1989-90, both of which were powered by Maradona.",
      "Champions League finalists Inter were in action at Cesc Fabregas' Como, where the former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina, 42, was sent off shortly before half-time in the final appearance of his long career.",
      "Como were already a goal down at that point courtesy of a header from defender Stefan de Vrij, with Joaquin Correa adding a second at the start of the second half, at almost exactly the same time Lukaku scored Napoli's second.",

      "But Napoli avoided the need for that with their victory, with McTominay and Lukaku's success coming just two days after former club United lost 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "McTominay came through the ranks at United and played 255 times for the Red Devils before he was deemed surplus to requirements last summer, when he joined Napoli for £25.7million.",
      "United signed Lukaku from Everton in the summer of 2017 for £75m plus £15m in add-ons, but he was to last just two seasons in Manchester after scoring 42 goals in 96 games before joining Inter in 2019."

      "\"And football sometimes is like this. I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days.",

      "According to a report from the Daily Mail, Al-Hilal are interested in signing the midfielder and are ready to offer United around £100m for their talisman. The report adds that a three-year deal worth £700,000-a-week and up to £65m-a-year in add-ons is on the table.",

      "The 27-year-old is set to enter the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park and his form has attracted the interest of United, who have struggled for goals this season. Frontline strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have managed just seven Premier League goals between them.",

And now I am a manager myself, albeit at a much lower level, I have a better understanding of the slings and arrows of the job. But he has won only six league games in six months and I’m sorry: You can’t be that bad as a Manchester United manager.",

      "Good for Big Ange that he was prepared to adapt his tactics in such a big game, and he reaped the rewards. If the board stick with Amorim - and I would never advocate a manager getting the sack - they must sanction signings this summer who will fit his sacrosanct system.",
      "But history suggests you don’t win the Premier League playing with a back three. I can only think of Antonio Conte’s Chelsea team, in 2017, winning the title with three centre-backs and wing-backs.",
      "It’s a massive decision, because United cannot offer prospective new players European football next season and the league table doesn’t lie.",
      "Manchester United are now a bang average, lower mid-table side. And the architects of this sorry state of affairs need to look at themselves before they consider the manager’s position."

Four years on, United are on track for their worst-ever finish in the Premier League - just two places above the relegation zone - without any European football next season and a squad desperately in need of revamping.",
      "Ronaldo made his sensational return to Old Trafford on transfer deadline day in August 2021, signing from Juventus for a fee of £12.86million. The return of the Portuguese legend, who had previously won a Ballon d'Or and three Premier League titles with the club, was greeted with great enthusiasm and hope.",
      "The Red Devils had just ended the previous season as runners-up under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and had already made exciting additions like Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane to the squad earlier that summer.",
      "The plan was that by adding one of the greatest goal-scorers of all time to their ranks, United would return to their glory days and secure their first league triumph since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013.",
      "As per The Sun, Ronaldo showed his winning mentality even before setting foot at United. He is said to have spoken to his Portugal team-mate Fernandes, instructing the midfielder to tell the rest of the United squad that they needed to have faith in themselves and win the title that year.",
      "For a multitude of reasons, the Red Devils under Ralf Rangnick finished the season in sixth place, 35 points behind champions Manchester City. Ronaldo's contract would be ripped up by the end of 2022 after being frozen out by Rangnick's successor, Erik ten Hag.",
      "The now 40-year-old then completed a stunning transfer to Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr, setting a trend for other ageing Premier League stars. Ten Hag's decision to part ways with the veteran forward was seemingly justified as he steered United back to a respectable third-place finish in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "However, since then, United have repeatedly hit new lows. A combination of poor recruitment and a mishmash of managers with differing philosophies has inflicted long-term damage on the club. And despite lifting the FA Cup in 2024, Ten Hag couldn't keep the sinking ship afloat and was sacked last October.",
      "Ruben Amorim, a fresh-faced and tactically innovative manager, fresh off winning the league with Portuguese side Sporting CP, was brought in soon after. But under the once jovial Portuguese head coach, the Red Devils have again set new unwanted records.",
      "Amorim has the distinction of having fewer points per game than any other United manager in the Premier League era, while also overseeing the most defeats, fewest victories and the lowest league tally in recent memory. The only silver lining was if he could have ended a disastrous season with some silverware and secured a Champions League spot by defeating Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "As it transpired, United's two biggest weaknesses - their blunt attack and error-prone goalkeeper - would result in them losing 1-0 to Spurs, who had not won a trophy in 17 years prior to Wednesday night. Any sliver of optimism vanished in Bilbao, and it was unclear how things could get any worse.",
      "That was, until, club captain Fernandes astonishingly offered to quit the club in his post-match interview. The 30-year-old, with at least two years still left on his contract, announced he is willing to leave if United bosses wish to cash in on him.",

      "Gareth Bale watched on with a smile as his old club Tottenham Hotspur lifted their first trophy in 17 years after defeating Manchester United. But the Welshman's story could have been very different had he not turned down the chance to join the Red Devils over the north London side.",
      "Almost two decades ago, a young Bale was catching eyes from full-back, scoring five goals and assisting 12 times across 45 appearances for then-Championship side Southampton. New Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was interested, but he faced stiff competition from Premier League giant Sir Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United boardroom.",
      "Bale decided to turn down Ferguson, though, and head to north London in 2007 instead, telling his Airwayz channel in 2023 that this decision actually led to his success rather than any potential downfall.",
      "The 35-year-old said: \"I rejected Manchester United and went to Tottenham. At that time, United were the biggest team in the league, they were winning trophies, they had the biggest players, the best manager.",
      "\"The easiest decision would be to go to Man United and the biggest club. You always want to be at the biggest clubs but I took the approach that I wanted to be playing first-team football.\"",
      "But Bale bucked the trend; he chose Spurs and spent six seasons carving out a move from left-back to creative forward, scoring 42 goals in 142 appearances and impressing throughout his time in the Premier League.",
      "From there, the Welshman carved out a sensational transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2013 for a then-world record fee of £85million. He joined superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel Di Maria, Karim Benzema, Sergio Ramos, Casemiro and Luka Modric in the famous white kit, and spent nine seasons with the club.",
      "In this time, Bale scored 106 goals in 258 appearances, winning five Champions Leagues, three La Liga titles and a host of other honours. The attacker spent one season back on loan to Spurs, before joining Los Angeles FC and retiring in 2023 as one of the greatest players in both Welsh and footballing history.",
      "So while many would assume Bale would regret the decision to snub Ferguson and his Red Devils – who won the Premier League title under Sir Alex in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013 – for Spurs, the retired winger insisted that a need for consistent game time at a young age was more important to him than money and glory.",
      "He added: \"At that age, a lot of players would go for the money and would want to go to a bigger club.",
      "\"But I was playing, developing and learning. It was an important part of my development to keep playing first-team football because you can't replicate that.\"",
      "Now, it seems that Bale will have the last laugh over the team that could've been but wasn't, as he made a sly joke at United's expense following their damaging European defeat this week.",
      "During TNT Sport's broadcast of Spurs' 1-0 Europa League final win, Bale was questioned on whether this win will get rid of the 'Spursy' tagline that the club are serial losers.",
      "He was quick to respond at United's woes, as he said: \"It could be a United-y thing now, I am telling you. But it gets rid of that stigma now for sure, and hopefully we can build on it.\"",

      "Given that Garnacho was subject to bids from Chelsea and Napoli in the January transfer window, his future certainly doesn't seem settled, and his comments after Wednesday's final only added fuel to the fire.",
      "After coming on with just 20 minutes to go in Bilbao, the disgruntled winger not only questioned Ruben Amorim's decision to bench him in favour of Mason Mount but admitted he's not sure where his future lies beyond this season. \"Up until the final, I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" said Garnacho.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision], but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "The Argentine's brother, Roberto Garnacho, took to Instagram to display his anger at the forward's minimal contribution in the final, claiming he was \"thrown under the bus\".",
      "\"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus,\" wrote the United star's sibling.",
      "In the aftermath of the game, The Telegraph reported that the Premier League club may accept a bid of £60m for Garnacho, which could open the path for Amorim to reunite with Gyokeres for the same figure despite his release clause reported to be £83.6m.",
      "Leading Sporting CP to a second straight league title, the Sweden international has scored a whopping 53 goals in all competitions this season, making it 96 goals in just 101 games in his two seasons in Portugal.",
      "The 26-year-old has also been routinely linked with a transfer to Arsenal or Juventus, but despite the intense speculation surrounding his next move, his uncle says he could stay put in Portugal.",
      "Asked by Record whether the striker could continue his story in Lisbon, Chris Gyokeres said of his nephew: \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay. Yes, we think so. We hope so, because look… we love it, it's incredible, the country, the people and Sporting. And the Lions. We love it!\""

      "Viktor Gyokeres insists there are \"no hard feelings\" towards Ruben Amorim following his surprising mid-season exit from Sporting CP to Manchester United. Gyokeres has been sensational for the Portuguese side, scoring 53 goals and providing 13 assists in all competitions, including 39 strikes in the league alone.",
      "The Swede played a vital role in helping Sporting secure back-to-back league titles as he scooped the top scorer award for the second successive season. United are said to be vying for the striker's services, but they face tough competition, as reports suggest Arsenal are currently leading the chase for his signature.",
      "The bond between Gyokeres and his ex-boss Amorim may well influence the striker's decision, however, potentially luring him away from other clubs and towards a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "In an interview with SIC, the 26-year-old revealed his team's disappointment following Amorim's sudden exit but insisted there were no grudges regarding his decision to swap Jose Alvalade for Old Trafford.",
      "Gyokeres said: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Before Amorim's departure, Sporting had embarked on an unbeaten streak domestically, claiming victory in each league match before he left in November.",
      "Reflecting upon the winning mentality set by the Portuguese manager, Gyokeres admitted he felt invincible under Amorim. \"I think when you're in that kind of moment where you keep winning, you go in with the same mentality as every game and you keep doing the same things and with the same rhythm,\" he added.",
      "\"That's what we felt when we went into the games. It's possible to have those kinds of moments, I don't know if we would have kept the same level throughout the season, because I think it's very normal in football for there to be stages of the season when you maybe win every game and then there's a period when it's tougher.",
      "\"Of course, we always have the mentality of wanting to win every game, but as we've seen in football, it doesn't always end that way. I think it's very difficult to go through an entire season without losing a single game, as you can see in history, I don't think many teams have done it. It's one thing to win a lot of games and another thing to go a whole season without losing a game.\"",
      "If United were to pursue Gyokeres this summer, the transfer fee would not be too expensive. A gentleman's agreement in the Swede's contract would allow him to leave for a fee of between £55million and £60m, significantly less than his £84.3m release clause.",
      "However, United's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final may jeopardise Amorim's plans to reunite with his former forward.",
      "The 1-0 loss to Spurs means that the Red Devils will not participate in European football in the 2025/26 season, making other clubs more attractive.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres has been non-committal about his plans for the summer. The sought-after striker is expected to leave for the Premier League but hasn't completely ruled out staying put.",
      "\"Hopefully, you can expect that I will keep improving and score goals,\" he said. \"In Portugal? Let's see, it's the future, and it's football as well, so you never know what's going to happen. As you've seen this season, you never know what's going to happen, and it's the same now.

      "Less than a year after being released by Manchester United, Brandon Williams has been sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for two years. And after recently saying it hurt him to watch football, the full back who had been tipped for the very top finds his career in tatters.",
      "Williams, 24, pleaded guilty to driving dangerously, with a balloon in his mouth, and hitting a top speed of 99mph before crashing his Audi A3 into a Ford Fiesta on the A34 near Handforth, Cheshire in August 2023.",
      "And on Friday he was handed a suspended 14-month prison sentence, 180 hours of community service and banned from driving for 30 months. This was not Williams’ first driving offence – he had already accumulated 30 points on his licence – but the damage caused remains untold.",
      "And although he avoided prison, there remains serious doubts over whether a player once so highly rated, has a future in the game - having not played a game for 12 months.",
      "Rare is the player who can return from such a long spell out of the game to hit the heights of before. And it is hard to predict whether clubs will eventually be willing to take a punt on someone with undoubted talent but too many red marks to his name.",
      "Williams joined United’s academy aged eight and made his first-team breakthrough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer while still a teenager in a Europa League draw away to AZ Alkmaar.",
      "And after an otherwise forgettable scoreless encounter Solskjaer was more than enthused by the left back’s bow. “You won’t see a better full debut from a full back anywhere,” Solskjaer said. “The boy is just going to improve and improve. He’s got the right mentality.”",
      "Plenty more opportunities followed with Williams finishing the 2019-20 season by making 36 appearances across all competitions. “He's been fantastic the few games he's played,” Solskjaer said later in that debut campaign. “The boy has no fear, he is as brave as a lion and he got us the win.”",
      "But as Williams recently said on the More Than A Match podcast, he found life “went from 0-100 real quick and that’s what people will never understand.”",
      "The pandemic affected him. While his team-mates were living in their gated mansions, he found life difficult living in a bedroom at his mum’s house. But the lockdown summer brought a four-year deal worth more than £50,000 per and external expectations were that he would kick on.",
      "There would be no regular starting spot during 2020-21 and he was sent on loan to Norwich City the following year.",
      "At Carrow Road, Williams featured semi-regularly as they were relegated to the Championship - and briefly landed himself in hot water because of an Instagram post apparently directed at Canaries fans who he claimed followed him home after a defeat to West Ham.",
      "He returned to Old Trafford in the summer of 2022 but could not find a way into new head coach Erik ten Hag’s plans and found the attention from those in his outer circle was proving a distraction.",
      "With game time limited, the window for off-field distractions grew bigger. “It was difficult,” he added to More Than A Match. “You had family members you didn’t know was (sic) your family, friends you didn’t know was your mates.”",
      "Another loan, to Ipswich Town at the start of last season, brought a clean slate and the initial signs were promising. Except the Cheshire crash came a few days before. “At that point, I was in a bad situation, stuff was going on,” Williams said on the same podcast. He required hospital treatment before he was arrested and breathalysed but tests for drugs and alcohol were negative.",
      "Recorder Eric Lamb acknowledged that Williams had 'strong personal mitigation' after committing the offence at a time of depression.",
      "Still, prosecutors said that Williams - who had previously received driving bans of six months in October 2023 and 12 months in May 2024 - it was fortunate no one was killed from his “erratic driving.”",
      "Andrew Madden, senior Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor, said Williams' driving \"clearly fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver.” Mr Madden added: \"Witnesses said Williams kept speeding up and then braking sharply. It was clear he wasn't in control of the vehicle. The driving was erratic and the speed was grossly excessive. Eventually, Williams lost control completely and crashed.\"",
      "Now the career of a player that Manchester United had the highest hopes for is under serious doubt.",
      "Williams himself has suggested that continuing his playing career away from the glaring lights of the Premier League may be his best option. He said: \"I've had loads of teams trying to get me out - America, Europe and England - but I haven't been ready. I want to go somewhere 100% focused and kick on.",
      "\"I would like to experience that different culture. I'm only 24 so I could do three or four years abroad. Definitely Europe at a good club or an upcoming club.\"",

Fresh off the back of winning Liga Portugal in 2023/24 and in the midst of another title charge, the 40-year-old accepted the vacant Red Devils job after Erik ten Hag’s sacking.",

The 25-year-old recently recalled how he openly expressed his bitter disappointment in front of his team-mates and Amorim, though it didn’t sway the manager’s decision.",
      "Hjulmand told A Bola: \"We thought that Amorim would stay for the season and fight to also be a two-time champion. Many players wanted to stay at Sporting with Ruben Amorim, because he is a great coach.”",
      "When asked whether he felt betrayed, the Denmark international replied: “That’s a very strong word. We feel disappointed with his departure. We were on a run of 11 consecutive wins, doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "“Everything was very clear to everyone on the pitch. It was almost as if we were playing Playstation. Everyone knew what they had to do.",
      "“I told him in front of the other players that we were disappointed with his departure. We were counting on him to help us all fight for the second title.",

      "Amorim revealed after his United move was announced that he had originally planned to leave Sporting at the end of the current 2024/25 season. Yet, he was informed that the offer from United wouldn't still be available come May.",
      "Speaking at the time of the United announcement, the Portuguese said: “We started very well this season and then Manchester United came in for me. They paid above the amount set for my release clause and the president of Sporting CP defended the club's interests.",
      "“I never argued about anything with the president regarding the negotiations. The only thing I asked during the process was that it take place at the end of the season.",
      "“I spent three days asking for this, but I was told it wasn’t possible. It was now or never, otherwise they would look for another option. I had three days to decide something that radically changes my life.”",
      "Amorim added: “I have to take steps forward in my career and it was harder for me than any other Sportinguista to leave. I knew that if I rejected Manchester United, in seven months' time I wouldn’t have that option available, and I knew that at the end of the season I was going to leave Sporting CP.",
      "“I could have felt a sense of regret that would be difficult to deal with. Between the disappointment of all Sportinguistas and taking risks in my career, or waiting for the end of the season and not having the only club that I wanted to join as an option, I had to decide. So I decided.”",
      "It’s unclear whether Amorim regrets that decision almost seven months on, having experienced an agonising first season at Old Trafford. During his tenure, United have consistently set new records for lows as the head coach struggles to impart his philosophy at the already-ailing club.",
      "With United ending the campaign just above the relegation zone and fresh off a disastrous Europa League final loss which ruled out European football next season, Amorim has made it clear that he is open to leaving this summer if club bosses and fans decide he is the wrong man for the job.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has laid out three deemands to club chiefs for the transfer market this summer. The Red Devils are tasked with improving their squad after a disastrous season, and have already made their entire squad available for sale.",
      "United's defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final ensured they missed out on European football and failed to land the £100million boost a place in the Champions League would have offered. They also find themselves in 16th in the Premier League, consigned to their worst-ever season in the division.",
      "Despite an impending firesale, Amorim's focus remains on improving his squad. The 40-year-old coach wants the club to target players who will add pace, power and athleticism to his midfield, per ESPN.",
      "United have already been linked to a number of forwards ahead of the summer, including Liam Delap, Matheus Cunha and Victor Osimhen. But Amorim wants to overcome another weakness he has identified since joining the club.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has previously discussed his side's struggle to compete with the physicality present in the Premier League, in comparison to Europe. The United boss suggested that is why Antony is doing well in La Liga with Real Betis.",
      "\"The physical aspect is there [in the Premier League], no matter who the opponent is. Sometimes they don't need to build, just a long ball, second ball and that's it,\" Amorim said earlier this season.",
      "\"If you don't have that, you have difficulties. We talk about some players like Antony who is much better in Spain, there are many factors, but I guarantee you it's linked to the physical aspect.\"",
      "Former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher has warned United over adhering to Amorim's desires this summer however. The Premier League pundit believes that would see the club shaped specifically to the former Sporting boss' system which is unlikely to suit any potential replacement.",
      "\"With Amorim, you are not just committing to an individual coach,\" said Carragher. \"It means spending big on redesigning the squad to meet Amorim’s specific needs in the knowledge that, if he underperforms again next season, his successor will most likely revert to a flat back four.",
      "\"Given the precariousness of United’s finances, which Ratcliffe acknowledged earlier this season, can the club really afford any more expensive mistakes? Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.\""

      "Jamie Carragher has urged Manchester United to part ways with Ruben Amorim this summer. Amorim has endured a dismal reign since replacing Erik ten Hag in November, winning just 16 of his 41 games in charge.",
      "The latest low point came on Wednesday night when United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham. The Red Devils were unable to break down Ange Postecoglou's side, with Brennan Johnson's first-half goal proving to be the difference.",
      "Amorim had been hoping to use this summer's transfer window to overhaul United's squad. That will likely prove to be incredibly difficult, with funding for new signings hard to raise with no European football.",
      "That situation has convinced Carragher that it would be best if Amorim and United parted ways. The Liverpool legend believes that the Red Devils may even have appointed the wrong man back in November.",
      "\"At some point during their post-season review of a dire campaign, someone in the Manchester United boardroom will need the courage to ask the toughest question: 'Did we appoint the wrong manager at the wrong time?'\" Carragher told The Telegraph.",
      "\"With Amorim, you are not just committing to an individual coach. It means spending big on redesigning the squad to meet Amorim’s specific needs in the knowledge that, if he underperforms again next season, his successor will most likely revert to a flat back four.",
      "\"Given the precariousness of United’s finances, which Ratcliffe acknowledged earlier this season, can the club really afford any more expensive mistakes? Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.\"",
      "Amorim himself has admitted he would be happy to leave without compensation should the board decide he is not the right man for the job. The 40-year-old insisted his side had played well in the final and called for faith from club bosses.",
      "\"It's in the future, I'm not going to talk about the future. This loss, the pain of losing this match. I can see it was clear, we were the better team but then we managed not to score again, so it's very hard to win football matches,\" he said.",
      "\"But the guys tried everything to win the game. In the future, we will have time to assess everything. We have to see. We have to see. I know everything that you did [say], I said before you. In this moment, I’m not going to be here defending myself. It’s not my style.",
      "\"In this moment it’s a little bit of faith, so let’s see. If the board and the fans feel I’m not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation, but I will not quite.",
      "\"Again, I’m really confident about my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things. I think I was always really honest with you guys. We didn’t perform perfect today, but we were better than the opponent, and the opponent also played.\""

      "United sources say the majority of the 200 staff members expected to lose their jobs in the latest round of cuts had already been informed of their at-risk status.",
      "But some football staff were only told of their fate on Friday, with a desire to avoid disruption during the run to the Europa League final and the build-up to Wednesday's final against Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "With that game now out of the way and just the final Premier League game of the season to come, staff affected in football-facing areas are being informed of their fate, with some told their job roles are being phased out and that they won't be remaining at the club.",
      "The development is another blow to morale at Carrington, with the news delivered so soon after the 1-0 defeat at Spurs which means United miss out on Champions League football next term, leaving a £100million hole in the budget. United have lost more than £370million over the past five years.",
      "The latest redundancies aren't related to the defeat and had been planned as part of the cutback of 150 to 200 jobs. Those redundancies follow on from 250 staff being made redundant a year ago.",
      "United employed around 1,100 people when Ineos took control of the club's football operations in February 2024, but that workforce is now expected to be slashed to around 650 employees.

      "If only Victor Thorp had cut his toenails that April Sunday morning. If Thorp was onside in the 120th minute at Wembley, he would have consigned Manchester United to one of their most ignominious defeats to second-tier Coventry City. It would have been sacked in the evening, rather than the morning for Erik ten Hag.",
      "United's season would have ended trophyless. Instead, it ended gloriously, and the game is about glory. No United fan at Wembley in May last year will forget their day in the sun.",
      "But the club's 13th FA Cup triumph was detrimental in the long run. Sir Jim Ratcliffe lost his nerve, kept Ten Hag and United have lost 18 Premier League games already this season. They are assured of a schedule devoid of jaunts across the continent next season.",
      "United's wallets will be hit. There will be a derisory merit payment for what could be a 17th-place finish in the Premier League, no European revenue, no matchday revenue in the Champions League and a penalty clause invoked in the Adidas deal. Roughly, that is an £80million black hole.",
      "They have squandered nearly £15m keeping Erik ten Hag and then hiring and firing Dan Ashworth. There is also the £200m they largely misspent on players in Ten Hag's last transfer window.",
      "2019 was the year of the 'cultural reset' at United. Reset, revamp or reboot, none of those words do United's current position justice. Without relegation (never a tangible threat), they are at rock bottom.",
      "They have to frame next season positively. Free midweeks for Ruben Amorim to coach the players to within an inch of their lives, ample rest between matches and the motivation to ensure United do not end up anywhere near to where they are now.",
      "Here is a five-point plan to make United a force again:",
      "More proactivism, less pragmatism",
      "Amorim has agonised over whether to play pragmatically or proactively. In Bilbao, he did neither. Alejandro Garnacho was benched as Mason Mount retained the faith of a coach who \"loves\" him yet overlooked the fact that the playmaker is not as much of a goal threat as Garnacho. And United did not score for the 16th time.",
      "One of the accusations levelled at Mount is he does little with the ball. Amorim bristled at the suggestion he had got it wrong by starting Mount, reminding this correspondent that Garnacho missed a one-on-one in the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao, a match Mount emerged in to end the Spanish side's chances of a comeback.",
      "Mount's fleeting purple patch consisted of three goals in two games and he did not play 90 minutes in either. Garnacho had started 14 successive games until his 'rest' for the defeat against West Ham. That he remained on the bench at Chelsea five days later was significant.",
      "Had Leny Yoro not recovered from a foot injury, Amorim would have started the same side that lost at Chelsea. United were competitive for around an hour at Stamford Bridge when matches last for 90 minutes. They managed one attempt on target. Garnacho forced Guglielmo Vicario to dive down to his left within minutes of his belated arrival on Wednesday night.",
      "United also had glaring issues in midfield against Spurs: full backs as wingers. Noussair Mazraoui admitted last week he is more settled as a right centre back as it is the closest position to playing at right back. Mazraoui is not an attack-minded winger and United offered no threat down Tottenham's left-hand side when they ought to have doubled up on the shaky Destiny Udogie.",
      "Bruno Fernandes seemed to have been reinvented as a central midfielder before the March internationals. Then he moved forward again when United's season resumed at Nottingham Forest. Suddenly, he was back in midfield for the dress rehearsal at Chelsea. Amorim maybe wanted some finesse in midfield against the conservative trio of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr but Fernandes, United's top scorer, had to be in the front three for the final.",
      "Mazraoui should be considered a centre half from next season and United need an upgrade on the right wing. Amorim played wingers in the 3-4-2-1 system at Sporting yet has settled on full backs at United. The ends have not justified the means yet United have already invested £25million in the Danish left back Patrick Dorgu, who started by default in Bilbao.",
      "Compromise with youngsters",
      "Garnacho is becoming a problem for United. Like Marcus Rashford before him, he has developed an inflated air of entitlement and it should startle United that a 20-year-old brazenly sounded off about a \"s**t\" season, criticised the manager's decision to drop him and cast doubt on his future. His gobby brother had also joined in online.",
      "The authority of the United manager's role should always be protected but Garnacho is a nuanced case. There has been a willingness from the player and coach to make it work since he was dropped from the Manchester derby squad on December 15 and Amorim has enthused about the adjustments Garnacho has made to his game.",
      "Garnacho remains one of a handful of fan favourites. He was serenaded when he warmed up at San Mames and there was a bullish roar when he was ordered back to come on. He was seen as such an ally of Amorim's he flanked him for the pre-match press conference for the semi-final second leg against Athletic.",
      "United are renowned for wingers and Garnacho is one of the academy's biggest success stories this century. Only Garnacho jars with Amorim's system and a new number 10, Matheus Cunha, is expected to occupy one of those two roles behind the striker.",
      "There has been interest in Garnacho and there is an obvious temptation for United to cash in. He would represent pure profit, you can't tolerate any player publicly questioning the manager and he does not naturally fit into the system.",
      "Napoli, on the verge of a fourth Scudetto, wanted Garnacho in January and deemed him worthy of replacing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Antonio Conte, the Napoli coach, oversaw one of Eden Hazard's greatest seasons at Chelsea. Those are ringing endorsements United should be wary of.",
      "All parties need to sit around a table, thrash out their differences and seek a compromise. That also applies to Kobbie Mainoo, the poster boy of United's future as recently as the start of this season but no longer a regular. Amorim has misgivings about Mainoo as a midfielder and has trialled him as a playmaker and a striker with mixed results.",
      "It would be beyond bold for United to cash in on Mainoo and/or Garnacho when it is not a stretch to imagine them requiring a new manager in the autumn. United can improve with Amorim, Garnacho and Mainoo all on the bus, despite Garnacho's brother claiming he was thrown under it.",
      "Recruit for the club, not the manager",
      "If United fans were given the choice between Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres the majority would opt for the latter. Gyokeres is older and more proven, albeit in a much weaker league, and United know all-too-well the pitfalls of stockpiling players schooled outside one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Gyokeres would be a legitimate exception, yet United have settled on Delap. The dynamic suddenly shifts as the scrutiny would be on Jason Wilcox, rather than Amorim. Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed Wilcox possesses \"the best eyes in football\" and he has not looked far for United's next starting striker, having watched Delap develop at City when he was the head of their academy.",
      "United's recruitment will be severely impacted by the absence of European football from their schedule next season. Cunha and Delap are attainable through release clauses. That feels like a cop-out with Delap, only four days younger than the dismal Rasmus Hojlund. They have a -12 goal difference. They cannot cut corners with the striker's role.",
      "Last year, United operated by a one for the manager, one for the board policy. Ten Hag reunited with Ajax alumni but also integrated two signings from the French league with no links to Dutch football. Leny Yoro should have ushered in a very different recruitment era at United, only their next arrival was the Dutchman Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The mid-season signings of Dorgu and Ayden Heaven have offered a glimpse of what could come this summer and beyond. But the worst United side in 51 years needs proven commodities, particularly if Bruno Fernandes heads for the Riyadh retirement home.",
      "Expendable culture",
      "United are bound to be saddled with some immovable players. Luke Shaw was raw in the San Mames mixed zone, questioning if he is good enough. We all know the answer and he should, too. He is not going to put his own contract through the shredder two years before its expiry date.",
      "Nobody should be off-limits if United receive an acceptable offer. How could they be after a season like this one? That applies to Garnacho and Mainoo. If they want a change of scenery then that is the clincher.",
      "Jose Mourinho was standing in the doorway when he spoke to some of us in San Jose in 2018 and said he would not stand in the way of Anthony Martial, who wanted to leave. But Ed Woodward did. Ratcliffe was still cursing Woodward's methods as recently as March. United have let innumerable players outstay their welcome and Martial was one of them. Shaw is another. Victor Lindelof, too.",
      "The profitability and sustainability rules have influenced the length of contracts but United have got to stop doling out five-year deals like a volunteer with leaflets on Deansgate. Shorter contracts would keep players on their toes. Amorim's deal only has two years left to run and he will be judged much sooner than 2027.",
      "A new fall-guy at hierarchical level",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford sunk his claws into Ratcliffe a while ago and Ratcliffe is quite taken by him. Two years after the Ineos delegation visited Old Trafford, nobody has given a satisfactory explanation for Brailsford's presence on the United football board.",
      "Brailsford has admitted he is \"no expert in football\". You can see that from United's results since he started to have input on their performance. Brailsford was an ally of Ashworth's. United spent longer courting Ashworth than the five months he lasted at United.",
      "Ratcliffe should send Brailsford on his bike. That would show Ineos are serious about arresting United's staggering decline."

      "But those two plans should cover departures as well as arrivals, and with no European football next season, Ineos can now take a bludgeon to this squad. United could have 31 first-team squad members when players return for pre-season and in a campaign that could be as short as 40 games, that is wildly excessive.",
      "A 25-man squad for next season would be fine, but only if that included some of the club's promising youngsters who are on the fringes of the first team. Any bigger, and there will be senior players barely getting a kick, and the dynamic at training will be difficult to manage for Ruben Amorim, who is desperate to make the most of those free weeks at Carrington.",
      "Some of the departures are straightforward. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are out of contract and will leave next month. Tyrell Malacia, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all out on loan and will be sold in the summer. That is seven players going already.",
      "Then are the potential sales. Change looks certain in the goalkeeping department, and Altay Bayindir should be sold for an upgrade to offer more competition to Andre Onana.",
      "The departures of Evans and Lindelof free up space in defence for Ayden Heaven, and no further sales are really required here, although the wing-back situation is one to monitor. Diogo Dalot needs competition on the right, and having Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass on the left looks light, but there might be no other option.",
      "Sales should be considered in midfield. The failure to qualify for the Champions League makes Casemiro's role redundant next season. He is a European specialist who has struggled in the Premier League, and Ineos desperately need shot of the club's highest earner. Manuel Ugarte doesn't look up to the job yet, but will get another season. Toby Collyer turns 22 in January and either needs more games or to be sold as well, as there are a crop of promising midfielders in the academy waiting for their chance.",
      "In attack, selling or at least loaning one of Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund looks essential. Neither are up to the job, but Zirkzee has probably shown more promise. He is less of a natural fit as a No. 9 for Amorim, but his versatility to play behind a striker is beneficial. If Amorim keeps Chido Obi in the first-team picture, he is another option at centre-forward.",
      "Then there are the two most controversial possible departures. Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho would have both been frustrated at their roles in the Europa League final and it's clear Amorim is yet to fully trust either. As academy graduates, they represent pure profit in the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) and are sellable assets.",
      "A departure for either would go down badly amongst supporters, but neither is in Amorim's strongest team, and it would be a major financial boost. Without the guarantee of what would have been at least 10 extra fixtures in the Champions League, keeping both of them happy might be a challenge as well.",
      "That is the context with which United must approach this summer. Defeat in Bilbao means they have to be ruthless when it comes to trimming the size of this squad."

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, May 23.",
      "The dust is beginning to settle on the disappointing Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and with the final match of the Premier League campaign this Sunday, attention is beginning to turn to the summer. United will be eyeing a major rebuild in the transfer window and which players stay, go or arrive will be interesting to see.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho looks more likely to leave than stay at the present moment following his outspoken comments after the Europa League final. Napoli had a bid rejected for his services in the January transfer window.",
      "Elsewhere, Matheus Cunha is seen as a top target for United and the first deal which is likely to be completed this summer. The Wolverhampton Wanderers man has a £62.5m release clause.",

      "“Yes, he’s looking at his options for next year,” said McKenna at his press conference. “We support him with that.”",
      "The young striker is on Manchester United's radar amongst other Premier League clubs.",
      "ESPN say Alejandro Garnacho is 'increasingly likely' to leave Manchester United after making his feelings about the season extremely clear following the Europa League final, which he started on the bench.",
      "'Unhappy' with his role under Ruben Amorim and the Tottenham match, it is said his agent expects interest from the Premier League and Saudi Arabia.",
      "It is Sports Illustrated's belief that Ruben Amorim has been set a definitive transfer budget now that the Europa League is overwith.",
      "They say that the manager will have £100m to play with if he is going to rebuild areas of his squad for the 2025/26 campaign. Any additional funds must be raised through player sales.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Ruben Amorim has signed off his approval on Manchester United buying Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace.",
      "The FA Cup-winning midfielder is wanted for his 'pace, power and athleticism', as per ESPN's earlier report about players who will be targeted, but there is apparently going to be competition from Chelsea and Liverpool.",
      "He claims that the Man United captain's camp have been in touch and are waiting on an 'improved' offer, though what is already on the table is not far away from what is desired.",
      "Via The Express & Star, Wolves manager Vitor Pereira has remained coy this afternoon over which players of his will leave this summer amid Manchester United interest in forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"To be honest, I don't know the players that will leave. I'm waiting to understand, I really don't know. At home in front of our supporters is a good time to thank them for their support, they've helped us a lot,\" the told the press.",
      "It was added: \"We need to start work and get a clear picture on the squad. If we lose players with quality, we must replace them because we want to be better next season.\"",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, via Caught Offside, Delap has already held talks with both Chelsea and United about a possible summer transfer.",
      "The Blues could have the advantage over United due to their guaranteed European participation next season.",
      "However, it is also claimed that interest could be arriving from Germany for Delap with several 'important' Bundesliga clubs interested in the Englishman.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are looking to make Cunha their first transfer of the summer.",
      "With a £62.5m release clause in his contract that the Reds are willing to activate, a deal could be finalised quickly.",
      "Due to the Club World Cup, the transfer window opens briefly on June 1 so United could have Cunha officially in the building by then.",
      "In the January transfer window, United were linked with a move for Christopher Nkunku on loan as they looked to strengthen their attack.",
      "Obviously, that move never came to pass but Fabrizio Romano reports today that Nkunku remains guaranteed to leave Chelsea at the end of this season.",
      "Contact with the Frenchman is set to start soon and interested clubs have been lurking since January for him.",
      "Earlier this year, it was reported that Rashford saw a move to Barcelona as the dream heading into the summer transfer window.",
      "MEN Sport understands that while Villa have a £40m option to buy clause for Rashford in the summer, this does not mean that they have first refusal on the winger.",
      "Therefore, Rashford does have the option to explore a move to Barcelona before entering talks with Villa.",
      "Speaking on Catalan radio station RAC 1, as quoted by TEAMtalk, Barcelona sporting director Deco has confirmed that his club do have an interest in Rashford heading into the summer transfer window.",
      "The former Chelsea man explained:",
      "We like Luis [Diaz], we like Rashford, and we like other players. Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.",
      "According to ESPN, Amorim will demand that United look to bring in players that possess pace and strength in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed the Portuguese was fearful before the Europa League final that his team lacked these characteristics and this would ultimately cost them.",
      "Midfield is seen as a key are to improve after deals for Cunha and Delap are approved or otherwise.",
      "Despite Fernandes admitting that he will leave if United want him to in the summer, it appears there are no suggestions that the club want that to happen.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, Al Hilal see Fernandes as a priority for the summer transfer window and they would love to sign him before the Club World Cup kicks off next month.",
      "However, no direct approach to United has been made at this stage and, as far as the club sees it, they do not want to lose their captain.",
      "Amid interest from the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes has admitted that United may try to cash in on him in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed that Al Hilal would be willing to pay £120m for his services and if such a bid was to come in, United may find it difficult to reject it.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the full-time whistle in Bilbao, Fernandes said:",
      "I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go. I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.",
      "United have been reassured that the deal to sign Cunha will not be cancelled despite missing out on Champions League football next season.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano told GiveMeSport that the deal to sign the Wolves man is still set to go through soon.",
      "United already told Matheus Cunha that they are prepared to trigger the clause, so there will be no issues. And so I think it's going to be the first signing of the summer for United. And it's important to say that the player wanted this move, regardless of Champions League football or not, regardless of what happens in the Europa League final. Cunha wants to play for Manchester United, and my understanding is that he will play for Manchester United.",
      "I fear with him that we will end up selling him for £50m-£60m for PSR reasons, possibly this summer - it has been rumoured hasn't it. I fear he might go somewhere else, he might play in a 4-3-3 and he will end up scoring 25 or 30 goals for somebody. That is how good I think this lad could be. Shoehorn him into this system and I think it might be an issue because I am not sure he can play wing-back. I am not sure he is clever enough to be in that No.10 role, I am struggling to find a position for him in this system.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Napoli are prepping a bid to sign Garnacho this summer having missed out on him in January.",
      "United rejected an offer in the region of £40m this winter but could be more open to selling at the end of the season with more time available to find a replacement.",
      "It is believed the Italians are preparing a £50m package for Garnacho and while United want £60m, the two teams are not too far away in their negotiations.",
      "Before the Europa League final, Garnacho shared an image of himself scoring in the last final he played in - the FA Cup against Manchester City.",
      "After the final whistle in Bilbao and with just 20 minutes to his name on Wednesday night, he struck back in his post-match interview.",
      "Obviously, it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is a name that is expected to be talked about a lot during the summer transfer window.",
      "The winger was subject of interest from several clubs in the January window. Chelsea were among those to show an interest, along with Antonio Conte's Napoli. He, however, remained at Old Trafford and aimed to help the side turn their season around.",
      "That was no possible with United losing out to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday night. It means that next year will be a season without European football.",
      "It is expected to be a busy summer window at the club with several players expected to be available for transfer. One of those could be Garnacho, with the player himself now hinting that he may move on.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "Manchester United may have a relatively straightforward pathway to giving Ruben Amorim some of the signings he wants - and needs - this summer.",
      "United now face an uncertain future in the aftermath of their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final. Their 1-0 reverse in Bilbao confirmed that United will not be competing in Europe next season, missing out on qualification for the lucrative Champions League in the process.",
      "Amorim will now be preparing the United for their final Premier League fixture of the season, which will see them take on Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "After the final whistle on Sunday, attention will soon turn towards the upcoming summer transfer window and the business that United may conduct.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "Manchester United's 2024/25 season has been their worst in 51 years.",
      "After an abysmal Premier League campaign, which could end with them 17th, United fell at the final hurdle in the Europa League. Despite his side laying no punches onto Spurs, Amorim didn't change his team until the 71st minute with Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho coming on for the two players they probably should have started over in Rasmus Hojlund and Mount.",
      "Much has been made of Garnacho's snub. The winger has publicly come out and seemingly questioned the decision for him to only get 20 minutes while his brother has also criticised the handling of him in the final by Amorim.",
      "Read more here.",
      "TalkSPORT have provided an update on Liam Delap, with Newcastle United said to hold talks with Ipswich Town's in-demand striker 'this week.'",
      "In addition to United and Chelsea, Newcastle are thought to be one of the clubs who have shown interest in triggering the 22-year-old's £30million release clause. Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano says the striker is still 'exploring his options' after holding talks with Chelsea and United.",
      "In his Caught Offside column, Romano wrote: \"There is genuine interest from two very important clubs – Chelsea and Manchester United. Both clubs have several targets on their shortlists between them, but for sure the interest in Delap is concrete and genuine. My understanding is that Delap has spoken to Chelsea and to Manchester United, and now it’s time for him to explore all the options possible.",
      "A football finance expert has said Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday night means they will miss out on around £85million in additional revenue.",
      "Professor Rob Wilson, Director of Executive Education at University Campus of Football Business, has outlined just how costly United's failure to get back into the Champions League will be. \"Having lost the Europa League, Manchester United have probably missed out on something between £10m to £15m in direct prize money,\" Wilson told Genting Casino.",
      "\"That was made up of around £4m for winning the final, somewhere between £3m and £5m from an increased UEFA coefficient share. Then there's elements around commercial bonuses, appearance fees, match day revenues that they would have benefited from. What we then need to remember of course is that there will also be an offset there.",
      "\"So they won't have bonus payments to pay, for instance, for their player wages. So that's quite an important factor to include. The qualification that they've missed out on in the Champions League has cost them around £85m of additional revenue. That revenue is due to broadcast, gate receipts and some of those UEFA payments.",
      "\"The fact that the club has missed out on that revenue is quite a blow to their budget line and will affect what they're able to do in the transfer market this summer, not just from an amount of cash perspective and what they can spend on transfers but also the type of players they can attract as a result of having no European football given their league position.\"",
      "The club is reportedly aware of the conditions required to trigger the clause. However, there has been no 'direct contact' between the clubs so far, though those formalities are expected to happen once the season ends.",
      "Other clubs are also interested in Cunha, but he is thought to prefer a move to United.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Ruben Amorim retains the backing of the Manchester United hierarchy despite his offer to quit without accepting any compensation.",
      "Amorim said after United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur that he would walk away from the club if the board and supporters did not think he was the right man in charge.",
      "However, his future did not hinge on Wednesday night with the club hierarchy keen to repeat their mistake of keeping Erik ten Hag from last year. United are unlikely to issue a public vote of confidence in Amorim, having already initiated plans to enhance their squad in the summer."

      "Manchester United are facing a huge summer in their rebuild under Ruben Amorim after a desperately poor 2024/25 campaign.",

      "Defeat to Tottenham in the final in Bilbao not only saw United miss out on winning a European trophy but also a place in next season's Champions League.",
      "That has meant United have missed out on millions in potential prize money and revenue next season as they gear up for a season without European football next term.",
      "That being said, they must make some changes this summer in the transfer market and United are understood to be ready to back Defeat to Tottenham in the window.",
      "But they will have to rebalance the books and sell some players to make some headway to ensure the club don't fall foul of profit and sustainability rules.",
      "With that in mind, we have taken a look at United's three biggest transfer jobs facing them this summer",
      "Cunha is available to leave Wolves this summer and United are preparing to pay the £62.5million release clause to sign him.",
      "United are expecting to seal the signing of the 17-goal forward imminently and Amorim is keen to deploy the 25-year-old in one of this two attacking midfield slots in his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Delap has scored 12 goals for a relegated side this season and is available to sign for £30million. United are one of a number of clubs interested, and he has started to hold talks with interested parties, but they are hopeful they can convince the England under-21 international to lead their line next term.",
      "If United push through those moves that will see them part with £92.5million which represents a significant chunk of their budget.",
      "United will need a midfielder and possible upgrades at right-back and in goal. Former United midfielder Paul Scholes also suggested they need a more experienced forward too, even if they sign Delap.",
      "That is going to be expensive and United may struggle to make their budget stretch to solve all of their transfer priorities.",
      "That is where sales in the summer will be key for United to fund their rebuild.",
      "A number of players could leave Old Trafford but we understand the sales of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho have been prioritised to kickstart their summer clearout.",
      "All three players have tasted success on loan this season with Aston Villa, Real Betis and Chelsea respectively and will be in demand this summer.",
      "United have priced Rashford at £40million, Antony will be available for around £32.5m while Chelsea have an obligation to buy Sancho for a fee as high as £25m.",
      "That would see United bring in £97.5million in transfer sales before they even countenance any more sales. Casemiro could be sold amid interest from the Saudi Pro League, while Rasmus Hojlund could also be sold.",
      "Altay Bayindir is expected to leave, while there is also interest in Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. While their sales would not be popular, they would represent pure profit for United in the eyes of PSR.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to his 3-4-2-1 system since being appointed as manager but it is now clear that a number of United players just aren't suited to it.",
      "He will welcome pre-season for extended time on the training pitch to continue to bed in his ideas and no European football will help Amorim with that, too.",
      "But for him to succeed there clearly needs to be wholesale changes but any club would struggle to withstand too much change in one summer. That is a dilemma Amorim must manage to balance next season as the scrutiny over his role inevitably increases."

      "The sight of Leny Yoro's name among the starters at the San Mames Stadium on Wednesday evening immediately increased the confidence levels of Manchester United's supporters with 75 minutes to go until kick-off.",
      "After the Frenchman had recovered from a foot injury in time to be included in the 26-man squad Ruben Amorim named for the trip to Bilbao, United's supporters crossed their fingers in the hope of seeing him make the starting XI.",
      "Much to their delight, he was deemed fit enough to start the Europa League final and he lined up on the right of the back-three, joining forces with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw in defence.",
      "The Frenchman had suffered a foot injury ten days prior to the final, being forced off in United's 2-0 home defeat to West Ham United, and missed the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge five days later, with Amorim admitting he was in a battle against the clock to be fit in time.",
      "Ultimately, despite winning his fitness battle and becoming United's youngest starter in a European final since Brian Kidd back in 1968, it did not make a difference to the outcome.",
      "Brennan Johnson's first half winner sealed Spurs their first trophy in 17 years and condemned United to a second Europa League final defeat in five seasons. It also ended their aspirations of competing in the Champions League next season.",
      "United's powder-puff performance at the San Mames was symbolic of their season, meaning it has put immense strain on their plans for this summer's transfer window.",
      "Champions League qualification would have banked United a minimum of around £85million, meaning they will be guided through this summer's transfer window by Plan B instead.",
      "Understandably, the mood among United's supporters is at an all-time low. Many are sick to the back teeth of this current squad and would happily see Amorim take a sledgehammer to it this summer.",
      "As welcomed as that would be, it is simply unrealistic. United will not be able to oversee the volume of changes that are necessary in just one window.",
      "Instead, it means any hopes of the squad being completely gutted will be on hold. There will, of course, be departures, but not on the scale that is necessary.",
      "United plan for the number of departures to reach double figures. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are expected to be released and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Others, too, will follow them out the door. In truth, there are very few within the squad that should be safe from axe being wielded.",
      "However, there are three members of Amorim's squad that should be safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit this summer, with Yoro being one of them. The 19-year-old was United's most eye-catching signing last summer, with the Reds beating Real Madrid to his signature.",
      "He had a delayed start to his Old Trafford career after fracturing his metatarsal in pre-season, but he has since shown plenty of flashes of the defender United believe he can become. He is equally comfortable on both the right and the left of the back-three and his ball-playing credentials are impressive for a player still so young.",
      "Amad, who has also not been without injury problems this season, is another United should refuse to entertain any offers for. He has excelled under Amorim and was the only player who looked like making anything happen in Bilbao.",
      "Equally capable as a right wing-back or as a right-sided No.10, the Ivorian has excelled under Amorim's coaching methods. His hunger and desire to beat his man and make something happen inside the final third gets United's supporters out of their seats in anticipation that something will happen.",
      "United have always been blessed with players who are natural entertainers and Amad fits that criteria. The club tied him down to a new contract earlier this year and he will be key to Amorim's long-term plans to try and take United forward.",
      "Despite being 11 years Yoro's senior and eight years older than Amad, Bruno Fernandes is another player United should be ensuring is central to Amorim's thinking. No amount of words will sum up the Portuguese's importance, and this season would have been even worse without him.",
      "Outside of those three, you fear no-one else is safe from potentially being offloaded, and that even includes Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho."

      "If Fernandes does decide to move on, United simply can't waste time waiting to get their priority deals concluded. It can't happen.",
      "\"There is time for the Delap move to get finalised between now and then. Talks have been held already. It's down to United to make sure it doesn't get to a position where they have to wait.\""

      "In the same week that Manchester United fell short in the Europa League final, Scott McTominay rounded-off a sensational debut season in Italy by winning the Serie A title.",
      "McTominay said farewell to Old Trafford last summer after coming through their academy. Napoli paid £21million for his services with a potential £4.2m in add-ons. Under 12 months later, it proved to be one of the best transfers of the season.",
      "The midfielder scored 29 goals in 255 games for United - despite being played outside of his natural position at times. This season, he has bagged 13 goals and, on Friday night, he scored the first in Gli Azzurri's 2-0 win against Cagliari, crowning them champions of Italy.",
      "Napoli, who won the Serie A title in 2023 owing in the main to Victor Osimhen's goals, have turned a page under Antonio Conte. The signings of David Neres, Romelu Lukaku, McTominay and Billy Gilmour all had question marks over them, although they no longer exist now.",
      "At the time, a switch to Naples made sense for both McTominay and United. Manuel Ugarte arrived to boost Erik ten Hag's midfield from Paris Saint-Germain - after it was established that more \"grit\" was needed in the middle of the park.",
      "The Uruguay international has done well in his first season but Ruben Amorim - who didn't sign him but worked with him at Sporting CP - kept him places on the bench on Wednesday night. McTominay wouldn't look amiss in this United team.",
      "\"When I got into the first team, I was quite mis-profiled in where I was playing,\" he said in an interview with The Athletic. \"It wasn't the fault of any coaches. My strengths have always been getting into the box, scoring goals, being a problem in there. But I was being used as a No.6, or as a centre-back, and that has never really been my game.",
      "\"But when you're playing for Manchester United, and you're 20-years-old, you can't knock on the manager's door and say that you expect to be playing at No.8 ahead of Paul Pogba, it's not realistic. You have to know your place, and do what you're asked to do. In the last few seasons, I began to get into the box a bit more, and to score more goals, and then last year was my best one.\"",
      "If McTominay was in this current United team, then his quality would be there to demand a place in his preferred position. In fact, he's the latest player to leave the club and have success away from Manchester.",
      "Dean Henderson, Mason Greenwood, Alvaro Carreras, Antony, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga have all impressed once they have left the club. McTominay, who maybe wasn't a player many would have liked to see stay, has proved in the last season that he is - perhaps - the biggest transfer mistake made by Ineos."

      "Sporting endured a torrid run of form in the aftermath of Amorim’s exit that ended their Champions League hopes and jeopardised their title charge. Yet, they recovered to seal their third league triumph in five years last weekend.",

Hjulmand recently recalled expressing his bitter disappointment in front of his team-mates and Amorim, though it didn’t sway the manager’s decision.",
      "Hjulmand told A Bola: \"We thought that Amorim would stay for the season and fight to also be a two-time champion. Many players wanted to stay at Sporting with Ruben Amorim, because he is a great coach.”",
      "When asked if he felt betrayed, the Dane said: “That’s a very strong word. We feel disappointed with his departure. We were on a run of 11 consecutive wins, doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "“Everything was very clear to everyone on the pitch. It was almost as if we were playing Playstation. Everyone knew what they had to do.",

      "“He himself said the same thing at the start of the season. But afterwards, I also told Ruben that we understood his decision.”",

I knew that if I rejected Manchester United, in seven months' time I wouldn’t have that option available, and I knew that at the end of the season I was going to leave Sporting CP.",
      "“I could have felt a sense of regret that would be difficult to deal with. Between the disappointment of all Sportinguistas and taking risks in my career, or waiting for the end of the season and not having the only club that I wanted to join as an option, I had to decide. So I decided.”",
      "It’s unknown whether Amorim now regrets that decision nearly seven months on, having endured a torrid first season at Old Trafford. Under the Portuguese, United have consistently set new records for lows as the head coach struggles to impart his philosophy at the already-struggling club.",
      "United could finish this season in 17th place - one spot above relegation - in their worst Premier League campaign to date. And after losing the Europa League final in woeful fashion on Wednesday, Amorim has made it clear that he is open to leaving this summer if club bosses and fans decide he is the wrong man for the job."

It's possible to have those kinds of moments, I don't know if we would have kept the same level throughout the season, because I think it's very normal in football for there to be stages of the season when you maybe win every game and then there's a period when it's tougher.",
      "\"Of course, we always have the mentality of wanting to win every game, but as we've seen in football, it doesn't always end that way. I think it's very difficult to go through an entire season without losing a single game, as you can see in history, I don't think many teams have done it. It's one thing to win a lot of games and another thing to go a whole season without losing a game.\"",
      "Should United make a move for Gyokeres this summer, it wouldn't necessarily break the bank. There is a gentleman's agreement in the Swede's contract that, in theory, would allow him to depart for a fee ranging from £55million to £60m - significantly less than his £84.3m (€100m) release clause.",

Let's see, it's the future, and it's football as well, so you never know what's going to happen. As you've seen this season, you never know what's going to happen, and it's the same now.

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly set to demand that the club prioritise pace and strength in the summer transfer window to compete in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's men will be without European football next season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday night.",
      "While the lack of Champions League is a huge blow for the Reds, the focus solely on domestic football could offer them a chance to significantly improve their position in English football.",
      "To do this, it is largely agreed that Amorim will need to oversee a major rebuild of this squad. Wolverhampton Wanderers' Matheus Cunha is the top target for the Reds and he is reportedly set to arrive first at Carrington.",
      "Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is also at the top of the list for United and both signings can be made without the need to sell players. However, beyond that point, United will need to rely on selling the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony to help boost Amorim's budget.",
      "According to ESPN, if United do manage to make those sales, Amorim has a clear vision for how the new recruits should look. It is believed that the Portuguese head coach has noticed United's inability to compete physically against Premier League teams this season.",
      "The report claims that before the Europa League final, Amorim was concerned that United could be outmuscled by Spurs in the midfield particularly. With those concerns met, Amorim is keen for that not to be the case again next season.",
      "Central midfield recruits will likely be needed in the summer with Christian Eriksen set to depart and Casemiro's future still unclear.",
      "At least one attacking midfielder is also needed especially after Alejandro Garnacho's apparent unhappiness with his game time at Old Trafford."

      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",
      "Amorim is among the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked as he’s endured a horrible six months at Old Trafford.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon boss was headhunted by INEOS following their decision to sack Erik ten Hag and he decided to join Man Utd mid-season, despite initially being against this idea.",
      "Amorim should be regretting this decision as he’s swapped a title race in Portugal to a basket case in Manchester as his dismal squad has failed to get accustomed to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Performances and results under Amorim have been worse than they were under Ten Hag as Man Utd are at risk of finishing 17th in the Premier League. They have also come up short in the Europa League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup, so they won’t play in Europe next season.",
      "It would be harsh to sack Amorim before he’s had the opportunity to build a more-suited squad, but former Man Utd assistant Rene Meulensteen reckons he’ll be gone after ten games next season on one condition.",
      "“He has to win eight out of 10 or 90% of the games at the start of the season, that’s how long ten Hag was given (sacked after nine league and one EFL cup games on October 28th),” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",
      "READ: Ranking every Manchester United player’s season: Horrible Hojlund to Fernandes via Garnacho",

      "“I’ve not been very convinced by the way he has addressed the media. People applaud him for his honesty, but at some point, you have to realise the position at the club that you manage, and the position the club is in. What people want to hear is a vision, a strategy, a way forward.",
      "“People want to know how you can get out of this mess rather than reinforcing how bad it is, but I don’t hear that. He’s questioning too many things, and he’s questioning himself, and that is never a good thing.",
      "“Amorim should have done better because he’s had plenty of time now working with the players, and you question the disconnect when you constantly see these poor performances. Do they lack quality? Are the messages not getting across to the players? Or is it the rigid system?”",
      "Meulensteen has also argued that the “writing is on the wall” for Amorim, who has made one huge “mistake”.",
      "“The writing has been on the wall for quite some time. You could see there was a negative line in terms of performances and results under ten Hag. Eventually, when that line was persistently going down, they got rid of ten Hag to bring Amorim in,” Muelensteen added.",
      "“If you look through all the stats, all the numbers, and all the performances, that line continues to decline. Apart from in the Europa League, which was a different competition, and even then, it required luck in the miracle game against Lyon. They could have easily been knocked out, and you would have looked at a far more dour season.",
      "“Amorim made a mistake in the beginning by saying ‘I want to play the 3-4-3 system, and I’m not going to change’, so he started putting round pegs in square holes.",
      "“He could have done himself favours by saying, ‘I’m in favour of playing a 3-4-3, I’ve had a lot of success with it. However, I don’t know yet if that will work for Manchester United yet I need to get to know the players, I need to get to know the league’.",
      "“That would have given him far more flexibility to tweak it a little bit here and there, because at the end of the day, you’re in the results business.”",

      "Spurs and the Europa\nI am a 50 year old, Australian born, lifelong Spurs supporter. When I say lifelong, I mean it. I’m named for Martin Chivers, Steve Perryman and Pat Jennings. My dad was a season ticket holder before my parents moved here in the 70s. One of my most prized possessions is a congratulatory card to my parents after my birth, signed by the first team at the time.",
      "I remember being woken at midnight to watch the 81 and 82 FA Cup finals and talking to my dad after the 1991 final, his last.",
      "When I finally moved to England for a few years in 2001, the first thing I did was get a ticket to White Hart Lane (3-0 vs Coventry). I was at the Lane to see us beaten 3-0 by Chelsea, took my now wife to see the godawful loss to Sam Allardyce’s Bolton just after Bill Nick died. I was even there for the league cup collapse to 10 man Manchester City.",
      "This is all why Wednesday night/Thursday morning meant so much, even from so far away. It’s the first trophy of my 15 year old son’s life (by his age, we had 3, including the 84 UEFA cup) and watching it with him made me think about my own father and how much he’d have loved to see it.",
      "Luckily for my son, as I grew up on the Central Coast I made the Mariners my A-League team and he’s seen 3 grand final wins (including last year when we made it there) and another grand final win for the women’s team last Sunday (yes – some of us do watch women’s football).",
      "The Europa league final was awful. The league form, even before putting all of the eggs in the EL basket, inexcusable.",
      "I don’t care. I don’t much like Ange, but he’s right. This was for the true believers. I’m raising a glass and toasting this team and all of the Spurs supporters who share the joy with me.",
      "Finally – thank you Nick Montgomery. Suspended for the 2013 Grand Final win. Head coach for the 2023 GF win and now Ange’s assistant for the EL win.\nMarty",

      "Wow.. what a few days.",
      "As a Spurs fan, even at the best of times, you know you’re gonna get punched in the mouth every now and again. This season, it felt like being a few rounds deep with Muhammad Ali most weeks.",
      "Despite it all, for Ange Postecoglou and that group of players to persist and persevere, and push through all the negativity, the crises of confidence, the injuries, the noise, and to come out the other side holding their first trophy in nearly 20 years is inspiring.",
      "I only got to catch up on F365 mailboxes today, so I got a nice little chuckle at all the panicked rationalizing from other fans: It’s only the Europa League, two terrible teams, worst final ever, Don’t deserve Champions League, tallest dwarf, etc. Seeing opposition fans horrified that they can no longer ‘banter’ Spurs over being trophyless, and scrambling to find new sticks to beat Spurs it is delightful. You keep doing whatever you need to do guys, we’ll just keep watching the clips of Sonny lifting the cup on repeat. (Although credit to David Tickner, who I’ve criticised for his anti-Spurs takes before, for his magnanimous article celebrating Spurs and Ange!)",
      "But really I wanted to write in about Ange – and to say to Ange I’m sorry I ever doubted.",
      "I was a huge Ange advocate since the beginning. He wasn’t a mercenary like Jose or Conte, temporarily gracing lowly Spurs with his presence. He was a man with passion and a vision. He was going to make Spurs winners again. He was going to rebuild the culture at the club. He was going to make fans and players believe. And he was going to do it playing exciting, attacking football.",
      "The attacking, exciting football part has been a bit of a problem. It’s glorious when it’s good, but when it’s been bad, it’s been awful. Dizzyingly high defensive lines, gaps in positions, and a dreadful injury crisis meant we were cannon fodder for teams who could sit back and wait to counterattack on us. 20+ league defeats later, and even I, a big Ange-truther, was beginning to say this project had run its course.",
      "He was ridiculed in the press. He’s been hounded out of his job in every interview. F365 among others have kept a regularly refreshed list of his potential successors live on the site since October. When we were dumped out of the league cup and FA cup, journalists were quick to smugly ask him if he was still going to win something in his second season.",
      "And he did.",
      "For him to take all that flack for himself, to bear all the brunt of the criticism, so that the players could focus on the job to be done is incredible. He’s led them to success for the first time in 20 years. Something Conte, Pochettino, Mourinho, Redknapp never did. He always wins things in his second season, mate.",
      "But what now? I’m conflicted.",
      "The league form was truly awful, and while it might be absolved, given the Europa success, it could never be acceptable again. My head says maybe the best thing is for Ange to leave now as a hero, who brought this team back to the winners circle, and calls it a promise kept. Spurs move on, and bring in a Thomas Frank or someone to hopefully build on this momentum, but take us in a slightly new, more pragmatic direction. Fresh start.",
      "But I think the heart says different. Ange says his work is not yet done. And the players seem to agree. Despite everything, the likes of Van de Ven, Maddison, Kulusevski, Bissouma, Vicario and others have come to bat for Ange – “We want to win this for him”. For him to keep the belief of a dressing room after a season like that is incredible. After an achievement like Wednesday, that bond will be even stronger. If I thought Ange could adapt his style, and adopt elements of the pragmatic style that won him his last few European fixtures, and if the chairman could support him in the transfer market, then I think the option that would make me happiest is to see us press ahead with Big Ange!",
      "Either way, huge congrats to Ange – Spurs fans will never forget the success he’s brought. I’ll always be wishing for his success, in our dugout, or another.\nAndy, Spurs, Eire",
      "",
      "Ange stays and Ruben goes\nThanks to a flight delay, I got to watch the first 30 minutes of the Europa League final, but had to shut down before the goal. I wasn’t terribly disappointed to turn it off, because it was awful. When I landed, I learned the result and saw the goal credited to Brennan Johnson, but my son had commented in the EPL Discord group we share with my friends and their friends that it was a Shaw OG. That’s just funnier, and I would prefer to believe it.",
      "With many apologies to Tottenham supporters — you’ve my sincere congratulations on your Europa League win, and I’m quite jelly, because it beats our pot sideways — I generally appreciate F365’s evident editorial pleasure in regarding Spurs as Spursy and openly endorsing in advance the funniest possible Europa League Final narrative vis-à-vis Spurs. I hope you’ll understand: it’s an objectively funny narrative precisely because it’s silly.",
      "So, Spurs haven’t won a trophy in 17 years? Cry me a river. That’s far more success than Newcastle United or Crystal Palace could boast in 2024, so it’s hard to feel very bad about having that particular laugh. Especially when it’s more or less true; Spurs’ league form has been shocking.",
      "But I agree with Tickner and several Mailbox contributors that the cup win changes things for Ange Postecoglou. Unless you want to consider the possibility that he’s the Kwisatz Haderach, you have to treat his prophecy as merely a demonstrable trend. This is the fifth consecutive job in which he’s won a trophy in his second season, and trophies aren’t available every year for an international coach. I’ve little doubt he left the Australia job precisely because he knew he couldn’t win them a World Cup, asked himself what succeeding would look like, and didn’t like the answer.",
      "Big Ange may just be what he appears to be at this moment: a remarkably adaptable coach for whom short-term success is very likely, but is only now beginning his first attempt at sustained success at the highest level. I’m not aware of how much input he has in transfers, but I’d call most of the bigger outlays attributed to him moderately successful; extremely successful, if the goal Levy set was a trophy in year two.",
      "Spurs supporters may have a different perspective, but I have a lifetime of experience with volatile team owners in the US, and it’s hard for me to imagine Daniel Levy firing Ange right now. It would alienate many (though I suspect not all) supporters, and trophies are what an owner looks for in a coach or manager. Prize money, and the guarantee of more prize money next year.",
      "And if Levy does push the eject button, Ange will likely have a wealth of opportunities and a very happy agent. He’s in the catbird seat right now, as we inexplicably say in the Southeastern US.",
      "Also: given our cup history over my lifetime, I can almost never find it in myself to be disappointed with a Manchester United loss. The stats seem to suggest they should have won, and Amorim is accused of mismanagement in 16 Conclusions. Indeed, one wonders if a Jim Ratcliffe-influenced board might just snatch at his offer to decline compensation if sacked.",
      "A financial path forward for ManU is tough to chart. Among the academy graduates, Mainoo seems to be the most saleable asset, and his value is debatable at the moment and is most likely greatest as a homegrown member of the squad. Abandoning the 343 (or however you want to characterize Amorim’s system) and hiring a manager to make better use of the talent already present — Mason Mount might qualify, for example — while the rebuild proceeds in a more natural direction might be a good idea.",
      "What Manchester United needs is flexibility, and Amorim may not be able to provide that on the available transfer budget. Or willing to provide it at all. On the other hand, they won’t have the bother of Europe next season.\nChris C, Toon Army DC (Ambivalent over the playoff final. LALAS or derbies? Both are wonderful.)",
      "",
      "Over the United fatalism\nWhat did we learn out of the Europa League final that we didn’t already know? Honest question…",
      "A United team which has been poor for six-odd months was poor again and lost. The overall depth and quality of a team which is shoddy in defence, lacks bite and control in midfield, and has next-to-no goals in it was, you guessed it, shoddy in defence, lacked bite and control in midfield and drew a blank.",
      "Spurs, to their credit, were able to be slightly less poor on the night and unconvincingly accounted for the worst United side in 50 years.",
      "Well done.",
      "But can we put a pin in the Manchester United fatalism? No United fan is happy with where the Club sits, how it’s being managed and how it’s performing – but maybe, just maybe, this is the opportunity to properly, actually reset the Club has needed for years.",
      "No papering over the cracks, no playing dress-ups at the big table of European football, no fixtures and competitions we’re nowhere near good enough to properly compete in for now…",
      "This is the chance to start a build we should’ve undertaken post-Jose. A proper, top-to-bottom rebuild. The open-heart surgery Rangnick diagnosed.",
      "Easier said than done, sure, and a far from linear process… but a chance to move beyond the quick fix, short term vanity signings which have plagued us for years and look for players who a/ fit a profile and method of play and b/ are not signing to pump up their pensions.",
      "And before anyone starts, if rival fans seriously think there’s no allure to signing for and becoming a Manchester United star, you’re kidding yourself. So let’s find the players for whom that means something.",
      "Come in, be a part of something from the ground up and be a reason this Club turns things around. It’s Manchester United – something which has always meant something and still does, no matter how loudly opposition fans protest it doesn’t.",
      "And on the fatalism… worst case for Manchester United is results get so dire the Glazers sell up and f**k off. Which would be a magnificent result – maybe the single worst result for the Club’s rivals, to be honest.",
      "It’s pretty easy to support your team when the going is good. For all the disappointments in recent times they’ve given me plenty to cheer about across the journey… I now hope they can begin the slow march back towards contention at home and abroad.\nSean Peter-Budge, Melbourne, Australia",
      "",
      "Suck it up\nGet a grip.",
      "This is my message to my fellow Man Utd fans.",
      "We are in the ‘find out’ phase of a decade and a half of chronic incompetence; mistakes compounded by mistakes; a relentless pursuit of a sunken cost fallacy brought on by our arrogance, impatience and an overbearing weight of expectation.",
      "We have chopped and changed managers and gameplans every 3yrs never allowing for any true synergy between manager and squad. We have signed players based on reputation and commercial viability with leveraged transfer fees that we still owe around £300m on. We have doled out massive, long term contracts to panic buys & ‘marquee’ signings which has had the knock on effect of massively inflating wages throughout the squad. Basically, think of any clichéd football mistake and we have made it repeatedly. Of course we’re shite!",
      "Our situation right now has been inevitable for a long time. What we need to do now is shut up, take our medicine and be patient. If you need somewhere to focus your frustration and anger about it all, the Glazers should be the target. INEOS haven’t been perfect (SJR’s petty cuts towards the ordinary folk at the club are pointless besides demonstrating that he is a monumental tw*t) but they have been sound so far with transfers; Yoro, Dorgu, Ugarte, Zirkzee and Heaven have all looked good so far.",
      "The last thing we need to do is sack Amorim. We need a period of continuity where we have a plan and we stick to it. There are too many mitigating factors to confidently say that he is the problem.",
      "343 looks like the incoming paradigm so remoulding our squad to fit it is a sound, forward thinking plan even if we do eventually move on from Amorim.",
      "Amorim being pragmatic and adapting to the players we have would just be repeating Erik Ten Hag’s mistake. Form would improve then inevitably tank as he tries to transition to his style. He’d get sacked anyway, the next manager would inherit another Frankenstein squad and we’ll be back to square one. Better to just push ahead with his ideas and get the most painful phase out the way first. We will improve when he has more suitable players.",
      "Being out of Europe gives us an opportunity to cull the squad this summer. If we set our target for next season to a top 10 finish, we can be more bold with game time for academy players and aim lower (with a much broader pool) for signings with an emphasis on suitability for the system.",
      "We are in a reset phase where our expectations need to be adjusted to give us time & space to lay new foundations.",
      "There is reason for optimism but stop expecting it all to happen immediately. The boat has sailed on any hope of a quick fix. We now need to be methodical and precise.",
      "And for those of us who grew up in the glory days, now is the time to prove for once and for all that we are not glory hunters.\nTom, Tooting",
      "",
      "Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes\nI read recently to my dismay and bitter disappointment that Amorim said he did not intend to change anything. If this is true, it would the most irresponsible and uncaring statement a Head Coach can make.",
      "Under Amorim’s reign, Man United have set and broken all sorts of unwanted, undesired and humiliating records.  Most United fans are hurting and, for the Head Coach to say he would not change anything, is more than an insult.",
      "Results and performances don’t lie. Clearly, his system, tactics, mass rotation, team selection and substitutions have, by and large, failed. In my profession, as it is in all other professions and areas of human endeavour, if the situation is retrogressing, changes are identified and made. I don’t belong to the school of thought which advocates the unnecessary sacking of coaches but, if Amorim’s publicly professed contention is not to make changes, then he must leave. No changes would lead to more pain next season and that is not acceptable.",
      "I urge all United fans and everyone who has interest in our beloved club to impress upon Amorim to make effective changes. Changes constitute a ‘sini qua non’ for success.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",
      "",
      "Compare and contrast\nGood morning",
      "Please compare Liverpool and ManU’s deroute and ways of tackling them during their respective transitions. What errors have the two clubs made? What good things have they done? Why was the transition in Liverpool ultimately a success, while it doesn’t look too good for ManU? Where have ManU repeated the errors made by LFC? And why haven’t they learned anything from history?",
      "And probably many more questions.",
      "Thanks",
      "Kind regards\nMichael from Denmark  – LFC-fan,  but curious about the similarities between the two mastodons and their situations (both Hicks/Gilette and the Glazers are nincompoops!)."

      "According to reports, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe will ‘axe 200 jobs’ on Friday and staff morale at the club has hit ‘rock bottom’.",
      "INEOS chief Ratcliffe has been heavily criticised over the past year as he’s quickly become an incredibly unpopular figure at Man Utd.",
      "Initially, the British billionaire’s takeover was met with overwhelming positivity, but this has swiftly eroded as he’s made several brutal cuts.",
      "One of Ratcliffe’s priorities has been to cut costs at Old Trafford and while this is necessary, some cuts have been deemed overly severe as morale at the club has taken a severe hit.",
      "Ratcliffe has sanctioned mass redundancies, cut benefits to club legends, scrapped free lunches for staff and has hiked ticket prices.",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘brains trust’ demoted while Slot ‘turns on’ Alexander-Arnold (and Salah)",
      "Ratcliffe claims Man Utd ran the risk of going “bust by Christmas” without these cuts, but this is hard to believe considering they have announced plans for a new 100,000-seater stadium and still have a £100m transfer budget after the loss to Spurs in the Europa League final.",

      "A few hours later, a report from The Telegraph confirmed Man Utd will ‘axe 200 jobs today’, with staff morale at ‘rock bottom’.",
      "Around 250 staff were dismissed last summer and a further 200 individuals ‘will discover if they have lost their jobs today’.",
      "It is noted that ‘swingeing cuts’ are expected with staff ‘braced’ to be affected in areas ‘across an array of football and non-football departments, including scouting, analysts and commercial, as United streamline operations’.",
      "There could be ugly scenes at Old Trafford on Sunday as Man Utd host Aston Villa in their final game of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The 1958 fans’ group have confirmed plans for another protest against Ratcliffe and the Glazer family on Sunday.",
      "“We will start on Sir Matt Busby Way to symbolise the standards that are being decayed and lost, installed by Sir Matt and profoundly precious to all of us,” the 1958 said.",
      "“The club is drowning in over a billion pounds of debt, our fanbase is fractured and divided and our stadium neglected – [all] down to Glazer greed and betrayal. They’ve taken everything.",
      "“Now, even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival has come at the cost of hundreds of jobs, further punishing a fanbase already suffering under the Glazers’ reign. Lifelong loyal supporters are being driven away from the club they love – priced out and pushed aside. Another dagger in the heart of our footballing community.",
      "“We march. As one fanbase. To make it clear: 20 years on, the fire still burns Red – with fury and defiance. We want the Glazers out of our club.”",

      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing Erik ten Hag at the end of 2024, losing 16 of his 41 matches in all competitions.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon initially wanted to join Man Utd at the end of this season, but INEOS pushed for him to arrive immediately and this has backfired.",
      "The 40-year-old has attempted to implement a new system in the middle of the season and has unsurprisingly found this incredibly difficult with Man Utd’s squad unsuited to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Without ready-made wing-backs or suitable No.10s, Man Utd’s system has been ineffective for months as they have been toothless in attack.",
      "READ: Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "Man Utd could still finish 17th in the Premier League this season and they were dealt a severe blow on Wednesday night, losing 1-0 to Spurs in the Europa League final to miss out on a trophy and Champions League football.",
      "Carragher thinks Man Utd chiefs need to start asking whether they ‘appointed the wrong manager at the wrong time’.",
      "‘At some point during their post-season review of a dire campaign, someone in the Manchester United boardroom will need the courage to ask the toughest question: “Did we appoint the wrong manager at the wrong time?”’ Carragher wrote for The Telegraph.",
      "‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe may still believe Ruben Amorim is one of the best young coaches of his generation. He may think that, had Amorim not joined United last November, he would have been hired by another top European club and excelled.",
      "‘He may also be sure that if United had the same funds to rebuild the team as Amorim’s predecessors had at their disposal, it would be a question of when, not if, United return to the top of the English and European game.",
      "‘But in the aftermath of a dismal Europa League final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, the dilemma around Amorim is more complicated than for any of those who have tried and failed at Old Trafford since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.’",
      "Carragher has also floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Amorim and Man Utd amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "‘Now that his six months in charge have gone so badly, Ratcliffe and his Ineos colleagues will need a decisive plan for how he will navigate the club through the most challenging period in United’s modern history,’ Carragher continued.",
      "‘Their grave concern must be that they have seen absolutely no evidence so far to suggest he is up to it. On that basis, backing Amorim this summer may be the honourable option, but it is not necessarily the bravest.",
      "‘Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.’",
      "He added: ‘The much-anticipated tactical innovations, and development of younger players, have been non-existent.",
      "‘The only successful game-changing strategy Amorim has offered is throwing Harry Maguire up front for the final few minutes of European games.’",
      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United’s loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final ‘confirmed’ a ‘fear’ that Ruben Amorim has about his squad.",
      "Man Utd have responded to an offer from Ruben Amorim to leave Old Trafford without compensation after losing the Europa League final on Wednesday.",

      "Not quite. He just said, “I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute he was on training ground. In my opinion there were certain moments he could do more, to put it mildly. I told him he’s a much better defender than people think, but you don’t show it all the time.”",
      "Which is a) hardly a particularly controversial thing for a new manager to say to a player, and most importantly b) not the full quote, despite that being all the MailOnline offers.",

      "“Maybe he said it himself, he’s going to leave either way so why not tell. Maybe it’s already a first gift I can give Xabi Alonso. But I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute how he was on the training ground. In my opinion in certain moments he could do a bit more, to say it mildly, and that’s what we talked about.",
      "“Combined with that I said to him: ‘You are a much better defender than everybody tells you, unfortunately you don’t show it all the time, that’s why people sometimes say you are not’.",
      "“If he is just at it and focused and concentrated, there are not many players that can go around him, because he’s fast, he’s agile, he has great mentality.",
      "“But it’s about showing that every single game, because in this world we are judged not only on the 34 games we do well, we are mainly judged on the four games we don’t do so well.",
      "“These things we spoke about in pre-season.”",
      "Again, it sounds a hell of a lot like an incoming coach having some pretty standard, constructive observations about one of his new players. And the best bit is that Slot’s answer was prefaced with this line, which changes everything completely:",
      "“I think Mo has said already a few things about why he was in my office in pre-season and there were similar reasons why Trent was in my office in the beginning of the season!”",
      "So this was in pre-season and Slot had similar conversations with Salah, who recently explained: “He showed me a few videos of myself in the warm-up. I was like quite slow, didn’t do much. Then he showed me, ‘look at the second [player] after he sees you take it easy, look at the third one’. Then you see the whole line walking like me and he said, ‘that’s your influence on the team’.”",
      "Did Slot ‘turn on’ Salah and ‘fire criticism’ at him at the time? Or does it only count when the player in question is in the middle of a controversial departure?",

But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors.",
      "“And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "The INEOS brains trust can only be trusted with one more decision\nAs a United fan who didn’t even bother watching the Europa League final, I’m not the least bit surprised by the outcome. Manchester United are in complete shambles right now. The arrival of Ratcliffe has been so disastrous that even Ed Woodward starts to look like a footballing genius in comparison.",
      "United’s problems are numerous, but the most glaring issue is this: we can’t even decide what’s worse — the players or the managers. When it comes to both Erik ten Hag and Amorim, it’s safe to say that, as poor as the current squad is, the managers have been even worse. And therein lies the root of our troubles.",
      "We have no Director of Football. Our scouting network is non-existent or laughable at best. This leaves the manager (the one who can’t do their own jobs) to also do the scouting, resulting in hundreds of millions wasted on signings who have consistently failed to meet expectations. Under Ten Hag, huge sums were spent chasing his priority targets, yet almost every one of them has proven to be a disappointment. In contrast, Amorin is still demadning players for a system that has shown no evidence of working in the Premier League.",
      "The reality? United are expected to finish this season with 39 points — just above the relegation zone. In many other seasons, that would have meant relegation. Remember the outrage when United finished 7th under David Moyes, and that was without the financial backing ETH was given for instance.",
      "So what’s the solution?",
      "Unfortunately, the current management structure is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon. There will be no Director of Football appointment, no meaningful improvement to the scouting network, and no overhaul of the training facilities. The people in charge simply don’t seem capable of making the right decisions.",
      "This leaves us with only one viable option — one that comes with the caveat that it has not worked out too well in the past but is the only realistic path forward now. We need to hire an experienced, truly elite manager. Someone with a proven track record of winning titles and the full backing of the club. This manager should be entrusted with all football decisions — from which players to buy and sell, to upgrading facilities, restructuring the medical team, and establishing a reliable scouting and data analysis network.",
      "Most importantly, this manager must be given complete autonomy, no matter how much resistance or dissent there may be from players, he must be backed to the hilt season after season. Because the only thing the current board and management can be trusted with is one decision only, hiring the manager. And that too out of sheer necessity. Beyond that, let the only adult at the club (read: new manager hopefully) make all the decisions from thereon. Because, this United board and management have proven repeatedly that to allow them to make even a single more decision would be folly of the highest order.\nAdeel",
      "",
      "So, for the third season in a row, United found themselves in a cup final looking to salvage their season, only this time, they went to the well and they found there was nothing left for them.",
      "You can’t keep putting off the inevitable. This is a large scale rebuild. It will involve gradually shipping out 10 players and trying to bring in 10 who are an improvement on those going out. That’s a 3, 4, 5 year project. There is no quick fix. There are no shortcuts. The last two years have been sticking plasters, but you can’t keep putting plasters on open fractures. Sooner or later you have to accept that you require more advanced help.",
      "As I have said previously, the problem with United is that are yet to confront their reality. They may have the most Instagram followers in Kenya or whatever, but that is worth absolutely nothing on a football pitch. They need to accept where they are and what they are. Until they do, they will continue to go backwards.\nAndy H, Swansea.",

      "Dramatic? Perhaps. But if the Europa League final really was “do or die”, well, United didn’t “do”. It feels like a death knell and I expect a lot of black worn at Old Trafford on Sunday for the blessed relief of the season finale. We didn’t deserve to win the Europa and certainly do not deserve Champions League football in 2025-26.",
      "You know things are bad when rival fans have (mostly) stopped laughing and are expressing sincere concern. I guarantee Spurs will be nowhere near the bottom 3 next season. I wish I could express the same confident claim about my own club, but I for one just cannot see an escape out of this doom spiral.",
      "Our best players are likely to be moved on (for tuppence ha’penny, natch); our once-coveted manager looks like he’s hating every single minute of his life and our tight-as-a-gnat’s arse part-owner is similarly regretting his life choices, whilst looking for all the world like a child’s doodle of a medieval king magically made flesh.",
      "The Championship is beckoning. Money can only insulate you from failure for so long in football. The last time we were relegated in 1974, it was only six years after becoming England’s first champions of Europe. With greater finances involved in modern football, it has insulated us for longer, but not for much longer, at this rate in any case. I will never stop loving my club and all its glorious (and inglorious) history, but I am really not looking forward to more of the same next season.",
      "A good start would be to stop losing to Spurs! Nothing against them, but four defeats to Tottenham in the same season? Four?! That’s insane. I’m pleased for big Ange, a man often luckless, scorned and derided. But to actually deliver on his pre-season pledge to “always” win a trophy in his second season?

      "Manchester United (1878-2025) is over. I was thinking earlier this season, as a Liverpool fan, that if somehow they got relegated I would quit watching football or caring about the Premier League altogether (not the Champions League of course….) because it would be meaningless to entertain a rivalry when your biggest rival has been destroyed beyond repair. Of course, they didn’t get relegated -but gave it shot- yet United being United, they managed to produce an outcome just as humiliating and unbelievable; lose a European final to Tottenham. (To add insult to injury, without Maddison, Kulusevski, Bergvall…. basically, their best attacking options) 🤯",
      "Lost a European final to Tottenham… (try not to laugh reading that over and over again). They will have to live with that stain forever now. The last European trophy Spurs won was against Anderlecht, a club which fittingly has disappeared from the world stage. How do you live past that as a “proud football club” when Tottenham was the perennial butt of jokes for a reason?? Even hours before the match Paul Scholes was asked to revisit on TV the “lads, it’s Tottenham” pep talk Fergie gave them in the dressing room which became a meme, running joke, soundbite whatever to exemplify the complete helplessness and failure inherent to Tottenham. And yet, you’ve become their b****, Spurs beat them 4 times this season!!! 🤣",
      "In the end of the day, level at league titles and with twice as many European cups, the history books will tell the story that Liverpool beat Tottenham in a Champions League final but Manchester United lost to Spurs in a Europa League final. There are levels to this game. Liverpool has to find a new “biggest fixture” to look forward to because the English Derby no longer is. We may have to manufacture a rivalry with City going forward because United died this season. They’re just the gift that keeps on giving, having perfected the art of failure. You could not script a better season ending from a Liverpool fan’s standpoint.\nRaúl H. García (Number 7 next season and I’m done) LFC-YNWA 1892",
      "",
      "I was reading bits of the mailbox and Man Utd fans thinking out loud about how to forge a path ahead. Youth was mentioned an awful lot but here is the thing: if you were a talented player under 16 you would not sign for Man Utd right now.",
      "To protect kids and not disrupt families most clubs have to recruit within a geography but that means that Man Utd are competing with Man City and Liverpool for top youth players. Which team would you rather sign for if you were 12 years old right now?",
      "There’s no class of 92 that’s going to be emerging any time soon in my opinion. And the class of 92 had top professionals like Cantona to learn from; who would a kid in the youth team look up to right now other than Bruno?",
      "The club has cancer and it’s been allowed to persist so long that it’s infected almost everything. That combined with a disgruntled feeling from all the staff who Genius Jim has screwed to save £58 a week means that the morale couldn’t be lower.",
      "I don’t see Amorim as the answer and this £100m summer war Chest won’t go far when so much is about to be spent on Cunha making a step down.",
      "I’m obviously enjoying this malaise rather a lot. The summer of optimism will also be great before it comes crashing down on opening day when you lose at home to Fulham.\nMinty, LFC",
      "",
      "We do talk about Bruno\nI was really glad one of your 16 Conclusions on the final picked up on the double Bruno Fernandes turnover in the Spurs half prior to the goal. This gets glossed over so many times, especially when United play well or get a result. The amount of times he gives the ball away unnecessarily is astonishing.",
      "It got me to thinking after the game. If Fernandes were the talisman he is reputed to be. If he’s such a great goal scorer, creator, leader, why have none of the big clubs not come in for him? At the very least, why has there not been the odd rumour at the end of a non-disastrous season, linking him with Spain, Italy or Bayern?",
      "I think the answer to this is that they don’t want him. Is he a good player? Absolutely! But he’s not good enough to be constantly forgiven his wasteful passes, Hollywood balls, whining and moaning at the ref and team mates? I can’t understand how the 6 managers (interim included) he’s worked under since joining United have all deemed him undroppable. Not just that, he’s rarely subbed off",
      "United are in a very precarious position right now. There was talk earlier this season of a relegation battle. I shrugged that off, thinking there’s no way the quality of the teams at the bottom of the table would threaten a side of full internationals. But watching the game last night I could honestly say that I wouldn’t put a tenner on United to beat any of the 3 relegated sides if they were to meet in a week’s time with full strength sides. I don’t think the teams coming up this season from the Championship will be as bad as the 3 going down and I think Leeds and Burnley will have learned their lessons form previous bounces and prepare better for the upcoming top flight season.",
      "So if United want to keep doing the same thing, with the same players, then I genuinely feel next season could be worse than this. And if Bruno Fernandes is still the captain, playing 90 mins every week, no matter how bad his performances are, then they can have no complaints if next May they find themselves in must win matches to avoid dropping to the championship.",
      "I would like to clarify that I’m not laying all the blame for the current sh*t show at his feet. There are a number of players not fit to wear the shirt and the managers have to take a lot of blame too. But this is one area that seems to be constantly ignored and needs to be debated. Are United better off with Fernandes or without. Some fans might see Fernandes leaving as the last finger pulled from the dyke but I think his removal from the team would allow others to step up with an increased focus on in-game tactics. Just look what happened PSG when Mbappe left and the team became less of a one man show.\nMick, Newcastle",

      "Tinpot\nI’d like to address the concept that because of the finalists poor league performance and the poor quality game that the Europa League is now a tinpot trophy and shouldn’t get CL qualification.",
      "By this logic Wigan’s famous win, which wasn’t a great game, the same year they got relegated made the FA cup a championship level competition not worth European qualification.",
      "What about Denmark or Greece winning the Euros? Not the biggest teams nor the best football which would make that competition tinpot now as well.",

Even Tiramisu becomes boring after the fifteen bowl. Probably. The rewards being divided between the wealthy few is bad for everyone so I make this a good season.",

My group WhatsApp was popping off, and if anyone deserves some joy after a season of misery, it’s them, they took a lot of heat after league games.",

      "Man Utd have responded to an offer from Ruben Amorim to leave Old Trafford without compensation after losing the Europa League final on Wednesday.",

      "Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as Man Utd head coach in November but their Premier League performances and results have been no better under the Portuguese boss.",
      "Man Utd are 16th in the Premier League heading into the final weekend of fixtures with the Red Devils winning just ten matches all season.",
      "It has been a campaign full of misery for Amorim – who was already reportedly talked out of resigning earlier this season – and the Man Utd boss offered to leave without compensation on Wednesday after their defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Amorim said: “In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself. I cannot do it, it is really hard for me.",
      "READ: Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "“I have nothing to show to the fans to say I am going to improve.",
      "“So in this moment it is a little bit of faith. Let’s see. I am always open, if the board and the fans feel I am not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation.",
      "“But I will not quit. I am really confident on my job. As you can see I will not change nothing in the way I do things.”",
      "But the Daily Telegraph have claimed that Man Utd ‘refuse to take up’ Amorim’s offer to resign and leave without compensation.",
      "It is understood that the Man Utd boss ‘retains the full backing’ of the club’s board and that ‘Amorim’s position is unaffected by Wednesday’s defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final as they prepare to intensify efforts to reshape a chronically underperforming squad to the manager’s needs this summer’.",
      "Man Utd ‘accepted this season was always going to be a challenge as they transitioned to a new system and style of play’ and that Amorim ‘was always aware his future was not contingent on the outcome of one game, or his calamitous first season and that the United hierarchy accept they are facing a long-term rebuild that requires time and patience’.",
      "The Red Devils will look to provide Amorim with the tools he needs to make Man Utd successful again next season with Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo two of the names linked.",
      "After hearing speculation about Cunha and Mbeumo, Man Utd legend Dwight Yorke told gamblingindustrynews.com: “Cunha is a good player. I like him. I like the look of him from his time at Wolves. He will bring some grit and some decisiveness, and a little bit more conviction in the attacking areas, and a greater presence. He’s got a little bit of fire in his belly which is what we need. I like that about him.",
      "“I rate Mbeumo too. He has had an exceptional season this year.  I like Liam Delap too, the lad at Ipswich. I know people talk about him a lot as well.",
      "“These are three good players, and that’s what United need. They need exceptional players to take the club forward. I’m less sure about Mbeumo and Delap, but Cunha has a little bit more about him. He’s the kind of player I want to watch at United, he’s more exciting.",

      "It’s the final Premier League weekend of the season and that means it’s permutations time as the European places are settled, but to be honest we’re far more interested in joining the great big party that’ll be going off at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Liverpool v Crystal Palace\nLook, are there bigger and more important games on this weekend? Yes. Pretty much all of them in one way or another.",
      "But how often do any of us get the chance to watch a Premier League game that is less football match and more massive communal party? It will end with Liverpool receiving the Premier League trophy they won bloody ages ago now by beating a Tottenham team that – and this is impossible to imagine now – was in the grip of a banterously long trophy drought.",
      "But it isn’t just the home team having a big party here, with Crystal Palace also jubilant having sauntered past 50 Premier League points for the first time ever and also if less importantly won the FA Cup to nab their first ever piece of major silverware.",
      "Just a game where a lovely time can be had by all. Get Palace to bring the FA Cup with them. Delay the kick-off because everyone is just too busy giving each other guards of honour.",
      "The (very tenuously semi-) serious point here is that this should be one of the most happily cigars out and flip-flops on football matches ever staged and thus has rich potential to be one of those proper end-of-season games that ends 5-5 or some such silliness, where by the end the delirious fans of both teams are cheering every goal and wondering how on earth they’re going to make it to August with only transfer bumwash and the unwanted Club World Cup to sustain us.",
      "Other sadly untelevised but very live contenders for 5-5 style shenanigans on the final day include but are not limited to: Wolves v Brentford, Fulham v Man City and of course Tottenham v Brighton.",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Nottingham Forest\nBy far the most interesting of the Champions League chasers by simple virtue of novelty, while we also can’t deny we enjoy the fact that the Premier League could send interlopers off to the Big Cup for two years in a row, and those teams both in fact be former winners of said cup from before football was invented.",
      "Alas, a team that had everything safely in their own hands, spending much of the season in the top three, has wobbled sufficiently to leave their chances of a top-five finish now on the slender side.",
      "Even a month ago, Forest were sitting pretty in fourth, with a game in hand that could take them back above Man City and a three-point lead over Chelsea in sixth.",
      "Four games and five points later, they are on the outside looking in. The fact they face Chelsea on the final day is a half-full or half-empty situation depending on how you choose to view it.",
      "While they face undeniably the hardest task of the five teams scrapping for the remaining three places alongside Liverpool, Arsenal and – stop giggling – Tottenham in next season’s Champions League, they do at least know that a win for them automatically takes care of one of the two failures they need from a rival.",
      "If Forest take care of their own business they just need a stumble from Villa or Newcastle. And while Forest’s form has stalled – although it has by no means been a total collapse – they have had enough memorable days at the City Ground this season to believe they can deliver one last blow to the establishment, if only to save Nuno Espirito Santo from another confrontation with an angry iPhone 7-wielding owner.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Ruben Amorim\nOne of the great unique elements about the final day is the vast chasm in importance it can carry for two clubs in the same game.",
      "Sure, your Nottingham Forest v Chelseas are great, all-to-play-for head-to-heads that can determine the success or failure of entire seasons. And we’ve already dispensed with our usual miserabilism to look fondly at the great big party that’s about to go off at Anfield for Premier League winners Liverpool and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace.",
      "But perhaps the most fun final-day games are those between teams still fighting for a big prize and those who have just had their dreams crushed to dirt by the only club in the entire country that might be as ridiculous as they are.",
      "Step forward, Manchester United and their beleaguered life-choices-reconsidering manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The good news for Amorim and the lads is that they will almost certainly avoid the ignominy of finishing 17th even in the very likely event that they cannot rouse themselves from Wednesday night’s disappointment in Bilbao to stop an in-form, Champions League-chasing Aston Villa.",
      "But that’s only because Tottenham’s preparation for their own final game of the season against Brighton has been comprised entirely of memes, full-kit wankering, beer, cigars, parades and settling 17-year-old scores with Domino’s Pizza.",
      "While last-laugh-having Postecoglou faces the challenge of identifying his 11 least hungover players, Amorim and his team face an altogether different kind of headache.",
      "There is a grim fascination to be had in watching just what kind of performance Amorim and United are able to pluck from their arse against a very good side with no thoughts yet of the beach. We have a strong suspicion that the answer is ‘sh*tbone awful’ but, while nothing can be done now to save a season that saw all its remaining eggs trampled under Cristian Romero’s boots on Wednesday, a broken club in utter disarray could do with at least something to send them into the summer with some vague hope that things might be all right in the end.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Cole Palmer\nSympathy for Chelsea is not something generally in great supply, but there is some to be found for Enzo Maresca and his players as they attempt to manage their way through a frankly unprecedented set of circumstances.",
      "As almost everyone else’s season winds down, or in many cases has long since already wound down, the Blues face a decisive Champions League six-pointer at Forest on Sunday, then a European final three days later, and then after a moment to catch their breath head off to the States for the Club World Cup that absolutely everybody definitely wanted and needed and is in no way just a giant player-flogging FIFA cash cow.",
      "In circumstances like these, it is entirely unhelpful for your only real recognised number nine to bag himself a three-game suspension. Nicolas Jackson has done just that, though, and is still out for the vital trip to the City Ground.",
      "With Christopher Nkunku and Marc Guiu also out or at the very best extremely doubtful, the challenge of getting Chelsea over the line here before turning attention to the uncommonly large and important challenges that still await them in this never-ending season falls on the likes of Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho, back in contention here having been ineligible for the win over Manchester United.",
      "It really is a time when Chelsea could do with Palmer stepping up after a Difficult Second Season. Or Difficult Second Half Of Second Season, more fairly.",
      "Last month’s from-behind win at Fulham was, absurdly, Chelsea’s first and only Premier League away win since a 4-3 caper at Tottenham in early December. It’s a 10-game run in which Chelsea have scored only five goals and been shut out six times.",
      "Palmer himself hasn’t scored a Premier League goal away from home since opening the scoring in a 1-1 draw at Palace on the first weekend of January. That came near the end of a run of seven goals in nine Premier League games.",
      "His only goal since that run was a nerve-settling late penalty in the 3-1 win over a partying Liverpool.",
      "Sunday, at a team with the joint best home defensive record in the league, would be a fine time to step up. And unlike at almost every other club in the country, it’s even quite a useful time to get back into form for the further challenges that lie immediately ahead.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Sheffield United v Sunderland\nWe’ve already had a curious taste of a play-off final style game thanks to the unique circumstances that turned this year’s Europa League final into a Champions League play-off, with much attention given to the financial prize on offer and the chance for one of the two teams to spend next season being ritually humiliated at a higher level for which they are painfully ill-equipped and unprepared.",
      "So yeah, nothing at all like the Championship play-off final. Hopefully this will be at least a more watchable and entertaining game than we saw in Bilbao, and the Championship play-off final does traditionally deliver on that front.",
      "There’s no chance of a new club in the Premier League this time around with Sheffield United and Sunderland bidding to join other familiar faces from Leeds and Burnley.",
      "Sunderland would bring the greater novelty having not been seen in the top flight since 2017 and spending a good few years of the interim down in League One, but it’s Sheffield United – automatic promotion contenders for most of the season – who will start as favourites.",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Napoli v Cagliari\nWe generally try to avoid Friday night games but the Serie A title race is clearly the place to go this weekend and that means Friday night lights are our only option as Napoli and Inter scrap it out for the title.",
      "Both slipped up last weekend, leaving Napoli a point clear and with destiny still in their own hands as they seek a second title success in three years. Victory over Cagliari will do the job, delivering Antonio Conte a Serie A title with a third club after also tasting glory with Inter and Juventus.",
      "In a wildly out-of-character move, Conte has fallen out with the suits at Napoli which means this might be a brief yet glorious reign.",
      "Inter travel to Como at the same time on Friday hoping to do all they can to benefit from any further slip-up in Naples.",
      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",

      "",
      "Alex Iwobi – £34m in August 2019",
      "From: Arsenal (5th)\nTo: Everton (8th)",
      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "",
      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",
      "While Manchester United were officially Premier League champions for a little under four more soul-sapping months, their star had already fallen by the time Mata’s helicopter landed at Carrington.",
      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",
      "He would loan Kim Kallstrom later that month in protest.",
      "Mata, on the other hand, will probably forever remain the top scorer of Ryan Giggs’ entire career as a club manager.",
      "",
      "Nemanja Matic – £40m in July 2017\nFrom: Chelsea (1st)\nTo: Manchester United (6th)",
      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester City want to sign a Newcastle star to replace one of their stalwarts for the Club World Cup and beyond.",
      "Mason Mount’s big night in Europe could spark a renaissance, with the Man Utd star and seven more Big Six strugglers set for an upturn next season…",
      "Cole Palmer forgot the golden rule of live TV as he delivered an honest interview in the wake of breaking his Chelsea goal drought.",
      "Jamie Carragher has criticised Chelsea for a poor season and insists ‘they must start satisfying’ Cole Palmer or he’ll leave."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has refused to rule out the prospect of Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 as he’s struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation at Man Utd.",
      "United’s performances under Amorim have been worse than they were during Ten Hag’s tenure as they could still finish 17th in the Premier League this season.",
      "The Red Devils have lost 18 Premier League games this season, while they also came up short in the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League.",

      "This result leaves Man Utd with a limited transfer budget ahead of a season without European football and Amorim remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "Man Utd’s displays under Amorim have been pretty shambolic, but it would still be pretty unfair to sack him before he’s had the opportunity to build a squad that’s more suited to his system.",
      "It has consistently been reported in recent weeks that the head coach would retain Man Utd’s backing even if they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final and this is likely the case, but Romano has not shut the exit door completely.",
      "“The message we are getting from Manchester United is that they stick with the manager. They support the manager,” Romano insisted.",
      "“They believe Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job. So Manchester United’s intention is to continue with Ruben Amorim.",
      "“So unless something completely crazy happens, which is something that sometimes in football can happen after big disappointments, but the clear idea of the club is to continue with Ruben Amorim and to support Ruben Amorim.”",
      "However, a report from The Daily Mail claims Man Utd’s squad are ‘split’ on Amorim amid one main concern.",
      "While it is noted that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the rest of United’s board are ‘standing by’ Amorim, there is a clash ‘over their support of the head coach’ in the dressing room.",
      "It is pointed out that Bruno Fernandes, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot backed Amorim publicly after the loss to Spurs, but other players do not agree.",
      "‘A number of other players feel the 40-year-old is too over-confident in his approach, and cannot understand why he puts so much faith in a playing system that is not suited to the squad he inherited in November.’",
      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",

      "The Red Devils offered little in attack as Spurs comfortably managed to hold their side at bay, with head coach Ruben Amorim under fire for his team selection.",
      "One notable call came as he named Alejandro Garnacho among the substitutes and only brought the winger on for the final 20 minutes.",
      "This angered Garnacho, who has opened the door to an exit in a bombshell interview after being “thrown under the bus” by Amorim.",
      "Reacting to these comments, Jordan blasted the winger, who has been described as a “little weakling”.",

      "Jordan has also predicted Man Utd’s Premier League finish next season, with a “bounce” from 16th expected.",
      "“We’re seeing an erosion and if it keeps going for another ten years, you’re going to see the analogy that I made of Manchester City being Red Bull and Manchester United being Ferrari, being eroded because the next generation of fans are light upon winners and United are not winners,” Jordan added.",
      "“I think we just saw United hit the bottom. You cannot make a case for Manchester United to be finishing 16th in the Premier League, two places above the relegation spot and putting out a performance.",
      "“United were abject and they’ve lost the final in such an abject manner with so much riding on it, so many opportunities to change the direction of travel.",
      "“I think you’ve just witnessed the United beast hit the bottom and then that’s when you start to bounce and I think you’ll see a bounce. Now, what that bounce looks like, it might mean that United finish tenth next season and not 17th.”",

      "“United have remained PSR-compliant until this point, but I think next year was always going to be a bigger challenge, and that’s partly why we’ve seen the club engage in such drastic cost-cutting measures.",

      "Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is set to join Man Utd at the end of the season; United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wants to play for United and SSN has been told the deal is almost agreed",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 21:49, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha’s potential transfer to Manchester United will not be affected by their failure to qualify for European football next season.",
      "United are planning to trigger his £64m release clause but there have been concerns the player might be put off moving after they lost to Tottenham in the Europa League final and missed out on a place in the Champions League next season.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract. The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let [Marcus] Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Scott McTominay played a crucial role in Napoli's Serie A-winning season, scoring 11 goals from midfield; Antonio Conte has got the best out of the Scot, with his numbers better than any season at Old Trafford; McTominay is one of a number of ex-Man Utd players faring better elsewhere",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 22:20, UK",
      "It had to be him. On the crucial final day of the Serie A season, Scott McTominay got Napoli's Serie A title parade going. It has been the story of his and the club's season.",
      "Earlier this campaign, the Scot was asked about what his favourite nickname among the Napoli fanbase is. He was given a selection - and two stood out.",
      "One was 'McFratm'. It's the Neapolitan word for 'brother' - the Napoli faithful now revere the 28-year-old as one of the family.",
      "The other nickname: 'apribottiglie'. It means bottle opener - handed to him due to the sheer number of times he has given Napoli the lead. He gets the party started. He did that when his team needed it most on Friday night, when his team required one win to claim the title.",
      "Nicknames are a big deal at the Naples club. Before his departure to Paris Saint-Germain in January, Kvicha Kvaratskhelia's talents were so unique he earned the term 'Kvaradona'. It's some honour given Diego Maradona's status literally hangs over the club.",
      "But now McTominay is the one with hero status.",
      "And for good reason. Despite Kvaratskhelia's departure, the arrivals of Antonio Conte and Romelu Lukaku to the club over the past year, the Scottish midfielder holds the status of cult hero after delivering them another Scudetto title.",
      "His 18 goal contributions is the most from a midfielder in his Serie A debut season - and three more than Kaka during his first term at AC Milan.",
      "And in Napoli's run-in, McTominay was the bottle opener, starting the scoring in three consecutive league games in April against Empoli, Monza and Torino.",
      "He has been crucial in picking up points during decisive matches all season, scoring in the first game against title rivals Inter - yes, that was an opener too.",
      "And even though Napoli limped over the line for the title during the back end of the season, McTominay more than played his part. He basically carried them through. For example, in the 2-2 draw with Genoa, he set up both goals - again, to put them ahead.",
      "McTominay has been vital in this title-winning team, which some Manchester United fans may struggle to believe. Reliable and consistent? Yes. But two goals behind top scorer Lukaku?",
      "Not everyone is stunned by this. \"How you can sell Scott is beyond me,\" former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said this season. McTominay also scored seven Premier League goals last season and was a penalty area threat under Erik ten Hag.",
      "But his 12 goals this season is one of many key metrics that have gone up since leaving Manchester United.",
      "One of them is minutes. McTominay has been trusted more by Napoli this term than in any season at Old Trafford - and even more so compared to Erik ten Hag's two full seasons at United.",
      "But there has been a position tweak too. At Napoli, McTominay has been handed a more attacking role, similar to his status as a No 10 for Scotland. In the 0-0 draw against Parma last week, he was even handed a role on the left wing - which of course used to be Kvaratskhelia's position.",
      "As a result, McTominay has been even more of an attacking presence. He has created twice as many chances in the league compared to last season at Manchester United.",
      "He takes players on five times as much as last term, while his pressing numbers have multiplied by more than four.",
      "Where was this at Old Trafford? Firstly, there is the feeling that McTominay was misunderstood as a player. The Scot was often used as a deeper midfield option at Old Trafford - sometimes even the deepest.",
      "A period playing as a centre-back for the Scotland national team didn't help United's cause - but how they failed to spot his potential higher up when Steve Clarke pushed him further up to being a regular goal threat.",
      "Of course, Bruno Fernandes was United's standout No 10 in McTominay's prominent years at United. But it only adds to the frustration of letting a talent like McTominay's go. He was not just misunderstood - but also overlooked.",
      "He is not the only United player currently revelling in success elsewhere while Ruben Amorim's side languish in crisis mode. McTominay has a Scudetto title to his name, Antony will take part in next week's Conference League final - which Jadon Sancho could be involved in as well.",
      "Dean Henderson has a FA Cup trophy to his name with Crystal Palace, while Anthony Elanga has justified his move to Nottingham Forest. Marcus Rashford looks better off and sharper at Aston Villa, with Tyrell Malacia a recently-crowned Dutch champion at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "None of the above will hurt more than McTominay though. This was a United academy product - and remember this club has had one of those in every matchday squad since 1937 - winning a major trophy elsewhere, after bidding an emotional goodbye to the club nearly a year ago.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho's futures also up in the air this summer, it will hit home as to whether United is an appropriate development ground for those that come through."

      "Fresh from a 10/1 winner in midweek, our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his Premier League insight across the final round of matches.",
      "Chelsea are the vulnerable ones in the final day race for the Champions League.",
      "Based on their soft underbelly away from home, winning just one of their last 10 Premier League games, this is a great spot for Nottingham Forest.",
      "A criticism of Enzo Maresca this season has been the predictability of Chelsea's play and that is more apparent when you remove Nicholas Jackson from the equation as he does bring a bit of surprise and directness to what Chelsea are trying to serve up. Forest's defensive duo of Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo will fancy their chances of another shutout.",
      "Forest to win to nil is 5/1 with Sky Bet and it's a bet that's landed in seven of their last 15 Premier League home games against the likes of Man City, Man Utd, Spurs, Crystal Palace and Brighton. It's worth a nibble.",
      "But the best bet lies in the shots market.",
      "If you exclude the relegated clubs, only Brentford and West Ham concede more home shots than Nottingham Forest. Marc Cucurella has been one of Chelsea's most consistent operators all season and he comes into this having a shot in 22 of his last 31 appearances, averaging 0.90 shots per-90 across the whole season.",
      "In a game Chelsea need to win, he'll be to the fore of their attacking process and is 10/11 with Sky Bet to have at least one shot.",
      "Over the past 10 seasons, the final day of the Premier League season has averaged 3.41 goals per game - 87 per cent of those matches have featured over 1.5 goals and 65 per cent have delivered over 2.5 goals. Over those 10 years, the average goal on the final matchday increases 0.6 per match from the overall average total goal count per match. That's a big spike.",
      "Teams are more likely to play with a bit more freedom in a no-pressure environment. It's attack-minded football to the fore. And this game just screams a mad scoreline.",
      "Final-day games have the tendency to go into overdrive in terms of a scoreline. Remember Crystal Palace 5-3 Bournemouth in 2019? Or Tottenham 5-4 Leicester in 2018? How about Hull City 1-7 Tottenham in 2017? And there was relegated Southampton drawing 4-4 Liverpool last season.",
      "On the final day it can pay to play the big lines, so over 5.5 goals at 7/2 with Sky Bet is certainly a runner.",
      "Villa are finishing the season like title contenders and this is a fixture sent from heaven for them. You couldn't hand-pick a more welcoming host.",
      "Unai Emery has got Villa so well-drilled. They've won seven of their last eight Premier League games with their only defeat being a last-minute goal at Manchester City. The underlying process has been the best in the entire division over that stretch, especially in defence where their 0.85 expected goals against per 90 is unmatched.",
      "Manchester United are guaranteed their lowest finish since promotion to the top-flight in 1975 and the home fans will be preparing the tomatoes for the lap of honour at the end of the final game.",
      "Villa to win to nil at 9/4 with Sky Bet has a great chance.",
      "Only once in Premier League history has a team entered the final day in a Champions League place and failed to qualify.",
      "Newcastle will be there with a win. A point will be enough if Forest vs Chelsea ends in a draw or Villa fail to win.",
      "Eddie Howe's team are a reliable bunch at home, winning their last six at St James' Park, scoring 20 goals.",
      "If they win this, it will be their most points (41) and most wins (13) at home in a Premier League campaign since 2003. It's hard to see anything but the 1/3 with Sky Bet landing - but how do we get a palatable price? The goalscorer market looks the place to be with Sandro Tonali the standout at 11/2 to score anytime. He has scored three in his last five home games as the Toon faithful do seem to inspire him.",
      "After the season Manchester City have had, is trusting them at 4/7 with Sky Bet to win away from home really a wise decision?",
      "City have won just one away game against teams currently in the top 12, which was a 2-0 win at Chelsea. And Fulham have an impressive home record this season against teams currently in the top nine, winning five of their eight games.",
      "This is officially their best Premier League season so the market is disrespecting them slightly with 4/1 with Sky Bet on offer for the home win.",
      "I'm going to meet in the middle and back the draw at 16/5 with Sky Bet as a point will be enough for City in their Champions League qualification pursuit due to their superior goal difference over Villa.",
      "Spurs at bigger than 3/1 with Sky Bet is a real tempter. The market has gone completely overboard with the hangover factor from midweek and is offering up very tantalising prices on the home win.",
      "Spurs of course have lost 21 of 37 Premier League games but this just might be a bigger game for Ange Postecoglou than what the market is predicting.",
      "You get the impression he really wants to keep this job to try and build this Spurs team. As a manager he isn't going to get an opportunity like this anywhere else with the infrastructure and spending power on offer at Spurs - everything is set there behind the scenes to be a regular challenger.",
      "So, it's in his interest to make sure his team finish the season with a bit of positive momentum to take into those talks with Daniel Levy.",
      "And Brighton don't need to win this match. A point would be enough to finish eighth which gives them an outside chance of Conference League qualification. Brighton's defensive record still worries me too, conceding 16 goals in their last eight games to an expected goals against process of 1.8 per game which is borderline relegation levels of form.",
      "With a high-scoring draw a big runner, the double chance on Spurs at 5/4 with Sky Bet looks a big price.",
      "This has the potential to go down an extreme correct score route, such is the extra possibilities of goals on the final day.",
      "Incredibly though, Bournemouth have only scored more than one goal in just one of their last 13 home matches, which tells you everything you need to know about why they've fallen short in their play to make European football. There has been a huge underperformance at play when assessing their expected goals output though, scoring 13 goals in the last 13 when their expected goals figure is at 21.8.",
      "This might be the game where they bring those metrics closer together and give the Foxes a bit of a battering.",
      "The -2 handicap for Bournemouth makes appeal at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Being wrong is part of the job. It's something anyone in this line of work must accept.",
      "However, tipping Leif Davis to be the top assister in the Premier League at the start of the season at 100/1 turned out to be a new level of wrong. Much like Ipswich on the whole, he has been so disappointing in trying to make the step-up after ripping through League One and the Championship.",
      "He has bagged just two assists this season but there were signs of life from him at Leicester last weekend from an attacking standpoint, having two shots and a goal ruled out. He is 9/4 with Sky Bet to score or assist in a game that should be full of goalmouth action.",
      "Your mind always must be looking ahead in this game and one of the angles I'm most excited about backing next season is Declan Rice's total goals output.",
      "He could become one of Arsenal's top goalscorers next season playing in this attack-minded No 8 role and I'd be a confident backer at any price for him to improve on the total of four he's bagged in the Premier League this season. He is 7/2 with Sky Bet to score for the third league game running at St Mary's.",
      "We saw a little snapshot of Vitor Pereira not holding back in criticising his players in public following the 4-2 defeat to Crystal Palace. He's done some amazing work since joining but doubts remain about whether he can rein in his combustible nature to make his tenure one that will work in the longer term.",
      "It's hard to see how Wolves can stop Brentford scoring multiple goals in this one.",
      "The over 3.5 goals line looks attractive at 5/4 with Sky Bet, as does Yoane Wissa scoring at 11/8. The striker has landed for punters in this market in five of his last six games and has shown this season that there are few better around than him in front of goal in the Premier League. He can get his 20th goal of the campaign.",

      "The Radar column also looks at the plight of Raheem Sterling as his former Man City team-mate Kevin De Bruyne offers a reminder of just how good he was, plus why Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze is one of the Premier League's best players to watch",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 16:09, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Man Utd's Amorim faith👍 De Bruyne's Sterling appreciation🦅 Eze's Crystal Palace scoring run",
      "There was a huge contrast in the messaging from the two managers in the press conference room at San Mames following Manchester United's Europa League final loss to Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Shortly before Ange Postecoglou, of all people, came in, winner's medal around his neck, and spoke about the importance of adapting his approach, Ruben Amorim had sat in the same seat and said the opposite: \"I will not change anything in the way I do things.\"",
      "Amorim's way of doing things brought him considerable success in Portugal, of course, and Manchester United knew what they were getting when they hired him. The former Sporting boss arrived having used a back three in 188 consecutive league and European games. Six months on, that number stands at 225.",
      "But his defiance still felt jarring in the context of his 17th defeat in 41 games as Manchester United's head coach. It also brought into sharp focus the dilemma now facing the club.",
      "Wednesday's defeat, by far the costliest of a miserable campaign given the financial implications of missing out on a Champions League spot, was yet another reminder that the vast majority of Amorim's players are unsuited to his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "It is clear that extensive changes are required to equip him with the players he needs to have a chance of making it work. But they will not come cheaply. That is problematic given the potential impact of no European football on the club's already-fraught finances.",
      "Besides, there is no guarantee the changes would bring success. Have the club's decision-makers seen enough in the last six months to suggest the level of investment required is worth the risk? Results have actually worsened since Amorim's appointment.",
      "They are banking on a drastic change of fortunes but they also have to consider where an expensive round of recruitment tailored to Amorim's specific set-up would leave them when he eventually goes.",
      "What use are expensively acquired wing-backs to a potential successor who prefers a back four? What use are narrow No 10s to one who favours touchline-hugging wingers?",
      "The accepted wisdom is that Manchester United need to break the cycle of signing players for specific managers then ripping up and starting again when a change is required. But the worry is that minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe now risks perpetuating it.",
      "Amorim is not alone in using a back three, of course. But he is certainly in a minority among managers. Across all Premier League games this season, back fours have been used 77 per cent of the time, with back threes only used 23 per cent of the time.",
      "The same disparity can be seen in Europe. Simone Inzaghi may yet win the Champions League with a back three but Inter Milan are one of only two sides to reach this season's knockout stages who habitually use a three over four, the other being Amorim's former club Sporting, who are already onto their second appointment since his exit, with Rui Borges having replaced Joao Pereira.",
      "It is not that the system cannot work, it is just that the pool of potential successors to Amorim who actually use it is a small one. While Manchester United appear committed to their man, with no plans to make a change, the reality is that the moment will come, and it might be sooner than they hope.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta gave Kieran Tierney and Jorginho the chance to say goodbye to the Emirates Stadium with late cameos in last Sunday's 1-0 win over Newcastle but Raheem Sterling, another player set to depart this summer, was an unused substitute.",
      "It remains to be seen whether he will get any minutes at Southampton on the final day but, having been unable to make a mark during his loan spell from Chelsea, he looked a slightly incongruous presence during Arsenal's lap of appreciation.",
      "With more than 600 senior games in his legs, Sterling is approaching the twilight of his career at 30 but there was a reminder of just how special he was this week when Kevin De Bruyne picked him out as his favourite team-mate during an interview with Jamie Redknapp.",
      "Those runs have become increasingly rare. Sterling's playing time has dropped to a new low this season. Arsenal fans haven't seen him at anything close to his best and neither have those of Chelsea, where he still has a year left to run on his contract.",
      "Sterling is unlikely to ever get a send-off like his former team-mate De Bruyne but his outstanding achievements, as a player who ranks among the Premier League's top 20 for both goals and assists, with 123 and 65 respectively in 395 games, should not be forgotten even as his powers wane.",
      "Eberechi Eze was given most of the evening off against Wolves on Tuesday following his match-winning heroics in Crystal Palace's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City but he still made his mark, adding a superb fourth goal only five minutes after his introduction.",
      "Attention will soon turn to his future. He will not be short of suitors this summer. But for now, provided he is not playing against your team, it is best to just enjoy a player flourishing into one of the Premier League's best. He has been a pleasure to watch this season.",
      "Bruno Guimaraes' completeness was the focus of last week's column. There was also a look at how Arsenal have missed Kai Havertz and the importance of Mikkel Damsgaard's pressing to Brentford."

      "\"We're all gutted, it's not how we saw the outcome to be honest,\" Shaw said. \"But it's not just tonight, this whole season, it's been nowhere near good enough. I think all of us have to question ourselves on if we're good enough to be here.",
      "\"For a team like Manchester [United], for the season we've had, it's not acceptable. We know that, we all know that, I know that. It's not where Manchester [United] should be.\"",

      "When a player breaks the record for goal involvements in a 38-game Premier League season and fires his team to the title, it makes this category pretty routine. Step forward, Mo Salah.",
      "The Liverpool star has taken his game to new levels at the age of 32, posting career-best figures for assists to go with his huge haul of goals. Yes, Virgil van Dijk has been imperious at the back, yes, Alexander Isak and Declan Rice have shone for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively.",
      "But Salah has been involved in over 54 per cent of Liverpool's goals. Simply, they wouldn't have won the title without him.Peter Smith",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo needs an honourable mention here. Nottingham Forest were tipped by some for relegation, but he has led them to the European places. If the season ends in Champions League qualification, it would have been an incredible campaign for the Nottingham Forest boss.",
      "Eddie Howe is also a worthy candidate after leading Newcastle United to Carabao Cup glory and potentially the Champions League, but it's hard to look past Arne Slot.",
      "Many thought there'd be a drop off from Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp's exit, but testament to the job Slot has done at Anfield, there hasn't been.",
      "His first season in English football has ended in the title, which is an incredible achievement.Oliver Yew",
      "Nikola Milenkovic has had an incredible debut season for Forest. The £12m summer signing has been instrumental under Nuno and fans have marvelled at the brilliant partnership he's forged with fellow centre-back Murillo.",
      "Milenkovic ranks inside the top five for duel success both on the ground and in the air, mixing with likes of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate.",
      "The 27-year-old Serbia international has also bagged four goals for Forest this season, just pipping Dean Huijsen who shone in his brief but fantastic spell at Bournemouth.Emilie Mwanza",
      "It became pretty obvious after Myles Lewis-Skelly's full Arsenal debut that he would go on to become something big.",
      "The teenage left-back's first Gunners start came in December but there was just something about him - his football arrogance, his ability to take the ball under pressure without fear or error and his consistency.",
      "Since then, he has become first-choice in that role and with England's left-back role at his feet too - a meteoric and unchallenged rise.",
      "And there is more to come - expect Lewis-Skelly to transition into midfield in the coming years.Sam Blitz",
      "Last season's top two, Man City and Arsenal, served up a pair of contrasting classics, starting with a bad-tempered, but intriguing four-goal classic at the Etihad in September that appeared to be going the visitors' way - that is, until John Stones's scrambled 98th-minute equaliser sent the home fans crazy, while breaking Gunners' hearts after almost holding on for the win since half-time with just 10 players.",
      "The return meeting at the Emirates in February may have lacked that tension, but the quality of Arsenal's five-star display that ripped the champions apart more than made up for it, with young left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly showing just why we selected him as our Young Player of the Year.",
      "However, our game of the season features the champions, although it is not their drama-filled 2-2 draw in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in February when James Tarkowski thundered home a 98th-minute equaliser that made the famous old ground shake.",
      "Rather it is Liverpool's visit to Newcastle United in early December that was this campaign's standout match and not just because it finished 3-3! The clash in the north east had all the ingredients that make up a classic, being played under the St James' Park lights, producing an electric atmosphere as a result, and plenty of goals, including a contender for strike of the season from Magpies forward Alexander Isak and then late drama when the hosts levelled matters.",
      "All in all, a real feast of football to showcase the brilliance of the Premier League.Rich Morgan",
      "\"The touch is as good as anything we will see in the Premier League this season. It's Messi-like.\"",
      "The touch to bring Bart Verbruggen's long punt downfield is sublime, the turn and change of direction to create space for the shot is sensational, and the whipped finish into the bottom corner rounded off a special Premier League moment.Oliver Yew",
      "Matz Sels and David Raya have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League goalkeeper this season, so it should be of no surprise to see their names featuring heavily in this category.",
      "In fact, Sels' player-of-the-match performance to prevent Liverpool from taking all three points at Nottingham Forest in January features several world-class stops that all came under consideration.",
      "There were several other saves that caught the eye during the season, such as Emi Martinez displaying ridiculous reactions to prevent Chris Wood's header from crossing the line at the City Ground in December, Andre Onana diving full length to deny Crystal Palace's Ismaila Sarr and Alphonse Areola somehow keeping out Mohamed Salah's close-range strike at the London Stadium before Christmas.",
      "However, the nod goes to the aforementioned Raya, who helped Arsenal inflict on Aston Villa their only home loss in the league this season with a simply ridiculous second-half stop to keep out Ollie Watkins' header.",
      "The Arsenal No 1 first had to touch Amadou Onana's deflected shot on to the bar, before immediately springing back up to his feet and pushing away to safety the England striker's point-blank header, with Gary Neville exclaiming on commentary: \"How Raya reacts, wow!\"Rich Morgan",
      "A moment that will live forever in history. James Tarkowski crashing in a 98th-minute equaliser in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Forty-one wins apiece for Everton and Liverpool at the Grand Old Lady. Forever. Hit play on our video above and drink in those extraordinary scenes again...Peter Smith",
      "Too many to choose from. The Man Utd head coach has been relegation-level on the pitch, but Quadruple-winning in the press conference room.",
      "\"We're maybe the worst team in the history of Man Utd,\" wins it though. That came in January after a loss to Brighton. Nobody actually expected him to follow through with it though…Sam Blitz",
      "A season of profit has been secured for the fifth season running with the best bets advised in the column leading to +18.7. It's been a bumpy ride involving near misses and losing runs but the winners have flowed nicely. A spell of betting against Manchester City at short prices before it was trendy to do so made me look very clever indeed, correctly calling wins for Tottenham (0-4), Bournemouth (2-1) and Brighton (2-1) during City's mid-season wobble was a memorable spell.",
      "There have been longshot treble wins at 10/1 and 14/1 - a particular highlight was Joelinton's card for Newcastle at Aston Villa copping the treble after Brentford beat Brighton and Palace and Bournemouth sailed under the 2.5 goals line in a 0-0 draw.",
      "And we've finished the season strongly, nailing a lovely 10/1 winning angle on 32+ fouls being committed in the Europa League final.Lewis Jones",
      "Learning to accept being wrong is a key part of keeping a sane headspace when it comes to making betting decisions and putting your neck on the line. And I've had plenty of practice this season.",
      "Let's start with Tottenham to finish in the top four and Dominic Solanke to score 20 or more goals shall we at 12/1? Or what about Leif Davis - the Ipswich assist-king of a full back - who I was excited about in the top assist markets in pre-season at 100/1? Just one assist was it Leif? Ah well.",
      "In fact, my reading for most of the season on the newly-promoted teams was downright ugly. Thinking Leicester were a \"barnstorming price\" to beat Everton at Goodison Park at 7/2 quickly went down the drain after just 10 seconds when Abdoulaye Doucoure sent the hosts on their way to the most comfortable 4-0 win you're ever likely to see.Lewis Jones"

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 06:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."
