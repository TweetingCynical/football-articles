      "Pep Guardiola was in no doubt(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "A solemn Pep Guardiola was forced to admit that Manchester United deserved to win Saturday's derby - and refused to blame VAR for City's loss. United ran out 2-0 winners at Old Trafford, as the hosts started Michael Carrick's reign as manager with a bang.",
      "Guardiola's side were underwhelming and have now gone four Premier League games without a win. Second-half from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu made the difference, although the margin of victory could've been much higher.",
      "The game could've also been changed by an early refereeing decision. Diogo Dalot was shown a yellow card by Anthony Taylor for a foul on Jeremy Doku in the opening stages, and replays showed that he'd made contact high on the City winger's leg with his studs.",
      "However, VAR ruled the contact to have been 'glancing' and without 'excessive force'. The United right-back was allowed to continue and helped the Red Devils to a stunning victory.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end and of course the goals we conceded were poor. We didn't control, but in general we can't talk about this action or that action. We have the duty to analyse the game in general and they were better.\"",
      "On the decision not to send Dalot off, Guardiola added: \"You could say that, you could say that red card, different game. Many, many situations happen.",
      "\"It is easy for me to come here and say it should be a red card. It is not about that, we will not grow up if that is the argument to win or lose a game. You have to do better and we didn't today.\"",

      "Carrick is hoping to get the results he needs to stand a chance of securing the job on a permanent basis. And he added: \"I think the players fed off it. The players left the dressing room unbelievably desperate to do well.",

The Red Devils entered the match seeking their first victory of 2026, following draws against Burnley and Leeds United, as well as being dumped out of the FA Cup at the first hurdle against Brighton & Hove Albion.",

      "On their podcast, the pair dismissed the notion that the former Ajax star could handle City's Erling Haaland due to the significant size difference between them. But Martinez was a stalwart in defence for Carrick's team, successfully neutralising the threat posed by Haaland.",

      "Phil Foden may have suffered an injury against Manchester United(Image: PA Wire)",
      "Pep Guardiola has denied claims Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden suffered a broken hand after falling awkwardly on it against Manchester United. Towards the end of the first half, the England international fell down and broke his fall with his hand.",
      "It was an uncomfortable landing and when Guardiola's side emerged for the second half, Foden was nowhere to be seen. He was taken off for summer signing Rayan Cherki.",
      "After the match, speculation started doing the rounds suggesting he may have suffered a hand injury. This would have rubbed salt into a torrid afternoon which ended with United beating Guardiola's side 2-0, handing a much needed victory to the Red Devils' new interim manager Michael Carrick.",
      "When Foden went down the tunnel at half-time, he was accompanied by a member of City's medical team. His arm could be seen propped up in a set position, suggesting they were trying to protect it.",
      "However, Guardiola has played down reports Foden may have broken his hand. When asked if Foden had suffered an injury, the ex-Barcelona manager quickly replied: \"No, I don't think so.\"",
      "If it had been a serious injury, it would have come at an awkward time for Foden, with the World Cup on the horizon and only six months to prove to England manager Thomas Tuchel he is the one who should be orchestrating England's midfield.",
      "Foden has enjoyed an improved campaign compared to last season, helping himself to seven goals and two assists in 20 Premier League appearances. However, he is also competing for the No. 10 spot against Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer, Morgan Rogers and Eberechi Eze.",
      "Foden did not emerge for the second half(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Foden was called up to the last international squad and contributed an assist in the 2-0 home victory over Serbia. The next international break will surely be crucial when it comes to informing Tuchel's decision for this summer's World Cup in the USA, Mexico and Canada.",
      "England face Uruguay and Japan in international friendlies at Wembley Stadium at the end of March. However, the more pressing issue for City as a whole is the fact they are losing even more ground on Arsenal.",
      "Before the derby at Old Trafford, they were six points away from Premier League leaders Arsenal. They are in danger of finishing the weekend nine points behind Mikel Arteta's side with 16 matches left to play.",
      "Patrick Dorgu scored the vital second after Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "After the match, City midfielder Bernardo Silva said: \"They deserved to win today. They had more energy and intention. It always felt like they were close to scoring and we were never there.",
      "“We gave them what they want. They took the game to where they are good and we are not so good. Since I arrived here in England we have always been a very controlled team.",
      "\"There was a lot of things missing from us. Definitely a bad day for us. It is a big gap [to Arsenal], we won’t lie and say it isn’t a big gap it is. We will fight until the end.”",

      "Michael Carrick enjoyed a dream start to his Manchester United reign(Image: Carl Recine)",
      "With his knee bloodied after another tangle with Erling Haaland, Harry Maguire limped back into his own penalty area to help defend the free-kick he had conceded.",
      "Moments later, he was producing a towering header to set up the counter-attack that ended with Bryan Mbeumo giving Michael Carrick a dream start to his 17-game Manchester United audition.",
      "The dream start became fantasy as Patrick Dorgu doubled the delirium before Old Trafford was treated to the symbolic sight of Haaland’s misery being ended by Pep Guardiola. For United, that was just one beautiful moment on a beautiful afternoon.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in town and one match into his tenure, Carrick has already made a compelling case to get the gig for next season. Seriously.",
      "And Maguire’s performance magnificently typified the response Carrick got from Manchester United’s players. Quite simply, they were more aggressive, more determined, more passionate, more committed than a Manchester City team that, at times, looked as though they did not believe a serious title race was still in progress.",
      "United were fantastic, City were a pale imitation of themselves. As belligerent and as bold as Maguire and his team-mates were, Guardiola’s men were meek and weak.",
      "The lamentable defending that gifted Dorgu United’s second goal had been a constant theme throughout the contest. City enjoyed just under 70 percent of the possession - and did precisely nothing with it. Gianluigi Donnarumma was City’s best player, telling you all you need to know.",
      "But this was all about United’s vibrancy and desire under their new manager. If Carrick wanted a reaction in terms of aggression, he certainly got it. But it should have come at a cost, Diogo Dalot’s knee-high stamp on Jeremy Doku seemingly a no-brainer for VAR Craig Pawson to upgrade to a red.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu were on target for Manchester United in the derby(Image: Copa)",
      "It seems Pawson believed there was not sufficient intent, which was odd considering the United full-back was clearly not trying to stamp on the ball, which had long disappeared. And the official explanation was that the contact was glancing. So there you have it, Dalot needs to make better contact when he is trying to injure someone next time.",
      "Yes, as everyone keeps saying, VAR is here to stay but those operating the system are not helping themselves right now.",
      "If Dalot’s misdemeanour was a negative trait of United’s commitment, there was an absolute welter of positives. There was a simpler, faster, more direct approach to United’s style, the emphasis being on getting it out to wide areas quickly.",
      "And while City, predictably, had the majority of the ball, United were always the more dangerous side, with Maguire heading against the crossbar and Mbeumo half-asleep when presented with a sitter. There were also two efforts - from Amad and from Bruno Fernandes - that were ruled out by narrow offside verdicts.",
      "City might have had a touch more panache, United had more passion. In fact, Carrick spent a good deal of the proceedings urging his players to calm down. But as long as Dalot kept a lid on his antics, there was no need to calm down. United were full of zest, City were almost bizarrely subdued.",
      "Guardiola clearly was not happy with what he was watching and withdrew Phil Foden and Max Alleyne at the break. But the introduction of Rayan Cherki and Nico O’Reilly did not give City the injection of urgency they needed.",
      "Not far off an hour had elapsed before Haaland made his first meaningful contribution, a shot blocked by Lisandro Martinez. To put it in basic terms, Haaland had an awful game. Pretty much every time the ball reached Haaland, it was surrendered and in the end, Guardiola raised the white flag for him.",
      "To say the entire City team raised the white flag would be harsh. It would certainly do United an injustice. It would certainly do Carrick an injustice.",
      "And if Sir Jim replaced that short-term deal with a proper one right now, you would not blame him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Thomas Tuchel is believed to be amongst the frontrunners for the Manchester United head coach's position as the club searches for a new permanent boss from this summer – and Wayne Rooney has previously made his admiration for the current England manager clear.",
      "United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach on an interim basis to steer the side through to the end of the campaign after Ruben Amorim's abrupt exit. It appears there are no plans for Carrick to continue in the position beyond the current season at present, although he got off to the perfect start with a 2-0 win over Manchester City at Old Trafford.",
      "The club are instead pursuing a vastly experienced manager capable of rejuvenating the Premier League heavyweights. Oliver Glasner has been mentioned in connection with the vacancy, a link strengthened by the Crystal Palace manager confirming this term would be his final one at Selhurst Park.",
      "Yet according to The i Paper, United's decision-makers are not pursuing the Palace chief and have instead turned their attention towards two ex-Premier League managers - Tuchel and Robert De Zerbi. Old Trafford icon Rooney has already voiced his preference for appointing the England boss.",
      "Speaking on the Wayne Rooney Show, he said: \"Xabi Alonso did incredible at (Bayer) Leverkusen and I think you have more chance of him sitting and waiting and hoping with (Liverpool manager Arne) Slot.",
      "\"Tuchel is the one for me. He knows the Premier League, has won trophies. He is doing well at England. Time will tell.\"",
      "Before taking the reins of the England team last year, Tuchel had been at the helm of three of Europe's footballing giants - Paris Saint Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich. The 52 year old clinched major trophies with each club.",
      "Thomas Tuchel's England contract runs until the 2026 World Cup(Image: Getty Images)",
      "During his tenure at Chelsea, Tuchel famously led the team to Champions League glory in a final against Manchester City, as well as securing the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. He then swapped Stamford Bridge for Bayern Munich, where he lifted the Bundesliga title.",
      "Prior to his stints at Chelsea and Bayern, Tuchel made waves in France with PSG. He bagged two league titles, the French Cup, the French League Cup and secured a runner-up spot in the Champions League.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "While these accomplishments have certainly caught Rooney's eye, Tuchel's biggest test could be on the horizon this summer as he gears up to guide England at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The German has had a promising start with the Three Lions, and his future may hinge on how England fare at the tournament, with the team considered among the favourites.",
      "Tuchel isn't the only one being linked with the soon-to-be vacant United job. Luis Enrique's name has also been floated, although the current PSG boss is expected to stay put in France.",
      "Former Brighton manager De Zerbi is reportedly another prime candidate. Now managing Marseille, the Italian has had a successful run, boasting a 58 per cent win rate from 62 matches, compared to Amorim's 40 per cent at United.",
      "For the time being, Carrick is at the helm. Ahead of Saturday's Manchester derby, the ex-midfielder set out his goals for the season, stating: \"Not in terms of it has to be this or that way. Like I said, we want to be near the top. But we have to take some small steps toward that and European football would a step toward that.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu were on target for Manchester United in the derby(Image: Copa)",
      "A second half one-two from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu gave Michael Carrick the perfect start to his stint in the Manchester United hotseat as the Red Devils clinched a statement victory over City in the derby.",
      "United started like a house on fire and should have taken the lead through Harry Maguire, who could only head against the crossbar from yards out after just three minutes. More chances came for both sides, including a disallowed goal for Amad, before Bruno Fernandes' fine fun and composed finish was chalked off by the officials, the Portugal international offside by a toe.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma produced a world-class double save minutes into the second half to thwart Amad and Casemiro in quick succession, but Mbeumo did find a way to beat the imperious Italian with a fine low strike just after the hour mark.",
      "Dorgu, impressive again in a more attacking role, made the result safe in the 76th minute to clinch the bragging rights on for the red half of Manchester on a derby day they will remember for quite some time.",
      "The derby was Michael Carrick's first game as Manchester United head coach(Image: Darren Staples/AFP)",
      "A Manchester derby was billed as somewhat of a baptism of fire for Manchester United's new head coach, but it was the hosts who looked the most dangerous in the first half. Maguire's point-blank header ballooned back off the bar in the early minutes and there were further golden chances for Mbeumo and Amad before the latter and Bruno Fernandes both saw goals chalked off for VAR.",
      "United had the better chances in both halves and were good value for their goal when it finally arrived courtesy of Mbeumo. Dorgu made it comfortable not long after to lift the roof from Old Trafford and was no less than United deserved.",
      "This was a statement win for United and Carrick, who could hardly have dreamt of a better start. Nobody will be getting carried away off the back of one 90 minutes. But how United acquitted themselves against a City side many expect to go on and reclaim the Premier League title is definitely cause for optimism.",
      "Gianluigi Donnaromma celebrates after a stunning double save(Image: Darren Staples/AFP)",
      "Donnarumma arrived in the Premier League with a pristine reputation and he showed why he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world in the derby.",
      "He kept United at bay in the first half and his double stop to keep out efforts from Amad and Casemiro after the break was pure quality.",
      "City are light at the back and the impending addition of Marc Guehi will see their title odds shorten for good reason. It wasn't Donnarumma's day today, but the City keeper didn't deserve to end up on the losing side.",
      "Diogo Dalot avoided a red card for this tackle(Image: )",
      "As much as the first half was full of positives for United, they were fortunate to end it with 11 men following Diogo Dalot's poor challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "The Portugal international's foot was high and reckless and left Doku in agony after going right across his knee. VAR deemed it only worthy of a yellow card - just like referee Anthony Taylor. But it should have been red and Dalot was incredibly fortunate not to walk.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was recalled to Manchester United's starting XI for the derby by Michael Carrick(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United FC)",
      "Ostracised by Ruben Amorim, it was no great surprise to see Mainoo back in from the start under Carrick given his dearth of minutes this term has sparked a mix of anger and confusion from fans.",
      "His inclusion here would indicate that he is in line for a more significant role during the second half of the season. And on a day where United fans were given plenty to shout about, that's another big plus.",
      "Arsenal must be sick of the sight of Manchester City. After denying them titles in successive years before Liverpool's triumph last year, Pep Guardiola's men have been on the charge in recent weeks again, applying the pressure on the league leaders.",
      "But defeat in the derby means Arsenal open up a nine-point lead over City if they beat Nottingham Forest in their game, which would leave Guardiola and Co with a mountain to climb.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has come out in defence of Jonny Evans following Roy Keane's criticism of Manchester United for appointing the former defender as a first‑team coach. This week, Keane questioned Evans' arrival on Michael Carrick's coaching staff, claiming he isn't qualified enough in a brutal rant.",
      "\"Fletch goes and Carrick gives him the job. Great, isn't it?,\" Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast. \"We should all go to Barbados for a week… If you're on about getting coaching staff in, we're praising one of them and we just let the other two go - Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans. What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach at Man Utd's first team? He left a job four weeks ago as a loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?”",
      "Keane launched his rant after Gary Neville expressed his satisfaction with Steve Holland's appointment as Carrick's assistant coach. \"I wish we were sitting here and you said he brought three staff in and you reeled them off and said they’re all brilliant,\" Keane added. \"You said you don’t know anything about Jonny Evans coaching because he's never coached! That's my point! But he's gone into Man Utd and you're going, 'oh that’s okay because we’ve got Stevie Holland,' A new guru!\"",
      "Since Keane's comments, Ferdinand has argued that Evans deserved his opportunity, insisting the former defender knows the squad well, having played alongside nearly every player - and could help Carrick get the best out of the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"The stuff with the coaches and stuff like that, and calling out the coaches, like, Jonny Evans is a young coach. Why shouldn't he get a chance?,\" Ferdinand said on BBC 5 Live.",
      "\"Why shouldn't he get a chance to come into the club? He knows every single player in that club better than any coach on the planet right now, other than the ones that have been there recently, because he's played there. He knows them all. Why wouldn't you bring him on your staff? I don't understand. If you want to get to know what Kobbie Mainoo is like, because you want to reboot him and put him in a team, I wouldn't mind having somebody that knows him, who's been in the changing room, who knows how he works, closer to me.",

      "Marcus Rashford during Racing Santander vs Barcelona(Image: Quality Sport Images, Getty Images)",
      "Marcus Rashford has been turning heads during his loan stint at Barcelona but ex-Barca ace Gary Lineker fears the England star might find it tough to reclaim his starting spot from the in-form Raphinha. Rashford, who moved to Barca on a season-long loan from Manchester United with an option for a permanent deal in the summer, only saw 32 minutes of action across two SuperCopa matches in Saudi Arabia as Hansi Flick's side won the trophy.",
      "Rashford was brought on for the last 25 minutes of the semi-final victory over Athletic Club with his team already leading 5-0. Raphinha, starting in Rashford's favoured spot on the left, contributed two goals and an assist before adding another brace in the final triumph over Real Madrid - a game in which Rashford was only handed seven minutes by manager Flick.",
      "The German boss' use of Rashford in recent weeks may well feel like a statement on where he sees Rashford in the hierarchy. There's still a place for the Englishman in the squad but perhaps not in the manager's strongest XI.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford, he didn't come on until quite late on,\" Lineker said on The Rest is Football. \"I did see a thing from the club saying they're very pleased with the way Marcus has settled in. I know he didn't get much of a look in in the Super Cup... [and] he came on just after half-time in the other game in the Super Cup against Athletic.",
      "\"With Raphinha in that sort of form, it's going to be difficult for him to play too much football. But then, as we saw in the first half of the season, Lamine Yamal was injured for a spell, [Robert] Lewandowski was injured for a spell, Raphinha was injured for a spell. They can see that he's doing really well and apparently they want to see if they can negotiate with Manchester United.\"",
      "Fellow presenter Alex Aljoe suggested Rashford wouldn't make it into Barcelona's strongest line-up for the big matches, at least on current form. However, both she and Gary Lineker believe the forward will still have a role to play as manager Flick makes full use of his squad.",
      "\"There's no real drop-off particularly with the players that they've got, particularly in those front positions,\" Lineker said. \"So I think he'll (Rashford) play plenty of football and he seems really happy there.\"",
      "This season, Rashford has contributed seven goals and 11 assists in 28 appearances at a rate of one goal involvement for every 95 minutes on the pitch. His standout performances include a brace in a Champions League victory over Newcastle United and two goals plus an assist as Barca ran riot against 10-man Olympiacos.",
      "Raphinha's recent form has made it tough for Rashford to start matches(Image: Yasser Bakhsh, Getty Images)",
      "After a run of substitute outings around the turn of the year, the England star was included in Flick's starting XI for the Copa del Rey round of 16 match against Racing Santander. The Catalan club secured a 2-0 win thanks to goals from Ferran Torres and Lamine Yamal, while rivals Real Madrid suffered a surprise defeat against second-tier Albacete.",
      "Rashford's performances at Barcelona have also caught the attention of England manager Thomas Tuchel. The forward was part of the Three Lions' camp for the September, October and November international breaks, scoring in a 5-0 victory in Serbia and assisting one of Harry Kane's two goals in a 2-0 win away to Albania.",
      "\"He can be one of the best in the world because of the quality I see in training, the finishing with both legs and with the head,\" Tuchel said of Rashford in October. \"He is explosive, he is fast, he is strong in the air, so where are the limits?\".",
      "\"There are no limits - but the numbers don't reach the potential. He needs to push himself into goal involvements, that means goals and assists, it is as easy as that.\"",

      "He went on to further question the appointment of Evans to the first team coaching staff, having heavily criticised the decision earlier in the week. The former defender's return comes just months after he left his role as loans manager.",
      "\"It's not an issue with Jonny Evans, it's more an issue with the club, the decision-making, who they're bringing in. Jonny Evans left Manchester United about four, five, six weeks ago right?",
      "Mirror Man Utd - FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"Leaves a month ago, had enough of doing that, he wasn't there for ten years doing it, a few months. United are letting 100s of people go, staff, every week, but Jonny walks away from that job. Gets called a week later, Darren Fletcher.",
      "\"My issue with Jonny, he's got no coaching, it's not as if he's worked in the academy for a few years.",
      "\"So Jonny gets a phone call, having left as loans manager, 'do you want to come back?' I bet Jonny's thinking, 'what as the kit manager or am I working with the U12s?' 'No, you're coming back with the first team to work under Darren'.",
      "\"Obviously a great opportunity for him, they have two games, don't go too well, that's probably the end of that. Another manager coming in, he wants you to stay on as well.\"",
      "When asked if he would have gone to help United, he replied with: \"It would probably be no, I don't want to work with people above me who are dictating who your staff are, telling you what players to bring in.",
      "\"There's been chaos going on in the background. I'm not saying the previous manager hasn't helped himself, but I guarantee one day he'll come out and say there were decisions made I wasn't happy with.\"",
      "His rant again touched on the appointment of Carrick in a debate with fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge. When Sturridge said that Carrick can be a success if he gets United playing attacking football, Keane fired back: \"Of course he can, you're stating the obvious.",
      "\"I'm agreeing with you, that can happen. But I'm not sure at this club, with the decisions being made above for these staff, and the staff he's coming in with.",
      "\"Wilcox, whoever is making the decisions, people talk about looking for yes men, there's a lot of manager out there who are yes men.",
      "\"We do Sky every week and we're talking about Man United, the greatest club in the world, the biggest, but all of a sudden we're going to take a gamble on a manager who hasn't got a track record and his staff haven't got a track record.\"",

      "A former Manchester United star reflected on his transfer saga(Image: Shaun Botterill, Getty Images)",
      "Dimitar Berbatov has revealed how easy he found it to turn down Manchester City in favour of joining Manchester United. The two clubs are set to reignite their rivalry in the Manchester derby this weekend.",
      "Berbatov, 44, became United's record signing in 2008 when he arrived from Tottenham Hotspur in a £30million transfer. Having previously established himself as a prolific goalscorer at Bayer Leverkusen, the Bulgarian scored 46 times in 102 appearances for Spurs.",
      "His knack for finding the net attracted attention from multiple clubs during the transfer window, including City, who had just been bought by Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour. The takeover marked the start of what would become a period of dominance in the blue half of Manchester.",
      "However, at that point, United remained the top power in English football. Sir Alex Ferguson's side were recruiting from a position of strength after securing a Premier League and Champions League double. Berbatov chose to join United, later confessing that the decision was not a difficult one.",
      "\"Look at the shirt: the red, the gold, the badge. The history, the manager, the players, the trophies,\" Berbatov said during his appearance on BT Sport's What I Wore. \"Back in the day, there was no comparison [between Man Utd and Man City].",
      "\"There was no second-guessing or choice to be made. Just one [team]. In my mind, this was the moment to make, maybe, the last step on my mountain... my personal top.\"",
      "The chance to line up alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney proved irresistible for Berbatov when deciding to join United. \"One of the reasons I wanted to be part of this team is because of the players,\" he explained.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to play with players like [Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez]? You want to be there and be part of that team. You want to test yourself against the best players.",
      "Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney enjoyed a good partnership at Man United (Image: Photo by Ian Walton/Getty Images)",
      "\"It was challenging, it was fun – of course, you need to have fun along the way. And you need to hold your own – if somebody yells at you, yell back. Otherwise, they're going to walk all over you. You need to show how strong you are.",
      "\"The mentality was different because we are talking about a winning team. You fight between each other...scream, yell and curse...but everything is about the win. You stop...the training session or the game, and it stays on the pitch.\"",
      "Dimitar Berbatov poses with the Premier League title in 2009(Image: Photo by John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "During his four-year spell at Old Trafford, Berbatov netted 56 times in 149 appearances, claiming two Premier League titles. Beyond sharing the Golden Boot with former teammate Carlos Tevez in the 2010/11 season, he guided United to Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011, though both ended in defeat against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona.",
      "The Premier League icon will likely be watching the Manchester derby on Saturday as new United caretaker boss Michael Carrick takes charge of his first match. Meanwhile, City will be hoping to close the gap to Arsenal in the title race as well as looking to leave Old Trafford with bragging rights.",

      "Ruben Amorim with Kobbie Mainoo during the 2024/25 Europa League(Image: PA)",
      "Former Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim may have been hesitant to deploy Kobbie Mainoo during his tenure but he never completely dismissed the midfielder's potential. Amorim's tactical system seemingly offered little room for Mainoo, as the boss didn't consider him the ideal partner for Bruno Fernandes in a midfield pairing.",
      "Amorim's spell at Old Trafford was brought to a premature end earlier this month, with his final fixture coming against Leeds United at Elland Road. Mainoo was absent through injury for that match, having also missed the previous three encounters, though he would make a return to the substitutes' bench at Burnley before earning a starting berth in the FA Cup tie against Brighton.",
      "While Amorim remained in the dugout, Mainoo appeared destined for an exit. He's yet to feature from the start in a league fixture this campaign, though he was seeing increased involvement under Amorim before injury intervened.",
      "Despite speculation linking the England international with a transfer that could potentially revive his World Cup ambitions, most reports suggested any departure would be temporary rather than permanent. Furthermore, Amorim's public statements - even while he continued to overlook the 20-year-old - hinted at a conviction that Mainoo still had a future at Old Trafford in some shape or form.",
      "\"I think he's playing in one position, he's fighting with Bruno. They can play together. We need to improve that position and you can see it against Fulham, so I just expect the best from Kobbie, the same as everyone.\"",
      "These remarks followed United's second fixture of the campaign against Fulham, marking the second consecutive match where Mainoo remained on the bench throughout. The youngster would eventually make his first start of the season in the FA Cup clash with Grimsby, but a sustained run in the league side failed to materialise.",
      "Mainoo playing against Brighton in the FA Cup(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Fernandes' remarkable fitness record meant Mainoo's involvement was largely limited to substitute appearances, though a 30-minute cameo against Bournemouth suggested Amorim might be prepared to deploy him the following week as cover for the suspended Casemiro. Sadly for the player, injury intervened before that fixture, and he remained unavailable whilst Fernandes himself was forced off injured against Aston Villa.",
      "A January loan switch to Napoli, where Mainoo could have reunited with former United colleagues Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund, had looked the most likely outcome. Now, though, Michael Carrick's appointment as interim boss could provide him with a fresh opportunity - particularly given Carrick's previous statements about the importance of United's youth system.",
      "\"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it... I think Man United's got to have an element of that. It always has done and always should have,\" Carrick said in 2025. \"To have a talent like Mainoo, which he's shown already, you've got to have players like that [in the team], players that you can say, 'They get it. They know it. Let's help them and stick with them'. I think there's definitely a place for him there, for sure.\"",

      "His final playing stint was with Derby County, where he became permanent manager after retiring. After leaving the Rams, Rooney spent just over a year managing DC United in America before returning to England. His spell at Birmingham City proved short-lived, being dismissed in early 2024 before taking his most recent position with Plymouth Argyle, which ended later that year.",

      "Rooney revealed: \"He's obviously with Puma but when he plays for the Manchester United U16s, something which I really like is he can't wear his Puma boots.",
      "\"All the academy have to wear the same boots. They do it because there's people from areas where they can't afford certain boots so I think it's really good.",

      "This is how the United players rated:",
      "Senne Lammens: Lost his bearings to needlessly concede a first-half corner but made amends with a save from Max Alleyne. Good hands in the second half. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Booked for a reckless early challenge on Jeremy Doku and then a poor pass straight out of play, but did well to recover his poise after that. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Should probably have scored early in the game but excellent defensively against Erling Haaland. A real front-foot performance. 8",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Superb sliding block on Haaland early in the second half. Read the game well and was good on the ball. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Booked in the early stages as well but coped well with Antoine Semenyo, who had Phil Foden in support in the first half. Intelligent performance. 7",
      "Casemiro: Should have scored, but excellent recovery tackle on Haaland after Kobbie Mainoo gave the ball away. A magnificent holding midfield performance. 9",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lovely shimmy past Semenyo a reminder of his talents. A bit careless with a loose pass to Haaland in the second half but deserves a run in the team. 7",
      "Amad: A real livewire. Tormented Nathan Ake and then got Nico O'Reilly booked inside three minutes. Could have easily had a goal and was a threat throughout. Hit the post late on. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Unlucky with the narrowest of offside calls. A sublime pass to create a chance for Dorgu and perfect pass for the goal. Bruno at his best. 8",
      "Patrick Dorgu: A surprise selection but what an impact. Sharp on the ball, good first-half volley and really alert to get the second goal. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Exceptional work rate and clever movement to try and pull City's defenders out of position. Good volley to test Donnarumma and clinical with his next chance. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Made an impact at both ends of the pitch. Big tackle on the edge of his own area and assist for Dorgu's goal. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Little time to make an impact after coming on for the shattered Casemiro. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Thought he had scored late on but ruled out for offside. 7",
      "Ayden Heaven: A late introduction. 6",

      "Three questions, Michael: how long would you like on your contract, what would you like your salary to be, and where would you like your statue?",
      "Manchester United said they wouldn't get carried away this time, but when Old Trafford rocks as it did on Saturday, it can be hard not to. You can guarantee that Michael Carrick is a shorter price to get the job on a permanent basis now than he was when he woke up on Saturday morning.",
      "He couldn't have dreamt it would go this well. This was United's best performance of the season by a long, long way. It was probably their best performance since beating the same opponents in the 2024 FA Cup final. Carrick addressed a group of players on Wednesday morning who had looked beaten down at the end of another manager and after a dismal run of form in a forgiving run of fixtures.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "To bring about this improvement in three training sessions is an eye-opening achievement. United were clever, sharper and more intense than City. Rarely can they have dominated a derby to this extent in the Pep Guardiola era. When the Catalan went to the away end at full-time, he was greeted by empty seats. City fans had long since seen the writing on the wall.",
      "Guardiola had wrapped his hands around Carrick when the whistle went and whispered a few words in his ear. See you next season, perhaps? There's plenty more work to be done until that happens but this felt like a day when the 44-year-old put himself firmly in contention for the job.",
      "He added Guardiola to Mikel Arteta and Unai Emery in the list of managers he has bested while in the United dugout. There was a draw against Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea as well. That is already quite the CV and whatever happens, he will never forget this day.",
      "It had been more than three years since United had last been able to celebrate a derby goal at Old Trafford. That Marcus Rashford strike earned them a victory in January 2023 during a 20-game unbeaten run at home in Erik ten Hag's first season.",
      "For a while, it looked like the Dutchman had cracked the code, but it proved to be yet another false dawn. They've got used to those around here. Amorim has just overseen another wasted 14 months and how futile those dark days look now.",
      "Amorim forced United into a tactical straitjacket, his desire to match up the Premier League's worst team the final straw for a club desperate to see some enterprise and ambition on the pitch once again. Carrick delivered that. Four at the back. Fernandes freed up. Pace and invention on the wings. No wonder Sir Alex Ferguson was smiling.",
      "United played from the first minute as if they had been reinvigorated by Carrick's return. Harry Maguire headed an early corner against the bar and Gianluigi Donnarumma saved from Patrick Dorgu.",
      "There was an aggression to United's play that hinted at a desire to make an impression to a third head coach already in 2026, but that spilt over into early bookings for both full-backs. Diogo Dalot left a mark of the wrong kind when he caught Jeremy Doku high on the shin and although contact was only glancing, he was fortunate to not be put through the wringer of a VAR check at least.",
      "Luke Shaw clattered into Rodri to pick up his booking, but the spark in United's play was unsettling City. They hunted the ball in packs and looked to spring forward at speed. Mbeumo's movement pulled around the inexperienced Max Alleyne and Abdukodir Khusanov, while the wingers and Fernandes tried to break in behind.",
      "The method led to Amad and Fernandes both rounding Donnarumma to score in the first half, only for the linesman's flag to deny them. The calls were marginal, but correct; they gave United encouragement that they were on the right path.",
      "If they wanted further vindication, they got it from Guardiola's half-time subs, bringing Nico O'Reilly and Rayan Cherki on, but it did little to contain United. O'Reilly was booked for a foul on Amad within three minutes of his arrival, so he was powerless when the winger ran at him 10 minutes later. Donnarumma saved his shot and then stuck up a hand to keep out Casemiro's follow-up from close range.",
      "When the Italian goalkeeper saved again from Mbeumo a few minutes later, you started to fear United would pay for missing so many chances, but then they struck in a manner straight out of the playbook from derby successes under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "City had control with a free-kick midway in United territory, but when play was turned over, the speed and execution of the break was something to behold. Fernandes led the breakaway, and with three players in support, he picked the perfect pass to Mbeumo, who this time gave Donnarumma no chance.",
      "Ten minutes later, the game was done. City had shown little sign of mustering a response and when Dorgu was more alert than Rico Lewis to reach a Matheus Cunha cross, he sent the Stretford End into raptures. Amad hit the post late on after another thrilling break, and Mason Mount managed a third disallowed goal.",
      "After sharing an embrace with Guardiola, Carrick turned around, a beaming smile on his face, and offered a clenched fist towards his family sitting high in the stands. There was a more visceral show of emotion towards the Stretford End as he headed down the tunnel. He has made his mark.",

      "Michael Carrick liked what he saw from his United players before the game(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick had confidence Manchester United were going to deliver a performance on derby day at Old Trafford when he saw the emotional state of his squad as they lined up in the tunnel. United produced their best performance in a long time to beat Pep Guardiola's side 2-0 on a day when they also had three goals ruled out for marginal offside calls.",
      "Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu handed Carrick a win on his return to the dugout at Old Trafford. A performance full of attacking intent was the perfect antidote to recent weeks and Carrick praised his coaching staff of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion for getting the message across, and the players for taking it on board so quickly.",
      "\"The players left the changing room unbelievably desperate to do well,\" said Carrick. \"I was thinking, don't be too desperate where it can cloud your judgment and you make decisions that you make because you're emotionally so invested in it.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I thought they got the balance so right and the supporters were incredible. I said yesterday this can be a magical place, and it does some funny things, and today to get that feeling is exactly what we want. Hopefully, just to start something we need to build on. We're not getting carried away massively, but you've got to enjoy the feeling certainly when you get it.\"",
      "United created an xG of 3.8 against City in what was a one-sided derby and Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount all saw goals ruled out.",
      "It was a remarkable coaching achievement on the back of three sessions at Carrington and Carrick was delighted to see the squad buy into those ideas.",
      "\"I just think the boys have shown me that they're really willing to listen and learn, as I said, [they're] almost desperate,\" he said.",
      "\"They want it so much and the willingness to take the information on and change things a little bit and be willing to adapt. We obviously put a game plan and a strategy together that tried to achieve certain things and everyone played their part in the end.",
      "\"Before the game, I spoke with the coaches, and we said the boys were in a good place. We were quite happy with the days we prepared for it. Emotionally, where the boys were, I was quite happy with that leading into the game, but then City are an unbelievable team with talent and they can rotate and change things, so there's a plan and then you've got to go plan B and C and work around it.",
      "\"So you never really know how the game is going to go, but for it to pan out like that, the boys were fantastic to the heart, I say, in so many ways. And to manage it emotionally with the information we've given them and pulling it together, yeah, it was pretty good.\"",

      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez revealed that Michael Carrick told the squad to use the support of Old Trafford to inspire them to a win over Manchester City in the Premier League. The Reds came into the derby with the pressure on after Ruben Amorim's departure and recent disappointing results.",
      "However, they looked like the team with more confidence and could have been 2-0 up at the break had it not been for tight offside calls against Amad and Bruno Fernandes. United kept up the pressure in the second half and it finally told in the 65th minute.",

Today we defended so well. We were so compact all the time and then you have the confidence to go into the duels.",
      "\"You feel today a different energy in the eyes of the players. Today the team won, that's the most important thing for me.\"",

      "After Amad and Bruno Fernandes had goals ruled out in the first half, United finally beat Gianluigi Donnarumma when a quick counter attack from a City free kick resulted in Bryan Mbeumo slotting home. The Blues weren't at the races and when Rico Lewis switched off at the back post, Patrick Dorgu nipped in to make it two.",
      "United thought they had a third in stoppage time through Mason Mount but Matheus Cunha was just offside in the build-up. The defeat leaves City six points behind Arsenal in the title race with the Gunners holding a game in hand.",

      "Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that unbelievable from the staff and the players. I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.",
      "Speaking after the game, City captain Bernardo said:",
      "A really bad game from us, they were much better than us and deserve to win today. Man Utd are a team that loves to play in transition, we love to play in possession, when we don't control well those moments, we give them exactly what they want. Today was that case. We accelerated way too much the game, it became a transitional game, for the quality of their players it suits them. Even at half-time when 0-0, we had the feeling they were very close to score, we give them what they want.",

      "Three questions, Michael: how long would you like on your contract, what would you like your salary to be, and where would you like your statue? Manchester United said they wouldn't get carried away this time, but when Old Trafford rocks as it did on Saturday, it can be hard not to. You can guarantee that Michael Carrick is a shorter price to get the job on a permanent basis now than he was when he woke up on Saturday morning. He couldn't have dreamt it would go this well.",
      "This was United's best performance of the season by a long, long way. It was probably their best performance since beating the same opponents in the 2024 FA Cup final. Carrick addressed a group of players on Wednesday morning who had looked beaten down at the end of another manager and after a dismal run of form in a forgiving run of fixtures.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "City got cup fever in the last week but their return to Premier League action will have made them sick. All the momentum that had been gained from sticking 10 past Exeter and winning away at Newcastle in midweek was instantly lost in a limp Manchester derby defeat that sees them gift Arsenal an opportunity to pull further ahead in the title race. If Tuesday was one of the best performances of the season, this felt like one of the worst from the outset. City just didn't look themselves, not least young defender Max Alleyne being so skittish passing out from the back when he had oozed calm in the north-east.",

I’m absolutely buzzing for the players, for the fans - the fans have been starved of that over the last few years. I know it’s only one performance but I think everyone could see how exciting that team can be. You hear everyone, especially us as ex-players, talk about the United DNA and that has just shown what it is. Work rate off the ball, wingers getting back filling in and helping out the full-backs.",

Today is the best moment to do it. Not just the players on the pitch, the staff, everyone was part of that.",

      "Michael Carrick will take charge of his third Premier League game as a manager this weekend(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick wasn't your typical English holding midfielder. A classy, controlling passer, for a while he was considered England's answer to Pep Guardiola. Nine years ago, Guardiola himself called Carrick \"one of the best holding midfielders I've ever seen in my life\".",
      "How far do the comparisons go? If Carrick was the English answer to Guardiola in midfield, could he also be the English answer to Guardiola in the dugout? It's not exactly a perfect comparison, admittedly. The current Manchester City manager never had a three-season spell in the Spanish second tier that ended with shrugs of shoulders all round.",
      "But there has often been a sense around Carrick that he has the talent to make a success of a managerial career, never more so than the early months at the Riverside when he supercharged a play-off push after inheriting a team shaping up for a relegation battle. Coming on the back of a three-game spell as a caretaker at Old Trafford that produced wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, and a draw with Chelsea, it hinted at promise.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The momentum has stalled since then, and it looked like Carrick was considering whether he wanted to continue pursuing a career in management, but when the club that shaped his career came calling last week, he couldn't say no.",
      "On Saturday lunchtime, he will walk out of the Old Trafford dugout and take charge of his third Premier League game as a manager. Next to him will be Guardiola, his stylistic equal as a player but a coach who has now amassed more than 1,000 games as a boss, almost all of it at the very elite level",
      "The contrast in experience is stark, and although Carrick, 44, ticked the box as a former United great, his CV and lack of experience weren't necessarily deserving of a 17-game spell in charge at Old Trafford, but he insists he feels ready for the challenge ahead.",
      "\"I've never really thought about it like that,\" he said. \"I just feel comfortable, I feel at home. Not comfortable in the fact that it's nice and everything's great, it's comfortable in the fact that I'm happy in my skin, happy in this role.",
      "\"I know what it takes, I worked closely with Jose [Mourinho] and Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] for some time, so when I took over it felt quite a natural step. I understand the questions and that's how it is, you always question until you've achieved something. All I can say is I feel at home, I feel I'm ready and I'm really looking forward to getting to work.\"",
      "Carrick has taken over a squad visibly lacking in confidence and a team sitting seventh in the Premier League, with just one win in seven from a forgiving schedule. He stressed his arrival would act as a \"fresh start\", but games against City and Arsenal in his first two fixtures are a daunting beginning. Despite that, he believes the culture around the training ground and the attitude of the players has encouraged him this week.",
      "\"I've been back in this role for three days, and there's nothing that I've looked at that's really red-flagged anything,\" he said. \"The players have been really good, willing to listen, willing to learn, wanting to do better, wanting to do better for the club, wanting to put in better performances.",
      "\"The culture is something that happens day to day, it's not something I sit here and talk about and a few words here and there and it makes it sound good, it's how you behave and what you end up doing day to day.",
      "\"That's something we've got to build, but certainly at the moment I feel it's a good place and the training ground has been a really good place and we need to make Old Trafford tomorrow an even better place with the help of the supporters as well and that's the magic of what we're trying to do.\"",

      "Roy Keane has again ruthlessly dismantled the new Manchester United coaching group and branded his old club a 'circus'. Michael Carrick was chosen to replace the sacked Ruben Amorim and his coaching staff includes Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "He said: “I'm more concerned with the appointment and the staff that have come in. But I think I would be like that with most people at this stage of the season.",
      "“Looking at the group of players they have, it is going to be a big ask. You look at Michael Carrick, his remit at Middlesbrough was to get promoted, he didn’t do that, so you could say he failed there.",
      "“But it doesn't mean to say he is a bad manager. That was a difficult job. It is great for him, but I look at the staff he has brought in and we sit here every week and talk about Man United being the best of the best and at this moment in time I don’t see that, even with the appointment and the staff, but that doesn't mean to say they can’t get results.",
      "\"It's a great opportunity for him and his staff, but of course I'm concerned, but I said that about the previous manager.”",
      "Before Keane continued: \"It just seems a bit of a circus act at the moment. But if they start well and get momentum, I still think there's a great chance for the team to get in the Champions League, which has got to be the aim!\"",
      "Moving on to Evans, Keane said: “I like Jonny Evans. He’s rock solid and I have signed him twice. It isn’t an issue with Jonny Evans; it is more an issue with the club and the decision-making of who they are bringing in.",

      "Watch a preview of this weekend's Manchester Derby",
      "“My issue with Jonny is that he has got no coaching (experience). It is not like he has worked in the academy for a few years. You need people on the training pitch.”",

      "“Jonny gets a phone call from United, having left as loans manager, saying, 'Do you want to come back?' I bet Jonny Evans is thinking, 'As the kit manager, or to work with the U12s?' No, to work with the first team!",
      "“A great opportunity for him. You have two games, they don’t go too well. That is probably the end of that, but we have another manager coming in and he wants you to stay on as well.”",
      "Roy Keane has once again ripped into Manchester United over their new coaching set-up(Image: )",

      "“I wouldn’t want to work with people above me who are dictating who your staff are. Telling you what players you are bringing in.",
      "“There has been chaos going on in the background. I am not saying the previous manager hasn’t helped himself, but I guarantee he will come up one day and say there were decisions made he wasn’t happy with.",

      "\"But when you see the replays, the replays aren't good; for me, that's a red card. I know they said don't go looking for things, but it's high, it's across the kneecap, it's a red card all day.\"",

      "Keane then shared his own opinion, insisted: \"Well maybe, but obviously they've had a look at it, do you know what I mean? We always argue about 'does it matter what minute it is? Is it too early? Too early to score a goal?",

      "Michael Carrick is back at Manchester United as interim manager(Image: PA)",
      "As we near the midpoint of the January transfer window, Manchester United have yet to bolster their squad with new signings. However, there has been a shake-up in the managerial department, with Ruben Amorim being dismissed and Michael Carrick stepping in as interim manager for the remainder of the season.",
      "The appointment of former United midfielder Carrick was announced on Tuesday, and he will be immediately thrust into the thick of things. United are set to host Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, aiming to avenge their 3-0 loss at the Etihad Stadium last September.",
      "It's uncertain whether there will be significant transfer activity given the absence of a permanent manager. Last winter window saw Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven move to Old Trafford, but much of the transfer talk around United appears to relate to the summer window.",
      "Despite this, the potential of rival clubs vying for players on United's radar could alter this approach. Two such players form the focus of our Manchester United transfer round-up.",
      "Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes is among the Premier League talents to be linked with United as they look to strengthen their midfield. The club was already aware that Napoli could pose competition for the Brazilian international, but now another contender has emerged.",
      "Gomes, who transferred to Wolves from Flamengo in 2023, seems to be the perfect fit. However, it's reported that Wolves are eager to retain the midfielder - valued at over £40m - as they continue their battle against relegation.",
      "The 24-year-old was gradually integrated into the squad after signing under Julen Lopetegui in January 2023 but has been a regular since the Spanish manager's exit. He has only missed seven Premier League games since the start of the 2023/24 season and his potential suitors aren't deterred by the fact that his team are 14 points away from safety.",
      "United have long admired Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta but they're not the only ones. Sky Sport Italia reports that Juventus have made a bid for the French international, though Palace appear to be holding out for move than the £30m on the table.",
      "Mateta's contract expires at the end of the 2026/27 season and it has been suggested that his contract situation is responsible for the decrease in the valuation. United were linked in 2025 only to seemingly be put off by an asking price approaching £50m.",
      "Crystal Palace star Jean-Philippe Mateta has plenty of admirers(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former Mainz striker Mateta has netted eight goals in 21 Premier League matches this season, following double-digit tallies in the previous two seasons. The 28-year-old also boasts two goals from three senior appearances for France, having made his debut for Les Bleus in October.",
      "Juventus, who look set to miss out to Roma in the hunt for Donyell Malen, are on the hunt for attacking reinforcements after losing Dusan Vlahovic to injury. Serbian striker Vlahovic, whose contract expires in the summer, hasn't seen action since late November due to an adductor injury.",
      "On the other hand, United filled their striker void with the £73m signing of Benjamin Sesko last summer. However, the Slovenian has yet to fully hit his stride this season, and with Joshua Zirkzee seemingly set for a departure this year, Mateta could continue to be on United's radar.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate has plenty of thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach(Image: PA)",
      "Gareth Southgate says he has no issue with directors of football eroding a manager's authority after Manchester United sacked Ruben Amorim.",
      "The former England boss describes the root cause of Amorim's demise as a power struggle with club executives. United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, who is a former England teammate of Southgate's, won out in the end.",
      "While debating the difference between a manager and a head coach Southgate - previously linked with a move to United - revealed that he insisted on changing his title from head coach to manager after being offered the role. He now refers to himself as a 'leader, manager, coach - in that order'.",
      "A lengthy LinkedIn post titled 'Manager v Head Coach', which Southgate describes as his \"thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach\", reads: \"In the last fortnight, three of Europe's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea have parted company with their head coaches. Of the three, Enzo Maresca served the longest period at 18 months.",
      "\"Although each coach left under slightly different circumstances and for more than one reason, power struggles either with club executives (Amorim), club employees (Maresca) or players (Alonso) were ultimately the root cause of the end of each tenure.",
      "\"The erosion of a manager's authority has been a gradual process over many years. It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of football, technical, or sporting directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the head coach. Personally, I have no issue with this evolution.",
      "\"Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation — and a football club is no different. A head coach neither has the time nor, in many cases, the specialist expertise to manage complex player contracts, oversee global scouting networks, or run sophisticated data operations. Equally, it makes little sense to dismantle medical or sports science departments every time there is a change of head coach.",
      "\"However, in a classic example of Parkinson's Law (where time saved by reducing responsibilities is quickly filled by something else), the modern head coach now finds themselves managing larger squads, bigger backroom teams, far greater analytical demands, and ever-increasing media and commercial obligations.\"",
      "Southgate's comments on backroom teams come days after the announcement that his former England assistant manager, Steve Holland, will support Michael Carrick at United until the end of the season. The former Chelsea assistant is part of the coaching team alongside Craig Mawson, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Southgate's post continues: \"Contrary to the belief of some fans that the role has become simpler (\"they just need to coach\"), the opposite is true. Add to this the complexity of managing modern-day players (many of whom are effectively individual brands), alongside the financial stakes for clubs, and the relentless scrutiny of both traditional and social media, and you have a significant melting pot of problems and pressure. This is not helped by the subtle, sometimes unintentional, shift in power and status implied by moving from the title of manager to head coach.",
      "\"People may argue that 'it's just a title', or merely semantics. From personal experience, it's not. So much so that when I was offered the role of head coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.",
      "\"You may have noticed that my current LinkedIn title reads 'leader, manager, coach' - in that order. That is entirely intentional. It reflects the hierarchy of skills I believed were required to run the England team effectively.",
      "\"The leader operates in the public eye, engaging fans, setting the vision, shaping the culture, and championing and protecting the players and staff.",
      "\"The manager is 'managing' stakeholders, departments and people, maximising collaboration and making plans stay on track. Oh, and don't forget the role of persuading 25 financially independent elite performers to put collective purpose ahead of their ego.",
      "\"Finally, the coach works on the pitch, setting the style of play, preparing tactics to exploit opponents, and developing the technical abilities of individual players.",
      "\"My belief is that we should embrace a modernised version of the traditional manager, where we recognise the people they lead, manage and coach. As I once said to my bosses at England: players are not magnets on a tactics board that can simply be moved around. They are human beings. And managing that reality is at the heart of modern football leadership.\"",

      "Carlo Ancelotti has been tentatively linked with the Man United manager's job(Image: Burak Akbulut/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Carlo Ancelotti has previously criticised the Glazers for their management of Manchester United, leading to speculation that the esteemed manager could be a potential candidate to succeed Ruben Amorim in the summer. The Old Trafford hierarchy chose to part ways with Amorim following an outburst that appeared to question his position within the club.",
      "Amorim was the first full-time appointment made by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe as part of their joint ownership of United.",
      "With no immediate successor for Amorim in sight, they have appointed Michael Carrick as interim head coach until the end of the season..",
      "Consequently, the list of possible candidates for the summer is expanding, including international managers such as Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, and Julian Nagelsmann who may be available, reports the Mirror.",
      "There's also Ancelotti, currently managing the Brazil national team, whom former United assistant Rene Meulensteen believes should be considered by the club.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he’s done it, he’s seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like,\" Meulensteen said. \"I don’t think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else. Ancelotti would say this is what I’m doing. I’m managing what I’m here to do.",
      "“Football has changed. You’ve got Directors of Football now or Sporting Directors and Technical Directors who are there to safeguard the big picture of the whole football operation at a club and then you’ve got a Head Coach who should be working with the squad of players.",
      "“As a coach, you need to be very clear on that. That’s why Ruben Amorim ran into trouble. They obviously weren’t aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than the people in the background.”",
      "It remains uncertain whether Ancelotti would consider a switch to Old Trafford, or if the club's decision-makers are even considering the former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss. Nevertheless, when it comes to alignment, questions may arise regarding the Glazers' involvement.",
      "Whilst the partial sale saw Ineos and Ratcliffe acquire a minority share of the club, alongside control of footballing matters, the Glazer family retain majority ownership. This could potentially create tension, particularly given Ancelotti's candid remarks about the family back in 2016.",
      "\"I was fortunate to be able to coach Real Madrid, although then the club decided to change managers,\" Ancelotti said.",
      "\"That is part of the job, we are exposed to that. In the big clubs it is difficult to stay a long time because the expectations of results are so high.",
      "\"Madrid’s history and demands mean that if a coach doesn’t win trophies, a change is made. You have to respect that. It’s true that there are other clubs like Manchester United, where [Sir Alex] Ferguson was there many years, and now [Arsene] Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "\"These cases are different, as their owners are from the US and they are more interested in the financial aspect than in who is coach.”",
      "Whether Ancelotti genuinely features on United's shortlist for a new head coach remains uncertain, but speculation will persist about the club's requirements moving forwards. The notion of 'Man United DNA' has become a recurring talking point in debates over the next managerial appointment.",

      "Michael Carrick takes charge of his first United training session(Image: )",
      "It's rarely quiet at Old Trafford but the first two weeks of 2026 have been explosive even for the standards of Manchester United. Michael Carrick is the club's third head coach of the year already.",
      "Ruben Amorim's dramatic end and Darren Fletcher's caretaker spell have led to the appointment of Carrick until the end of the season and the challenge that now awaits is to steer the club back into European competition.",
      "That won't be easy and the start is a daunting one, but there is now a sense of calm at Carrington once more. This is the story of a remarkable two weeks and how United got to the point where 44-year-old Carrick was summoned from a beach in Barbados to take charge of the first-team.",
      "There was frustration bubbling away at Carrington on the second day of 2026, but no sense of the explosion that was about to go off at the club's training ground.",
      "The failure to beat Wolves a few days earlier had stuck in the craw of key executives, particularly given Amorim had gone back to his favoured back three formation. Wolves boss Rob Edwards revealed post-match he had always expected Amorim to do just that, while the United head coach said he had wanted to match up the visitors.",
      "That negative approach set alarm bells ringing again. Amorim had gone to a back four and a more attacking ethos against Bournemouth and Newcastle, but reverted to type for a game against a team that, at that point, were still to win in the Premier League.",
      "When director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to Amorim about it at a pre-planned meeting on the morning of Friday, January 2, the head coach \"blew up\". He hinted at the unhappiness in his press conference ahead of the game and then cancelled a planned broadcast interview.",
      "The Amorim era came to a dramatic end at Leeds(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Two days later, he used the final question of his post-match press conference to essentially air his grievances with Wilcox in public. If it was a power play, it was never going to succeed.",
      "Amorim pulled into Carrington the next morning well aware he was about to be put out of his misery. His dismissal was about results, but it was also about his behaviour, not just in that showdown with Wilcox, but in the public criticisms he had aired against some players as well.",
      "There is a feeling that Amorim never quite 'got' United. He never understood the club's values or bought into the tradition of the type of football they should play. He certainly didn't sound like a United manager at times.",
      "It has been suggested that the 40-year-old was taken aback by the sheer scale of the task at hand and the noise that reverberates around the club. He called out people paying too much attention to pundits in his final press conference, but he has never had to deal with a struggling super club before and the spotlight will always be harsh.",
      "It's something Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag had to come to terms with as well, so with only 17 games left to salvage something from this season, United couldn't afford to appoint someone who needed time to get their feet under the table. That is why Wilcox looked to the days of United's past.",
      "Jonny Evans oversees United training on Wednesday(Image: )",
      "There was some schadenfreude at a shortlist of Carrick, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the nostalgia was deliberate. All three understand the club and are used to the noise. There will be no adaptation period required.",
      "In what became a straight shootout between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former's knowledge of a group of players who are yet to click together this season impressed Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada. He is also a progressive appointment whose best days as a coach might be ahead of him, whereas it feels like Solskjaer's best days in management are in the rearview mirror.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox also felt Carrick could work in a collaborative structure that Ineos are putting together at Old Trafford. He is a hands-on coach, whereas Solskjaer's experience at United is more managerial, although that is partly due to the absence of a clear structure when he was in charge between December 2018 and November 2021.",
      "Carrick's coaching pedigree helped him win the race and it didn't harm his cause that he had made an impact with some of these players as well. His three-game stint as a caretaker in 2021 is remembered fondly, but he also led much of the training when Solskjaer was in charge, along with Kieran McKenna.",
      "He is still a popular figure with some members of that squad who remain at Old Trafford and his ability to quickly assemble a coaching staff has gone down well. In particular, the appointment of experienced No. 2 Steve Holland is considered a wise move.",
      "For a while under Ineos, it felt like the sight of Holland pulling into Carrington was inevitable, alongside former England boss Sir Gareth Southgate. However, interest in Southgate has waned, and Holland's appointment isn't directly related.",
      "Instead, the search is now underway for a permanent head coach, although there is intrigue surrounding the removal of the word 'interim' or 'caretaker' from Carrick's job title. His job is simply that of head coach, albeit on a contract that runs until the end of the 2025/26 season. Solskjaer was named caretaker manager until the end of the 2018 season, and Rangnick was the interim manager in November 2021.",
      "United stresses that those decisions were made under a different regime, and the decision not to use the words 'interim' or 'caretaker' is due to the length of time he will be in charge. The process to appoint a permanent head coach will be a thorough one, but Carrick will inevitably be in the picture. The results will dictate the strength of his case.",
      "Carrick, Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were in place at Carrington on Wednesday morning to welcome the players. There were \"good vibes\" around the place, as one source put it.",
      "Plenty of the squad already know Carrick and some know Holland as well. Carrick's career means he commands respect from the squad. He held a relatively brief introductory team meeting on Wednesday morning before a first training session on the grass which was watched by Wilcox.",

      "There will be two more sessions before City arrive on Saturday and the Carrick era truly begins.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has slashed the price of Nice for a potential sale of the French club(Image: (Photo by Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has slashed the asking price of French club OGC Nice, in a continued bid to end his stake in the team.",
      "That's according to Bloomberg, which states that Ineos had been seeking over €200m (£173m) to complete a full sale of the club in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Ratcliffe had put Nice up for sale last year, but there are claims that investors were not willing to pay the asking price for the Ligue 1 outfit, so the price has \"come down significantly\" to aid in offloading them.",
      "The main challenge facing the British billionaire, and the advisory firm Lazard Inc, who were hired to help seal a deal, surrounds uncertainty with the TV deal in France.",
      "DAZN had originally taken on the rights, but after a deal collapsed, Ligue 1 have been managing and distributing their own broadcast deal among clubs.",
      "Any deal for an investor to buy the Ineos stake in Nice would end nearly seven years of the company at the head of the French club, which has come with mixed results.",
      "So far, Les Aiglons sit 14th in the league with just a six-point buffer to the relegation places, while they are yet to register a single point in the Europa League, with criticism coming in for the management of the club in recent years.",
      "It comes at a time when Manchester United face their own challenges and turbulence under the part-ownership of Ineos and Ratcliffe.",
      "There have been signs of improvement, following last season's dismal showing in the Premier League when they finished 15th, but chaos has ensued following the decision to sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese coach was the first full-time head coach hired under the new ownership and sporting structure, which has seen Ratcliffe's group attempt to transform the way they operate behind the scenes.",
      "This clearly caused tension for Amorim, who outlined the fact that he wanted to be a manager and not a head coach at the club, despite the new structure featuring a director of football in Jason Wilcox.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said in early January when asked about his optimism with the board.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "His exit, along with the hiring of Michael Carrick as caretaker manager, outlined the need for Ineos to get the next hire right to help push Man United in the right direction again, while there has been some scrutiny over the situation with the departing head coach.",
      "That change in direction will have to coincide with a clear game model implemented from the sporting department, along with the right types of players signed by the recruitment department to play specific roles.",
      "Whether they can create that joined-up thinking in the hierarchy remains to be seen.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney has heaped praise on Michael Carrick for bringing back the “United DNA” to Old Trafford in a 2-0 win over Man City on Saturday.",
      "The Red Devils were brilliant against the Citizens as Carrick claimed a well-earned victory in his first game as Man Utd’s new interim manager.",
      "Carrick was given the job until the end of the season, when Man Utd are expected to announce a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim, and he aced his first test.",
      "Many former players have claimed that Man Utd are yet to play with ‘United DNA’ since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club as manager in 2013.",
      "But Rooney was impressed by Carrick reverting to that type of football in an impressive victory over Man City, in which Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu scored the goals in a result which could have been even more comfortable.",
      "Rooney told BBC Sport: “Obviously I’m absolutely delighted. I think the team spirit, the work rate, the energy, everything about that team was fantastic today. I’m absolutely buzzing for the players, for the fans – the fans have been starved of that over the last few years. I know it’s only one performance but I think everyone could see how exciting that team can be.",
      "READ: Guehi to Liverpool, Neves to Man Utd among six forced hijack transfers to save this January window",
      "“You hear everyone, especially us as ex-players, talk about the United DNA and that has just shown what it is. Work rate off the ball, wingers getting back filling in and helping out the full-backs.",
      "“And the goals; crosses in the box and desire to get on the end of it. The first goal, counter-attack, sitting in and breaking fast – that is the United DNA and that was what we’ve been missing. And hopefully this continues.",
      "“The work rate, the shape, the organisation of Manchester United today, the desire to get back and double up and help your teammates out and tackle and run without the ball, as quickly backwards and you do forwards. I think that was really evident today.”",
      "Goalscorer Mbeumo thought the atmosphere at Old Trafford was “unbelievable” against Man City and claims Man Utd “used the energy of the fans” to win.",
      "When asked if it was the most special day he’s had at Man Utd so far, Mbeumo replied: “I think it’s one of them. Scoring in front of this stand is unbelievable. Derby is even more and like Licha [Martinez] said, we used the energy of the fans today. This place was unbelievable today.”",

      "On there being a lot of change while at AFCON, Mbeumo added: “When I came back a lot of things changed. I think we have a very good group. We always stick together. We have a fantastic unit, so it is unbelievable.",
      "“It is a bit of everything. It is not easy because we only had three days. Because we are all together, we all want to win the same way with the same aim.”",
      "Mbeumo’s team-mate Lisandro Martinez, added: “Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Being here with the fans, with the team we really know how we suffer during the season. But the only way is putting the face here and showing here who we are. Today is the best moment to do it. Not just the players on the pitch, the staff, everyone was part of that.",
      "“I think one important thing that Michael Carrick said was ‘use the energy of the people’ and today I think we did it and when we are together like this it is impossible to lose at home.",
      "“When you play against these kind of players, the team defend. Not just one or two players. Today we defend so good, we were compact all the times. And then you have the confidence to go to the duels. Today you feel a different energy when you see the eyes of the players. Today the team won and that is the most important thing.”",

      "Let’s be honest, the January window has become really boring as most of the transfer excitement is reserved for the summer.",
      "This is partially thanks to Profit and Sustainability rules dissuading clubs from making panic buys, while it is also the case that the best players on the market are available in the summer, not the winter.",
      "We are now past the halfway point of this window, and there has only been one transfer worth more than £50m, which is not good enough if you ask us.",
      "The race to sign Antoine Semenyo was fun while it lasted, while the Conor Gallagher saga has been one of the very few deals to provide some thrill this month.",
      "In Gallagher’s case, this is because Tottenham Hotspur pulled one off one of those incredibly fun transfer hijacks, having been forced into a £34m deal to beat Aston Villa to the signing. More of this goodness is required if this transfer window is to be saved.",
      "So, here are six more players who could follow Gallagher in being at the heart of a forced hijack transfer in the coming weeks, with Liverpool and Manchester United potentially dragged from their slumber to do some business…",
      "",
      "Teenager Diomande falls into the bracket of a player who is far more likely to secure a move in the summer than this month, with Fabrizio Romano confirming that Spurs have already tried and failed to sign the winger in this window.",
      "The teenager has eight goal involvements in 15 Bundesliga games this term, so it is no wonder that he is being earmarked by current club RB Leipzig and several Premier League sides for a big-money transfer in the near future.",
      "Leipzig are rightly opting to hold out until the summer, by which point there will be more competition and likely a higher valuation for Diomande. But plans could always be brought forward if a club makes a silly and irrefusable offer, which Spurs have already proven with Gallagher that they are willing to do.",
      "Diomande will likely have clubs higher up the food chain looking at him in the summer, with Liverpool among the sides who should bring their plans forward if their hands were forced with a sizable Spurs bid.",
      "Were this to happen, Diomande would obviously choose to join Liverpool over Spurs to bolster their winger department, which suddenly looks rather weak following the exit of Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah’s decline.",

      "One certainty in the transfer market this year is that Man Utd will revamp their midfield as part of a long-overdue overhaul.",
      "United’s focus on signing attackers and Bruno Fernandes’ failed transfer meant INEOS had to push back their midfield plans, with £100m-rated Carlos Baleba among those put on the back burner.",
      "All reports indicate Baleba remains an option for Man Utd, along with Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson, but they need more than only one of these Premier League standouts if they are to fix their midfield.",
      "Man Utd’s next marquee signing is likely to be one of those three, but this future deal could be supported by one or two affordable signings to cover the potential losses of Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and/or Fernandes.",
      "Gomes, who is reportedly valued at £43m, is certainly a more realistic target for Man Utd this month than those aforementioned midfielders, but Atletico Madrid are currently working on a deal as Wolves seemingly look to cut their losses before his value drops further following relegation.",
      "The 24-year-old will become much cheaper in the summer, but Atletico’s interest could complicate matters and force Man Utd to show their transfer muscle to win a transfer race, which they continue to do despite their woes on the pitch.",
      "",
      "Guehi’s proposed move to Man City is likely too far along for Liverpool to pull off a hijack at this stage, but this is what we want to happen, not what we think will happen…",
      "Liverpool’s collapsed deal for Guehi in the summer was all their doing as they wasted far too much time before striking a £35m agreement with Crystal Palace, who had no choice but to pull the plug on deadline day over their inability to source a suitable replacement.",
      "By all accounts, Guehi had one foot in Liverpool in the summer and they have remained a frontrunner for his services in recent months, but their failed deal in the summer opened the door for them to miss out completely if another club decided to make a serious move for his services, and this is what is currently playing out…",
      "Injuries to Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol gave Man City the impetus to step up their interest in Guehi and they have been rewarded for their proactiveness.",
      "The arrivals of Guehi and Semenyo provide a significant shot in the arm for Man City’s title challenge, while Liverpool have been punished for standing still, as they will miss out on their top centre-back target unless there is a rather dramatic hijack at the eleventh-hour…",

      "Neves is an even more realistic signing for Man Utd than Gomes this month, with the current Al-Hilal star said to be the only player they could sign as he is in the final months of his contract and valued at £20m.",
      "The former Wolves standout is among the considerable examples of players to head to the Saudi Pro League when he still had plenty to offer at the top level in Europe, and this remains the case as he is still only 28.",
      "Neves’ situation makes him a no-brainer signing for most Premier League clubs, including interested sides Man Utd and Newcastle United, and it feels increasingly likely that he will end up back in England at some point this year.",
      "A free transfer would be most beneficial to Neves personally, but a deal could always be brought forward if a club is the first out of the traps in this window.",

      "It is clear that the Hammers are doomed with or without Paqueta in the relegation fight, but it is a bad look for their owners to admit defeat by selling the Brazilian international, who remains one of their better players despite his attitude issues, before a defining run-in.",
      "Still, the player often wins in this scenario and West Ham will likely swerve the headache of keeping him if their valuation is matched, with this offer most likely to come from a Premier League club.",
      "Paqueta has his heart set on a move to Flamengo, but he may have to make adjustments if he’s to leave West Ham this month and a switch to Aston Villa, after Fabrizio Romano cost them in the summer, could still be an answer.",
      "",
      "We were all very wrong about Brentford this season and this is largely thanks to Thiago filling the void left by Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, scoring 16 goals in 21 games as the second-best striker in the Premier League this term.",
      "Unfortunately for Brentford, Thiago’s goalscoring exploits mean the London side will be expecting to lose their prolific striker this year.",
      "The most tempting offers for his services are likely to come in the summer, but Spurs could spoil Aston Villa’s plans with another hijack if each club goes for Thiago this month.",
      "Spurs have been toothless in attack in most matches this season, while Villa need to strengthen after offloading Donyell Malen to AS Roma. Therefore, a swoop for Thiago is not completely out of the question and Brentford could benefit from their respective desperation when negotiating a price.",
      "Again, the north London side would be the victors of this two-way battle because they are in the Champions League and the fact that players often prefer to live in London rather than Birmingham.",
      "Man Utd are still keeping their options open over a potential midfield signing in January with Ruben Neves still a possibility, according to reports.",
      "As if to confine the Crystal Palace misery to one afternoon, Oliver Glasner revealed Guehi’s transfer to Man City and his own exit at the end of the season.",
      "Man City have ‘taken advantage’ of the doubt surrounding Arne Slot’s future at Liverpool to sign Marc Guehi, according to reports.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has now given Marc Guehi to Man City his ‘here we go’ confirmation for January after Liverpool failed to sign him in the summer.",
      "Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi is said to be ‘favouring’ one transfer outcome as Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal show interest in signing him.",
      "Marc Guehi is set to have his pick of clubs in 2026 so we’ve gone through his options and concluded he should ignore Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal’s advances…"

      "",
      "As first impressions go, Andrews’ was a shocker. In his first game as a head coach, Brentford were 3-0 down at half-time on the opening weekend of the season after Forest ran all over them, prompting much smugness amongst those of us who pinned Andrews’ side as relegation fodder.",
      "There’s a chance we may have been wrong.",
      "",
      "Few could hold defeat in his opening game against Edwards, so poor were the team he took over. Second-half goals from Daniel Munoz and Yeremy Pino took Palace fourth and left Wolves bottom and winless in 12. It took eight more games for Edwards to taste victory when Wolves met the only side as f***ed as they are.",
      "",
      "No new returning manager bounce for Everton – not immediately – with Moyes seeing his side sunk by Ollie Watkins five days after he replaced Sean Dyche. After one win in 12, sat in 16th place, it was a sobering illustration of the task at hand.",
      "But Moyes then turned Everton around, winning four of their next five and avoiding defeat in their next nine.",
      "",
      "“I am not happy we have not won the game but happy overall. In terms of attitude, desire and commitment it was better than I expected,” said Arteta after his first match as a head coach in any capacity, when he could not give away shares of trust in his process.",
      "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised after Dan Gosling’s opener to give Arteta a point against Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth. That sentence makes no sense in big 2026. Thierry Henry was not impressed.",
      "",
      "On humble beginnings this Fulham revolution has been built. The Cottagers had been relegated but managed to improve on their managerial situation, with Scott Parker leaving by mutual consent en route to Bournemouth as Silva took up his first post since leaving Everton about 18 months before.",
      "It was an undoubted coup, just not one made immediately obvious by a draw with Neil Warnock’s Middlesbrough. Harry Wilson scored a delightful goal from outside the area because obviously.",
      "",
      "Farke’s first Leeds side on the opening day of the Championship season in 2023/24 featured only three players who played in the last Premier League game in May.",

      "",
      "After a summer of bleating about how harshly Gary O’Neil had been treated by nasty Bournemouth, the time had come for the Cherries to show their working out. A draw with West Ham was respectable enough without coming close to confounding the critics.",
      "Solanke equalised after Jarrod Bowen’s opener, meaning that West Ham had conceded decisive goals scored by summer transfer targets in the first game of consecutive Premier League seasons. Which feels particularly on brand.",
      "",
      "Nuno replaced Graham Potter on the Saturday before a creditable draw at Everton on the Monday. The new manager made a point of acknoeldging the away support: “It’s our priority to become closer with our fans and bridge the gap, and to deliver so they appreciate the work of the team.”",
      "It’s not going well.",
      "",
      "Taking charge of the Europa League winners, Frank’s first official game in charge was the UEFA Super Cup final against Champions League winners PSG. And it was all going swimmingly when Spurs led 2-0  – Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero on target – with five minutes of normal time remaining.",
      "But, Spurs. Nine minutes later, they had been pegged back before they fluffed a penalty shoot-out.",
      "",
      "A victory, but for once that wasn’t really all that mattered. After months of forewarning that Our League would not simply bend to his will and Guardiola would be found out against the sort of proper competition neither La Liga nor the Bundesliga could provide, this was a thoroughly underwhelming start.",
      "The hosts needed an 87th-minute Paddy McNair own goal after an early Sergio Aguero penalty to prevail against a Sunderland side which would be relegated come what May, with the unceremonious axing of Joe Hart from the starting line-up a major point of early contention.",
      "",
      "Le Bris was appointed in the summer of 2024 and whatever scepticism there may have been of the Frenchman on Wearside soon dissipated when an away win at Cardiff, thanks to goals from Luke O’Nien and Jack Clarke, formed the first of four successive wins to kick off the Championship season.",
      "Le Bris’ team featured only two names – Trai Hume and Eliezer Mayenda – who started the opening day of the following season in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "A high-scoring draw in which Newcastle led but needed two equalisers to salvage a point despite having more than twice as many shots, leaving them bottom of the Premier League in late November, confirmed for many the suspicion that this would be a rehash of his exciting but defensively-flawed Bournemouth reign.",
      "Joelinton scored in a neat indicator of his prosperous future under Howe, who was actually confined to a hotel room with the ‘rona and so happily handed over the reins to a bashful and reluctant Jason Tindall. If Newcastle’s manager would prefer we can instead assess his first game in the dugout: a 2-0 loss to Arsenal the following week.",
      "",
      "Ipswich provided a first taste of English football for Slot, who would have known that while anything but a win against their promoted hosts would have been a disaster, no standard of victory could possibly have dispelled those festering post-Klopp concerns.",
      "As it was, Slot pretty much nailed it with that ruthless but ultimately vindicated half-time sacrifice of Jarell Quansah, after which Diogo Jota and Mo Salah scored to mark a humble start to the brave new era.",

      "“I am so happy… it was a special day today,” said the new Villa boss after taking charge for the first time, when they made United look very much second-best. Villa fans almost universally welcomed Emery’s appointment after a year of Steven Gerrard and the players buzzed off it too, racing into a two-goal lead inside 11 minutes. Even when United pulled one back courtesy of a lucky deflection, Villa still kept their visitors at arm’s length and ran out comfortable winners. Not that anyone could have predicted where Emery might take Villa.",

If he is available and affordable then Your Evertons and The West Hams Of This World could probably do with that level of attacking quality – if indeed it still exists after a season and a half in Saudi.",
      "What Dunn can and should be pulled up on is the feigned surprise that Toney is ‘somehow’ not really part of the England conversation any more.",
      "The 29-year-old does indeed have 18 goals in 24 games for Al-Ahli this season, but eight of those have been penalties and he has not scored or assisted in any of his last four appearances for his club and country as a substitute: the role he absolutely would be still playing for England if he was in the picture.",
      "That feels more pertinent than him making someone look silly with a stoppage-time penalty recently.",
      "But as Dunn writes, Toney’s World Cup hopes are basically ‘non-existent’.",
      "‘They should not be,’ he adds, because ‘Toney’s form and composure surely demands Tuchel take another good look at him,’ since having him in the squad means ‘you are taking a penalty taker of the very, very highest order’.",
      "Two points:",
      "1) Are England really still doing the ‘make space in the squad specifically for a specialist penalty taker’ in 2026? They’re all quite good at them now; Toney did score in the shoot-out against Switzerland at Euro 2024 but so did everyone else.",
      "England last missed a penalty in the final of Euro 2020. They definitely need to use a squad spot on someone who won’t play unless there is a sniff of a spot kick.",
      "2) When Jordan Henderson moved to Al-Ettifaq, one writer condemned the ‘significantly lower standard of play’ and ‘mediocrity of the Pro League,’ adding that ‘life in the Saudi Pro League means Henderson’s days in an England shirt are surely coming to an end.",
      "‘He cannot go to the Euros on the back of an entire season in Saudi,’ Dunn added back then. If only Henderson had mugged off Mailson of Al-Taawoun; he’d have been an obvious squad pick.",
      "",
      "‘Jones almost certainly would not refer to himself as a United legend but someone ill-informed in the club’s corporate department thought he was worthy of the title.’",
      "Are things okay at home, Samuel?",
      "Liam Rosenior can’t even crack the top five with a 5-1 win in his first game in charge of Chelsea, while Michael Carrick will hope to be more Emery, less ...",
      "Tottenham v West Ham this weekend is also Frank v Nuno in El Sackico, sending us on a miserable jaunt down Sackico memory lane. Nuno comes up a lot.",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?",
      "Real Betis are honest about their contradictions as the pioneers behind Forever Green, but that and the enlistment of an Arsenal cult hero is why it works.",
      "Many assistant managers work in the shadows – Newcastle’s being the obvious exception – so this week’s Famous Friday Quiz will stretch you…",
      "Roy Keane having a pop at Michael Carrick’s wife only exposed his ‘bitterness’ and laziness, with fellow failed manager Gary Neville just ‘nodding along’."

      "Man Utd plan to make a huge offer for Atletico Madrid’s Pablo Barrios in order to help revamp their midfield in the summer, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on new signings in the summer transfer window in order to back Ruben Amorim, who was sacked last week after falling out with director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "Man Utd mainly spent the money on improving their attack with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all signing for big fees.",
      "But many supporters were frustrated that Man Utd had failed to get a deal over the line for a new midfielder despite links to Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, who recently completed a move to Tottenham.",
      "It has been revealed recently by widespread reports that the Red Devils are unlikely to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "But Spanish website Fichajes insists that Man Utd’s transfer plans have ‘taken an aggressive turn’ with news that they are ‘preparing a €100m (£87m) bid’ for Atletico Madrid’s Barrios in the summer.",
      "Man Utd ‘are desperately seeking to revamp their midfield in the upcoming summer transfer window’ and the Premier League giants ‘have identified the young Spaniard as the ideal playmaker for their new project’.",
      "The Man Utd hierarchy are convinced that Barrios ‘would bring the clarity and passing ability that the current squad urgently needs to generate attacking football’.",
      "On the potential signing of Barrios, the report adds: ‘The signing of the Spanish Under-21 international reflects a clear intention to rejuvenate the squad with technically gifted players hungry for continental glory. Manchester United doesn’t want to repeat past mistakes and prefers to invest in proven players from top-level leagues rather than unfinished prospects.",
      "‘Pablo Barrios fits this description of a versatile player who can operate both as a holding midfielder and an attacking midfielder, consistently making runs into the opposition’s penalty area.’",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365…\n* Ferdinand insists £121m striker will ‘100% come to Man Utd’ as Wilcox bends to Carrick demand\n* The two players Amorim wanted Man Utd to sign in January revealed as Carrick refuses to make demands\n* Man Utd duo to be ‘exposed’ by Man City in Carrick system as ‘perfect’ Doku foil to miss derby",
      "Speaking in December, transfer insider Dean Jones insisted that Barrios was a player that he’d heard Man Utd “really like”.",
      "Jones said: “It’s hard to know quite how seriously to take him as a genuine target at this stage, but Pablo Barrios is a player that I have heard Man United really like.",
      "“I think the interest may have even come as a consequence of looking at Conor Gallagher. But, regardless of how they ended up watching him, he’s spoken about glowingly at a few clubs and United are one of them.",
      "“Gallagher has obviously been spoken about as a midfield option but Barrios would actually be a very good fit for what United want long term – and Amorim doesn’t just want a loan in midfield or to sign someone for the sake of it. He wants players that fit the longer vision.",
      "“Atleti won’t want to lose him because he has become very important in their midfield but I think there could be some potential for them to have a fight on their hands to keep Barrios across 2026.”",

      "Michael Carrick marked his Manchester United homecoming by restoring a familiar feeling as an attacking display secured his side derby day spoils with a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Having only been installed as head coach until the end of the season this week to replace the departed Ruben Amorim, United looked different and Old Trafford felt different.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal, a fully deserved one, was one taken in vintage Man Utd fashion. Rayan Cherki's ball into the box, turned into a speedy three-pronged counterattack for United and Bruno Fernandes slipped in the goalscorer to net his seventh of the league season.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",
      "There were more shades of the past as Matheus Cunha, a second-half substitute, crossed into the area for Patrick Dorgu to finish.",
      "At that point, United had already had the ball in the back of the net twice with both finishes ruled out for offside. Both Amad Diallo and Fernandes thought they had given United the lead in the first half only to see the assistant referee's flag raised.",
      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",
      "While United impressed, they were fortunate to have ended the game with 11 men after Diogo Dalot escaped what Mike Dean called \"100 per cent\" a sending off after a challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "Pep Guardiola, though, could only watch on as his side were played off the park as title-chasing Man City could only muster one shot on target, relying on five crucial Gianluigi Donnarumma saves to also avoid humiliation.",
      "City are now at risk of falling nine points behind league leaders Arsenal, who play Nottingham Forest later on Saturday. Man Utd, meanwhile, move up to fourth.",
      "\"Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that was unbelievable from the staff and the players.",
      "\"I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",
      "\"The better team won. They had energy we didn't have. Congratulations to them.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end with crosses. We know they are a transitional team, but in general they were better.",
      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",
      "\"We never made a threat, crosses or movement, but that's part of the energy.\"",
      "On Erling Haaland's substitution, Guardiola said the striker was taken off to introduce \"new energy\".",

      "Friday 16 January 2026 18:08, UK",
      "I've had the pleasure of spending a bit of time with Michael Carrick in the last few months at two different charity events, the last being his own foundation's boot collection at Macclesfield FC recently.",
      "As I spoke to him off camera, I was left in awe.",
      "We were in a room with former Rochdale player Luke Matheson, who scored against Manchester United at the age of 16 in the Carabao Cup in 2019.",
      "Carrick, who was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's backroom staff at the time, remembered every moment of the game while talking to Matheson - whether it was details of the match or Rochdale's coaching staff and where they are now.",
      "One observation I have through my limited interactions with Carrick over these last few months is that he absolutely understands the significance of not just Manchester United, but how important football is as a tool to impact the community in various positive ways.",
      "As he repeatedly said in his first interview with the club, 'I am one of them,' he said when referring to the fan base at Old Trafford.",
      "You may ask, why is this important?",
      "Carrick takes over a club that seems to be at an all-time low. Not just in terms of results and missed opportunities this season, but in terms of morale and confidence - whether that is the players or the Old Trafford attendees.",
      "Being at Old Trafford after the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton, it was not about the performance or even about the result - it was more about what the loss meant in the grand context of where Manchester United are at.",
      "Call it a climax of sustained mismanagement or a rude-awakening of years of decline, facts are facts: this United team have reached record-low numbers - whether it is the first time they've been knocked out of both cups in the first round since 1982 or having their lowest games in a season in over 110 years.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford was telling as well.",
      "A crowd who have remained as patient as possible, who have repeatedly been praised for that same trait, are losing faith with the team that is in front of them.",
      "It was telling after 14 months of Ruben Amorim (mostly) defending his players to the media and trying to protect them from the noise, Darren Fletcher had a different message to send after their FA Cup exit.",
      "In his last news conference as interim, Fletcher repeated that the responsibility has to be on the players in the squad to step up and change the fortunes at the club. He even sounded emotional towards the end. A man who has seen the highest of the highs at the club gave the impression he was left more than unimpressed by what he had seen.",
      "And that makes you wonder what Carrick's new backroom staff, which includes the likes of Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, will find as they take training for the first time this week.",
      "Will it be a team still reeling from Amorim's sacking, which happened just a couple of weeks ago?",
      "Amorim made it clear he had to essentially babysit the players at Carrington and they were not capable of carrying on through training sessions without him. I am not sure that was truly the case but it is easy to forget some, if not much of this squad, has now had five different voices coach and lead them since the start of last season.",
      "The team need consistency, time and more importantly - someone who can lead them.",
      "Whether we will see a repeat of the sad period that former caretaker Ralf Rangnick led or a resurgence which Carrick's competition for the role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, led during his interim stint... well, that is what will make United an intriguing story for the rest of the season.",
      "The good news for Carrick and United fans alike is he'll have much needed fire-power back in his squad for when they take on Manchester City this weekend, with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo having returned from AFCON.",
      "As they have shown in recent years, once again this season, this team have seemingly performed better against 'bigger' opposition this season and have notched impressive wins against Liverpool and Newcastle United for example.",
      "And who knows, maybe City will be the right type of opposition at the right time for this team.",
      "They have shown in draws against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month just how much they struggle to break down teams, especially when they sit in a low-to-mid block and that is the last thing you would expect to see from a City team who feel like the entertainers of the league at this present time.",
      "We know United entertained two former players in Carrick and Solskjaer in this process, but it is important to point out the hierarchy - including director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada - would argue they were not looking to capitalise on nostalgia.",
      "Instead they wanted an appointment who understood the club and could immediately hit the ground running, while also working in the current and relatively new leadership structure implemented at the club.",
      "Carrick certainly does have the above. He spent 12 years at the club as a player while also working under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer during his last stint at the club as a coach.",
      "A balanced and determined individual who has grown from his last time at Old Trafford, it will be especially intriguing to see how Carrick develops the playing style he implemented at Middlesbrough. His 4-2-3-1 out of possession would morph into something more similar to a 3-2-5 when his side attacked, but his team perhaps lacked the firepower and flair required to maximise that type of system.",
      "Whether this United are capable of showing the fight and passion to rescue their season remains to be seen, but Carrick's calm and collected approach feels the right type of character required at a time this team could not be lower on confidence and form.",
      "But it almost feels pointless looking too closely at his stint at Middlesbrough. He would himself admit how much he learned from his first permanent managerial position in football and has wisely stayed out of other positions to digest the two and a half years he had at his previous club.",
      "Solskjaer felt like the right person to manage the club when he rejoined at the end of 2019. He gave United the lift they needed after the end of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "Although he was sacked in November 2021 after a turbulent run of performances and results, he had an incredibly moving exit interview that was published by the club where he was practically in tears saying goodbye.",
      "There were undeniable highs from Solskjaer's reign and perhaps if history had been tweaked - the Europa League final springs to mind - maybe we would frame his managerial pedigree in a different way with a European trophy to his name.",
      "But do sequels often work, even if it is a temporary one?",
      "Solskjaer's return would have been a popular one. There is no doubting his connection and relationship to the club and its supporters but there would have been fair questions targeted at the hierarchy.",
      "Since INEOS' investment, they have attempted to modernise the club as much as they have felt is possible.",
      "A revamped and improved training ground; a more data-led approach for recruitment and analysis; a drive to become best in class in several departments.",
      "Going back to an appointment who worked under the previous regime led by Ed Woodward does not quite feel connected to the previous points mentioned.",
      "Unfortunately for the Norwegian, we cannot forget history. We have to remember how Solskjaer's reign ended in a chaotic, sad fashion.",
      "His final five matches at the club included a crushing 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool, an incredibly one-sided 2-0 loss to Manchester City and a 4-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road.",
      "Context is required too. Perhaps what pulls at United fans' heartstrings is that, after finishing second in his second full season in charge, there is an argument the carpet was pulled under him rather than letting him develop his system and style of play.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when United should have reinforced in midfield and a youthful long-term striker, the club re-signed a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo and added Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Ronaldo compromised the counter-attacking style of football Solskjaer had tried to implement, while Sancho never found a home in the team.",
      "So maybe Solskjaer does deserve a reprieve for how his managerial era at the club ended, but perhaps he needs to rebuild his career elsewhere before a return to Old Trafford in the future.",

      "💥 Semenyo's instant impact at Man City🔴 Attack best form of defence for Carrick📈 Fernandes' return to No 10 role🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Antoine Semenyo has only been a Manchester City player for a week following his £64m arrival from Bournemouth but he has wasted no time in showing just how much he has to offer his new side.",
      "After starting on the left flank and scoring with his right foot in his first game against Exeter, he started on the right flank and scored with his left foot in his second against Newcastle.",
      "One goal came from a run in behind, the other from a back-post tap-in. There was even a demonstration of his set-piece threat with his ludicrously ruled-out second goal on Tuesday night.",
      "He has arrived at the Etihad Stadium with a total of 10 goals in 20 Premier League games which puts him behind only Igor Thiago and his new team-mate Erling Haaland this season. The 26-year-old ranks similarly highly for shots and shots on target.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that he will ease the scoring burden on Haaland, who has scored a higher percentage of his side's goals than any other Premier League player this season.",
      "But he has been signed for the variety as well as the volume of his attacking output. His two-footedness has been cited by Pep Guardiola as a major part of his attraction. Semenyo has an almost even split between right and left-footed goals in the Premier League and ranks as one of the most two-footed shooters in Europe.",
      "His versatility is another factor. Semenyo is comfortable on either flank, as he has already shown in City colours, and that's not all. \"He can play as a striker too with his pace,\" said Guardiola.",
      "Semenyo as a No 9 is an intriguing possibility, especially with Guardiola describing Haaland as \"exhausted\" after the Newcastle game. Maybe Omar Marmoush is not his only rotation option. But it is of course on the flanks that Semenyo can bring the most value.",
      "He was mostly used on the left by Bournemouth in the first half of the season but Manchester City already have Jeremy Doku there. Semenyo provides another option but it is worth noting he played more minutes on the right across his time with his former club.",
      "Semenyo's goal against Newcastle, swept home from close range after Bernardo Silva had flicked on Doku's low cross from left to right, was a first glimpse of how the two wingers can combine.",
      "It also typified their different styles as wide players.",
      "While Semenyo is more of a goal threat, shooting roughly twice as frequently as his new team-mate, Doku excels as a provider, creating nearly twice as many chances for team-mates as Semenyo.",
      "The numbers further illustrate how Semenyo gives Guardiola something different and his penchant for the spectacular is another asset. His long-range strike against Spurs in his final Bournemouth appearance was his fourth from outside the box in the Premier League this season. No City player has scored more than two.",
      "He has scored in each of his last three appearances against Manchester United, giving him the chance to become only the fourth player in Premier League history, after Mohamed Salah, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Sergio Aguero, to find the net in four consecutively.",
      "A look back at those previous three goals offers another reminder of the variety of his threat. While one was fired in off the post with ruthless precision following a run in behind, the others were dispatched first-time, with his supposedly weaker foot, having found space to finish in the box, just as he did on Tuesday night.",
      "Michael Carrick faces Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career on Saturday but he knows better than most how disorientating a meeting with one of his teams can be.",
      "Carrick was part of the Manchester United sides outplayed by Guardiola's Barcelona in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals. The first, he later revealed, left psychological scars.",
      "Present-day Manchester City are a different proposition to peak Barcelona. Guardiola has adapted his style in recent years. But they have the same capacity to blow teams away.",
      "Opponents tend to err on the side of caution against them. Manchester United did just that when they ground out a goalless draw in last season's Old Trafford meeting under Ruben Amorim. But attack might be the best form of defence for Carrick as he plots his first game as Amorim's successor.",
      "Manchester United have, after all, displayed attacking improvement amid their inconsistency this season. Only Manchester City and Arsenal have scored more goals, while only City have a higher 'expected' total. They rank top for shots and shots on target.",
      "Carrick's efforts to build on that attacking improvement will be helped on Saturday by the return of two of his most dangerous offensive players in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo following their involvement at AFCON. It was Amad, of course, who inspired the late victory at the Etihad Stadium last season.",
      "In support of an improving Benjamin Sesko, who has scored three goals in his last two games, they should be confident of causing problems for what is likely to be a makeshift City backline.",
      "Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne impressed in helping Guardiola's side keep out Newcastle on Tuesday but they are 21 and 20 respectively and only have 11 Premier League starts between them. Carrick should make it his mission to test them at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United's back three is no more. Amorim's exit may also signal the end of Bruno Fernandes playing in a midfield two. He returned to the No 10 role in Darren Fletcher's two games in charge and will surely continue there under Carrick, who used a 4-2-3-1 formation in 112 of his 124 league games in charge of Middlesbrough.",
      "Fernandes' heat maps show an increase in activity in his own half in the last two seasons, illustrating how his role changed under Amorim. It is to the 31-year-old's credit that, despite being asked to play deeper, crowbarred into a system that did not suit him, he continued to carry the same influence in the final third.",
      "This season, he ranks either top or second among Premier League players in a host of creative metrics. His total of 56 chances created is the highest by any player not just in the Premier League but in any of the major European leagues.",
      "Not bad for a guy playing out of position.",
      "Now what can he do back at No 10?",
      "Join David Jones and Jamie Carragher for Brighton vs Bournemouth on Monday Night Football from 7pm, kick-off 8pm.",
      "The last column looked at the significance of Martin Odegaard's return to form for Arsenal and the qualities that make him unique.",

      "\"Free Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "That's the sentiment that a number of Manchester United fans and even members of Mainoo's own family haven't been shy in making known over the past year. Under Ruben Amorim, it's fair to say the 20-year-old's early career and momentum hit a major bump in the road.",
      "The midfielder - who Gary Neville once said had \"the world at his feet\" after his maiden games - played a key role for England as the Three Lions reached the Euros final in 2024.",
      "Now, still yet to make a Premier League start this season but still harbouring hopes of making a sensational return to the national team fold, Mainoo has Michael Carrick to learn from.",
      "United's new interim head coach patrolled the midfield to great distinction in his playing days. Now, with the middle of the park a lingering concern at Old Trafford, one of his many tasks will be freeing Mainoo.",
      "\"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder,\" Carrick said in the summer on Rio Meets, asked about Mainoo.",
      "\"He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom. I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and create and take the ball. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get.",
      "\"He's got it and he's shown that. It's a breath of fresh air the way he takes the ball and plays forward and commits people, can play, can dribble, can pass. That doesn't leave you and I think it's just waves that can come and go with time. I've seen it so many times.\"",
      "Asked a direct question whether he'd build the current United team around him, Carrick said: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to.",
      "\"United's got to have an element of that. Always has done, always should, always have.",
      "\"To have a talent like that he's shown already, you've got to have players like that, you can say they get it, they know it, let's help them, let's build them and stick with them and I think there's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",
      "The same thoughts were echoed by Carrick, who told Rio Ferdinand that a \"good midfielder can play in different ways\". Mainoo has been the subject of an experiment to test that theory since he broke through.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, the then 18-year-old was handed his first start at the foot of United's midfield at Everton, impressing alongside Scott McTominay. A flash in the pan turned to a crash in the box as his first season as being involved in the first game culminated in a winning goal in the FA Cup final, again, as part of a midfield two - this time partnering Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "For England, Mainoo would go on to fill a similar role as a No 8 alongside Declan Rice at the Euros, starting every game from the last group stage onwards.",
      "Amorim's eventual arrival at Man Utd plunged Mainoo's role into doubt. Initially used as part of a two, sat ahead of Amorim's infamous back three, Mainoo would go on to be deployed as a No 10 and as a false No 9 at times throughout the course of the season.",
      "In this campaign, Amorim made it clear that Mainoo would be challenging for a spot in the team against an immovable Bruno Fernandes. The United captain, up until his injury in December, had started every game this season bar United's Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "However, his injury didn't provide an opportunity for Mainoo as he too picked up a knock that ruled him out until Fernandes' return. The 3-4-2-1 didn't suit Mainoo but in a return to a flatter back four upon his return to the team under Darren Fletcher, he showed some promise.",
      "The 4-2-3-1 was Carrick's most-used formation during his time at Middlesbrough, with the former Man Utd midfielder setting up that way in 90% of his matches in charge at the Riverside.",
      "Mainoo could emerge as one of the key beneficiaries of Carrick's 17 games in charge at his old stomping ground. Maybe then, we might see a change in matchday attire for any members of the Mainoo family concerned about his lack of 'freedom'.",

      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:40, UK",
      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "Between the Lines takes a look at this season's increase in set-piece goals as Premier League clubs try to give themselves an edge; Arsenal are most effective side, Liverpool least, but what are they doing differently? And where does every team rank?",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright and David Fraser",
      "Friday 16 January 2026 09:38, UK",
      "Set-pieces goals are on the rise in the Premier League.",
      "What's behind the growing emphasis on dead-ball situations? And why are some teams excelling and others struggling?",
      "This week's Between the Lines looks at one of this season's defining trends as clubs vie for set-piece supremacy.",
      "The increase in non-penalty set-piece goals can be seen in the numbers. This season, there has been an average of 0.8 per game, up from 0.6 last term and an increase of roughly 50 per cent from the 0.5 per game average in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "The inverse pattern can be seen for open-play goals. This season's average of 1.8 open-play goals per game is down from 2.2 last season and 2.4 in the campaign before that.",
      "It is part of a shift of emphasis towards set-piece efficiency. Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently used the term \"low-hanging fruit\" to describe set-pieces as a route to goal. It is clearly a view shared by a growing number of clubs up and down the division.",
      "Specialist set-piece coaches were unusual as recently as a few years ago. Now, 15 out of 20 Premier League clubs employ set-piece coaches. Brentford even promoted their set-piece coach to the role of head coach when Keith Andrews replaced Frank.",
      "Arsenal have had success with one of the Premier League's most recognisable set-piece coaches in Nicolas Jover. They recently hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, underlining their commitment to maximising set-pieces.",
      "The specialist coaches are responsible for implementing techniques and devising routines which are honed through practice and repetition on the training ground. Teams are now spending more time on set-pieces during games as well as behind closed doors.",
      "According to Opta, the average number of seconds spent preparing for corners has increased steadily over the last 10 seasons in the Premier League, from 26 seconds in 2016/17 to 36 seconds this term, as players take time to communicate routines.",
      "There has been a similar pattern in time spent preparing for free-kicks, while the time spent preparing for throw-ins has increased even more dramatically this season following the resurgence of long throws up and down the division.",
      "Arsenal continue to be leaders in the set-piece field. The Gunners topped the rankings for set-piece goals, excluding penalties, in each of the last two seasons and occupy the same spot this term, their total of 14 putting them one clear of Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds have the next-highest-totals, with 12, while Liverpool are at the opposite end of the scale having only scored three non-penalty set-piece goals, fewer than even the Premier League's bottom side Wolves, who have scored four.",
      "Liverpool's issues are not limited to attacking set-pieces. They are struggling just as badly defensively. Their total of 13 set-piece goals conceded this term is the joint-second highest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth, on 14.",
      "The result is that while Arsenal sit top for net set-piece goals on nine, having only conceded five to the 14 they have scored, putting them just ahead of Spurs, who have improved considerably in the area under Frank, Liverpool sit bottom on -10.",
      "So what do Arsenal and Liverpool do differently?",
      "On corners, there is a significant difference in delivery type.",
      "Inswinging corners are statistically more likely to lead to goals but Liverpool have taken the lowest percentage of inswingers in the Premier League this season at 48 per cent. Arsenal, by contrast, have one of the highest percentages, at 81 per cent.",
      "This season in the Premier League, there have been 77 goals from inswinging corners, according to Opta, compared to only 11 from outswinging corners.",
      "The difference is partly down to a higher volume of inswingers compared to outswingers. But inswingers have a higher success rate too, with 5.3 per cent of inswingers leading to goals this season compared to only 3.6 per cent of outswingers.",
      "Leeds appear an anomaly given they rank joint-third for set-piece goals despite having taken an even higher percentage of outswinging corners than Liverpool, but it is worth noting their last four corner goals have in fact come from inswinging deliveries.",
      "Spurs are another side enjoying success with inswingers. They have an even higher proportion of inswinging deliveries than Arsenal at 83 per cent and rank as the only side with a better corner conversion rate than the Gunners, as per the graphic below.",
      "By using inswingers, teams are able to target the six-yard box, putting opposition goalkeepers under direct pressure and generating close-range chances from flicks and headers.",
      "The trajectory of an inswinger also opens up the possibility of scoring directly from a corner, as done by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes against Burnley in December.",
      "Targeting the six-yard box with inswingers continues to pay off for Arsenal, most recently in their 3-2 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win at Chelsea, when Ben White headed the opener from an inswinging Declan Rice delivery.",
      "The most recent Premier League example came from the other side, when Bukayo Saka's centre was bundled over the line by Gabriel from a few yards out during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa.",
      "There is a big contrast in Liverpool's corner delivery locations.",
      "While Arsenal have sent 58 per cent of their corners into the six-yard box, Liverpool have only hit the six-yard box with 36 per cent of theirs. A much higher proportion land further away from goal, and therefore in less dangerous areas, due to their use of outswingers",
      "It is a factor which helps to explain Arsenal's superior set-piece scoring record. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher has put Liverpool's issues defending set-pieces down to a zonal marking system which leaves too much space to opposition players.",
      "\"What Liverpool like to do on set-pieces is man-to-man mark, and also have three players in a zone. What that means is, there's an overload outside of the box.\"",
      "Fulham ended up capitalising on that overload in spectacular style but the issue has been apparent all season, with the vast majority of the set-piece goals Liverpool have conceded coming from second balls dispatched by opposition players in space.",
      "The extent of the issue can be seen in the fact that only one Premier League side, Crystal Palace, have conceded a higher percentage of goals from set-pieces than Liverpool this term.",
      "Long throws have been adopted by the majority of Premier League teams this season. The average has more than doubled to nearly four per game. But which clubs use them most effectively?",
      "Brentford have launched the most long throws this season, becoming the first side to reach 100 for the campaign during their 3-0 win over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "Their use of long throws is not new. The Bees were early adopters. This season, their throws have led to three goals, the joint-most in the Premier League along with Crystal Palace and Sunderland.",
      "Interestingly, though, it is Leeds, not Brentford, Palace or Sunderland, who rank top for shots and expected goals from long throws, suggesting they are the most dangerous.",
      "Daniel Farke's side have only scored twice from long throws this season but, from a total of 75 long throws, they have managed 28 shots worth 3.46 xG, compared to Brentford's 27 shots worth 2.73 xG from 100 long throws.",
      "It is just another area in which Premier League teams are scrambling to find an edge as the trend towards set-pieces continues.",
      "Before Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach, we looked at which managers best fit the fabled Man Utd 'DNA' using a stylistic profile of Sir Alex Ferguson's 2012/13 title-winners. Carrick ranked pretty highly but which former Chelsea boss came out top?",
