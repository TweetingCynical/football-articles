      "Fresh developments have surfaced regarding Joshua Zirkzee's prospects at Manchester United as talk intensifies with the January transfer window looming. United brought Zirkzee over from Bologna during the summer of 2024 in a transaction valued at €42.5million (£37.5m).",
      "The Netherlands international arrived at Old Trafford following his acquisition by previous boss Erik ten Hag, though Zirkzee has struggled to secure regular minutes since Ruben Amorim took charge 12 months ago.",
      "Zirkzee has featured in merely five matches for United this season, with four coming in the Premier League, and remains without a goal in the current campaign.",
      "Consequently, persistent rumours have emerged connecting Zirkzee with a potential departure from United when the January market opens.",
      "Nevertheless, The Sun has suggested this scenario is unlikely as Zirkzee appears destined to stay put at Old Trafford. Reports indicate the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of departing United in the New Year.",
      "The publication suggests that the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which is anticipated to result in Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo being unavailable for multiple weeks, is shaping United's January planning.",
      "Zirkzee has reportedly been informed that a January transfer is off the table, with the striker expected to see more action on the pitch in December and January.",
      "Rumours have been swirling for a while now that Zirkzee was eyeing a January exit from United in pursuit of more consistent first-team football, but if recent reports are to be believed, this may not be feasible.",
      "In total, Zirkzee has scored just seven goals for United across his 54 appearances for the club since the start of last season.",
      "United will return to Premier League action after the November international break with a clash against Everton on the Monday after the rest of the league fixtures.",
      "It remains to be seen if Amorim will decide to give Zirkzee any minutes when the top flight resumes this month, with summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo, as well as Amad, often getting the majority of the minutes in the forward line.",

      "Antoine Semenyo is reportedly 'frustrated' by suggestions that he's eager to quit Bournemouth. The forward has been in superb form this campaign, netting six times in the Premier League for the Cherries.",
      "With only Erling Haaland and Igor Thiago managing more goals than Semenyo this term, speculation has mounted over his future on the south coast. A host of top-flight giants are believed to be monitoring his situation, with Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool all reportedly interested in snapping up his signature.",
      "This has led supporters nationwide to wonder whether Semenyo will still be plying his trade at Bournemouth come the 2026/27 season.",
      "When pressed by Jamie Redknapp about his future recently, the Ghana international responded: \"I don't think about it too much. I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens. When they [his former team-mates] all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club.",
      "\"But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year. How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well.",
      "\"I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment.\"",
      "Following his impressive tally of 13 goals in all competitions last campaign, Semenyo became the subject of transfer speculation linking him with a blockbuster switch to Manchester United during the summer window. Yet no agreement materialised, with the Red Devils instead securing the signature of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "At the same time, Tottenham - who had also been reportedly tracking Semenyo - moved to acquire Mohammed Kudus from West Ham in a £55million deal.",
      "Despite missing out on Semenyo, United splashed the cash at Old Trafford over the summer, as Ruben Amorim welcomed arrivals including Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens along with Mbeumo.",
      "The investment from the hierarchy appears to be bearing fruit.",
      "Amorim will be hoping that the international break has given his players the chance to further improve, as they prepare to take on Everton on Monday, November 24 when Premier League action resumes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Premier League big-hitters Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal could have a battle on their hands in the summer. The trio are all monitoring Nathaniel Brown, it has been claimed, with a tug-of-war potentially on the horizon.",
      "Brown, 22, has established himself on the left of Eintracht Frankfurt's defence and received international recognition as a result. The youngster was part of the Germany Under-21 side which lost to England in the Euros final over the summer and earned his first senior cap against Luxembourg in October.",
      "According to Bild (via Sport Witness), Frankfurt are confident of making a significant profit on a player who cost them less than £3million when he signed from Nurnberg in 2024. A sum of €63.5m (more than £55m) has been floated, with Frankfurt's Markus Krosche arguing the left-back is worth a similar amount to what Chelsea paid for Spain defender Marc Cucurella.",
      "“Yes! Because he has three exceptional abilities that you can’t learn. He’s smart and tactically astute, has fantastic technique, and is very fast. And all of that is necessary to have a great career ahead of him,\" Krosche is quoted as saying while discussing Brown and fellow youngster Can Uzun.",
      "“Now is the wrong time to think about who might leave us and when,\" he added. \"They’re both young and should stay with us a while longer. Can has developed tremendously compared to last year. It’s a shame he’s injured now.",
      "“And Nene (Brown) is simply exceptional. He’s made outstanding progress, especially when it comes to defending at a high level. Just look at how he plays against top opponents in the Champions League.”",
      "Frankfurt have brought in good money for some of their star players in recent seasons. Omar Marmoush fetched £59m when he left for Manchester City in January, while the summer sale of Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool could net them up to £79m including add-ons.",
      "Other big-money recent sales include a pair of sales to Paris Saint-Germain, with Willian Pacho and Randal Kolo Muani fetching more than £120m between them. After their latest summer rebuild, Dino Toppmoller's side currently sit seventh in the Bundesliga, while they have four points from four Champions League games despite suffering a heavy home defeat against Liverpool with Ekitike on target.",
      "Jonathan Burkardt is the latest addition to thrive at Deutsche Bank Park. The German international striker, signed for roughly £18.5m from Mainz over the summer, has nine goals in 15 appearances in all competitions this term. It could be Brown, however, who becomes the latest to fetch a significant fee. The defender, who can also fill in on the left of midfield, is under contract until 2030 and Frankfurt will be under no pressure to sell on the cheap.",

      "Manchester United are in the market for TWO big midfield signings next summer - and Elliot Anderson is top of the list. United boss Ruben Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No1 priority to rebuild his squad with Brighton's Carlos Baleba the other big deal in the frame.",
      "Brighton resisted United’s late interest in the 21-year-old in the summer but they remain keen with the Cameroon international also wanting to move to Old Trafford.",
      "But United also see Nottingham Forest's England international Anderson as another target and his ability to play No6 and also as a marauding midfielder means they are ready to pull out all the stops to get him.",
      "Anderson, 23, is attracting huge interest after his impressive performances for club and country and Forest know they are facing a battle to keep hold of him.",
      "However, he is likely to cost less than £100m-rated Baleba and that is why he is seen as a good piece of potential business. United veteran Casemiro’s contract is running down and would have to take a pay cut to stay.",

      "Their summer of big spending was followed by a woeful start to the current campaign, with Amorim's side sitting 14th at the end of September. They have since rallied since then, having gone on a run of five games unbeaten.",

      "The 29-year-old has gone on to amass 81 appearances for the Eagles, scoring on eight occasions. He has also helped the club claim the FA Cup and Community Shield.",
      "Munoz remains under contract until 2028 but it appears that he is already thinking about the next stage of his career. Speaking to Spanish outlet AS, he has admitted that he has ambitions of playing for Europe’s biggest clubs, including United.",
      "“First of all, I think there’s a lot of talk about one club or another,” he said. “If you ask me, it would be a dream to play for one of these clubs, whether it’s Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.",
      "“I think I’m working towards that. I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because for me, it’s a dream to get there.\"",
      "And while Munoz has not been afraid to hide his ambitions, he admits that a transfer will have to wait - albeit the January window remains a potential option. He added: “If you ask me, I don’t have concrete information any of these clubs are interested in me.",
      "“My focus is on Crystal Palace. We’ll see when the winter transfer window gets closer.”",

      "Despite his efforts, Japan managed to claw back a draw with a last-minute goal in Doncaster. This marked Lacey's first goal for England U20s, following his initial call-up to the squad Ben Futcher coaches last month.",
      "Thomas Tuchel also gave the 18-year-old a chance to train with England's senior team at St. George's Park during the October international break. His performances have not gone unnoticed, with under-21s boss Lee Carsley singing his praises after having Lacey train with his team this week.",
      "Carsley said to the Daily Mail: \"He's been in the pathway a good amount of time now, and he's a player that we rate highly. It worked out well that we needed that position for the training we were doing, and Shea was more than happy to come over and train with the Under-21s.\"",
      "\"You can see he's a good talent. I know he's struggled with injuries in the past, which has probably held back his development, but I think it's so important we don't rush these young players; we let them develop in their own time. I think he trained two sessions with us, and I enjoyed having him.\"",
      "Under-20s coach Futcher spoke about Lacey training with Tuchel's team last month. \"It's a good experience for them,\" he said. \"It is where they want to get to, so they can feel how difficult it is and how good those seniors are. It is good for them to see it, feel it and be part of it.\"",
      "Futcher explained: \"We have looked after Shea and helped him get some minutes. He is a top talent, has reconnected with the group, and I thought he performed really well. I am sure Manchester United have a good plan for him. Hopefully, he can stay injury-free and fulfil that potential.\"",
      "\"Because of time lost with Shea, he still has lots to come tactically, physically and mentally. Everybody can see - you have to be blind not to see - the talent he's got.",
      "\"He's got lots to do in his game, and he knows. We're still managing him physically because if he can stay on the pitch and can train every day, I think everyone thinks he could be a top, top player.\"",
      "The Red Devils view Lacey as a genuine first-team prospect. They carefully monitored his playing time last season to prevent any recurring minor fitness issues.",
      "He has attracted significant attention in recent years, with academy observers buzzing about what he could achieve. Some have drawn parallels between Lacey and Phil Foden, and like the Manchester City midfielder, Lacey's future may lie in an attacking midfield role.",

      "Ronaldo was given his marching orders for an alleged elbow on Ireland defender Dara O’Shea. He was initially awarded a yellow card, only for VAR to intervene before the referee upgraded the punishment.",
      "Ronaldo has now been handed a one-match automatic ban for the red card, which will see him miss Portugal’s clash with Armenia on Sunday. And according to reports in Portugal, he has now been released from international duty.",
      "The 40-year-old will now return to Saudi Arabia ahead of making his return to action with club side Al-Nassr, who take on Al-Khaleej next weekend. Speaking after Ronaldo’s red card, Portugal boss Roberto Martinez said: \"The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games - I think that just deserves credit - and today, I thought it was a bit harsh because he cares about the team.",
      "\"He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed and obviously when he tries to get away from the defender.",
      "\"I think the action looks worse than what it actually is, I don't think it's an elbow, I think it's a full body, but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow. But we accept it.",
      "\"The only thing that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth is at the press conference yesterday, your coach was talking about the aspect of the referees being influenced, and then a big centre-half falls on the floor so dramatically at the turn of Cristiano's body.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Ireland boss Heimir Hallgrímsson said: \"He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee. It was his action on the pitch that cost him the red card. It had nothing to do with me - unless I got into his head.\"",
      "Asked if he spoke to Ronaldo after the game, Hallgrimsson added: \"No, I think we spoke enough when he came off.",
      "\"There was nothing to speak about. This was just a moment of a little silliness from him, I would say.\"",
      "Ronaldo’s dismissal could see him miss the start of Portugal's World Cup campaign. If the nation qualifies automatically - and Ronaldo sees his ban extended to three games - he could potentially be sidelined for their opening two group games at the tournament.",

      "Beckham enjoyed one of the most legendary careers in English football, winning a host of honours with United, including the Treble in 1999. Spells at Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain followed before he finally called time on his playing career in his late 30s.",

This is without doubt my proudest moment.”",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo once revealed what he makes of Ruben Amorim giving him the nickname “the poet”. The Portuguese manager has now been in charge of Manchester United for exactly a year, having left Sporting CP midway through last season to succeed Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.",
      "The past 12 months have been more gruelling than Amorim could have ever imagined, having failed to mount any consistent form and constantly fielded questions over the effectiveness of his tactics, as well as facing endless rumours surrounding his potential sacking.",
      "But one person who has quietly had his corner in that time is none other than Portuguese and United football legend Ronaldo. In another bombshell interview with Piers Morgan recently, the 40-year-old Al-Nassr star said he felt his compatriot was doing a good job and could not work “miracles”.",
      "In a damning assessment of how far the club had fallen, he argued that while some of United’s players were good, others didn’t have the “mind” required to be a player at such a club. Of course, it wasn’t the first time Ronaldo had praised Amorim publicly while taking swipes at his former club, who he left in bitter circumstances in 2022.",
      "The pair are former team-mates for the Portugal national team. And during their time playing alongside each other, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner glowingly referred to Amorim as “the poet”, owing to his eloquent and striking communication skills when addressing his compatriots.",
      "In an interview with United, the charming Amorim himself previously addressed the moniker. When asked about it, he said with a smile: “Yeah. But it’s like a funny thing because I like to speak - not too much - but when I speak, I think I speak from the heart. I think people feel that. It was something just to have fun.”",
      "Despite all the doom and gloom, we have certainly observed that quality in his press conferences and post-match interviews. Amorim’s comments are often brutally honest, even to his detriment at times, while still showing plenty of charisma - something which may have earned him more time when results were not going his way.",
      "His achievements across a four-year stint with Sporting, where he claimed two Primeira Liga titles and two Taca da Ligas, made an impression across Europe as clubs raced for his signature. United, desperate to bring in the promising tactician, paid extra to activate his release clause last season.",
      "But English football proved far more difficult than he had imagined. In his first season, Amorim guided United to their worst-ever finish in the Premier League, down in 15th place. He reached the Europa League final last term, where his side failed to qualify for the Champions League after suffering defeat to an equally dismal Tottenham.",
      "After splurging on new signings in the summer and a respectable showing in this season’s opener against Arsenal, United once again returned to their old ways with inconsistency in the league and shockingly being knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town, which brought Amorim closer than ever to being dismissed.",
      "His win percentage at United, at just under 40%, is one of the lowest of any permanent United manager since World War II. However, he finally managed back-to-back wins for the first time earlier this season and his side have managed to climb up to seventh in the league, potentially indicating a change in fortunes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo could play a crucial part in Manchester United's pursuit of Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. The 21-year-old was strongly linked with a switch to Old Trafford in the summer, but the Seagulls' reported £100million asking price proved too steep for the Red Devils.",
      "Ruben Amorim was searching for reinforcements in his engine room but failed to land any midfield targets in the summer, with the bulk of United's transfer budget spent on strengthening their attacking options, including a move for Mbeumo.",
      "A deal for Baleba never came close to materialising, as Brighton chairman Tony Bloom openly confirmed. He said: \"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.\"",
      "Nevertheless, United could still hold an ace card in their pursuit of Baleba, according to The Sun. They report that Mbeumo and Baleba, who are both presently away on international duty with Cameroon, have grown closer during their time together with their national side.",
      "The extended period spent in each other's company has reportedly given Mbeumo a chance to lay the groundwork for Baleba to become a United player in the future.",
      "They also suggest the 26-year-old winger has adopted a 'big brother' role in his relationship with Baleba and has briefed the youngster on what it's like to play for a club of United's stature.",
      "If the rumours are to be believed, Mbeumo will be trying to weave his magic once again during the ongoing international break. It's unclear whether Mbeumo will influence Baleba's decision to stay put in Brighton or team up with his countryman at club level.",
      "The Cameroonian pair are likely comforting each other following their unsuccessful bid to qualify for the World Cup. The African nation took on DR Congo on Thursday night, needing a victory to keep their hopes alive of participating in next summer's tournament.",
      "Mbeumo was on the pitch for the full match and saw former Newcastle defender Chancel Mbemba score past Andre Onana in the 91st minute to secure a 1-0 win.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 50% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "DR Congo, which included former United star Aaron Wan Bissaka, will now face Nigeria in the final, with the victors securing their spot in this summer's World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, a dejected Mbeumo was captured trudging down the tunnel alone, looking frustrated amid DR Congo's jubilant celebrations. Mbeumo had been on a scoring spree heading into the match, netting four goals in his last four games for United, who return to action against Everton on Monday, November 24.",

      "Mason Greenwood is reportedly 'obsessed' with representing England again, despite Steve McLaren holding out hope he will switch allegiance to Jamaica. The former Manchester United forward is currently thriving in Ligue 1 with Marseille.",
      "Having made the switch from the Red Devils last summer, the 24-year-old has 31 goals and 10 assists from 51 outings. This season alone, he has also found the back of the net eight times from 11 outings, while setting up a further three.",
      "And given how he has found his footing on French soil as of late, it is suggested that the Bradford-born striker is infatuated with the idea of playing for the Three Lions again - with his only cap for the nation coming in the form of a slender win over Iceland in 2020. As per the Daily Mail, Greenwood is 'obsessed' with the idea of returning to international football with England.",
      "That's despite McLaren claiming that he was set to join Jamaica for a recent training camp, as the nation looks to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in North America. Speaking about Greenwood, the 64-year-old said in September: \"We acquired a passport and we expected him to be coming to this camp.",
      "\"But in a conversation with his family, he's not going to commit at this time to anybody. He's taking his time over that, so it's a little bit disappointing.",
      "\"We probably have to be more patient, but we will keep the contact, we will keep pursuing him because I know from my conversations with Mason and his family that he loves Jamaica, respects Jamaica.",
      "\"He wants to concentrate on club football and not commit to an international team at the present moment. We have to respect that however much we've worked hard to get him here for these camps. So, who knows in the future.\"",
      "It was thought earlier this year that Greenwood was set to switch nationality to play for Jamaica, with speculation now brewing that he is instead holding out hope to represent England once more. However, Thomas Tuchel confirmed in September that the player isn't in his thoughts.",
      "At the time, the head coach said: \"I have not spoken to him until now. I have not spoken to him or his camp. My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn't give it another thought. He was not in the mix at the moment and he is not in our thoughts for our team.\"",
      "It comes after Greenwood was frozen out of the Manchester United squad in 2022 as he faced allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour. However, the charges were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service the following year.",
      "In the years since, Greenwood has attempted to rebuild his career on foreign soil, impressing with a loan spell with Getafe in 2023, before securing a permanent £26.6million move from United to Marseille last summer.",
      "While England have qualified for the 2026 World Cup in North America, and Jamaica are closing in on stamping their own ticket under McLaren, Greenwood has instead been enjoying the break without international football. Marseille next face Nice come Friday, November 21.",

      "The return of the Africa Cup of Nations means Premier League teams are once again at risk of losing certain star talents for up to one month. The biennial competition will kick off on December 21 and runs through to January 18, which is traditionally a busy period in the English calendar.",
      "And while some teams will weather the storm with relatively few losses, others are at risk of losing a raft of talent. Premier League leaders Arsenal, for example, don't have a single African star in the current first-team squad, while Sunderland could see as many as nine players leave for the tournament.",
      "It's the kind of difference that could make or break a season and some clubs can't afford the sacrifice around this time of year. Just three teams aren't at risk of missing any players, with Chelsea and Leeds being the other outfits without any African stars at present.",
      "A total of 24 teams will compete at the 2025 AFCON, with hosts Morocco the favourites to lift the title. Manchester United, Bournemouth, Sunderland and Crystal Palace each have one Moroccan within their respective squads and a deep run could see that quartet miss a key chunk of the winter schedule.",
      "The Red Devils could end up being the English heavyweight worst affected by the AFCON's arrival. While most major teams will have a maximum of just one or two players absent for a period, Ruben Amorim could have to make do with up to four players missing.",
      "Luckily for him, it will have little effect if Cameroon keeper Andre Onana is called up given he's on loan at Trabzonspor. However, it's a different matter altogether if in-form Bryan Mbeumo goes far with Cameroon, while Amad Diallo (Ivory Coast) and Noussair Mazraoui (Morocco) are also in contention.",
      "Liverpool's sole contender for the competition is a big one too, as Mohamed Salah prepares to travel with Egypt. The four-time Premier League Golden Boot-winner has been off the boil so far this term, though his absence won't aid Arne Slot's hopes for a successful title defence.",

      "Erik ten Hag reportedly clashed with a whopping seven Manchester United players before his managerial reign came to an end in 2024. Cristiano Ronaldo was among them and has been vocal about his fractured relationship with the former United boss.",
      "The 55-year-old tactician enjoyed four and a half years in charge of Ajax, and after his recent stint at Bayer Leverkusen concluded, speculation is mounting over a potential return to Amsterdam following John Heitinga's dismissal. It's been just over 12 months since Ten Hag and United went their separate ways, with Ruben Amorim stepping into the hot seat.",
      "The most notorious bust-up was undoubtedly with Ronaldo. The Real Madrid icon's Old Trafford homecoming generated massive excitement in 2021, and despite scoring 27 goals across 54 appearances, his deal was terminated by United after the bombshell Piers Morgan sit-down, where Ronaldo criticised both the club and Ten Hag.",
      "The Dutch manager would subsequently reveal that Ronaldo \"had to go\", with the Portuguese superstar jetting off to Saudi Arabia to join Al-Nassr, where he remains today. The row flared up again in September 2024, when Ronaldo appeared on Rio Ferdinand's podcast and declared: \"Manchester, they need to rebuild everything, in my opinion. The coach, they say they cannot compete to win the league and Champions League.",
      "\"Manchester United coach, you cannot say that you're not going to fight to win the league or Champions League. You have to be, to mentally say, 'Listen, maybe we don't have that potential, but I cannot say that. We're going to try.' You have to try.\"",
      "Despite remaining at United, Maguire nearly departed the club under Ten Hag, but his transfer to West Ham United fell through in 2023. He held the captain's armband when the former Ajax manager arrived at the club, but subsequently lost the captaincy and was put up for sale, resulting in the proposed switch to the London Stadium.",
      "Maguire himself spoke about the doubt surrounding Ten Hag's management, implying it directly affected their performances on the pitch. \"It was tough,\" he said. \"It probably did damage our performances and results throughout the season.\"",
      "During a training session in Australia over three years ago, footage emerged of Ten Hag lambasting youngster Zidane Iqbal for failing to keep the ball on the ground: \"Keep the ball on the floor... Zidane! Hey! Keep the ball! F***ing rubbish!\"",
      "While some experts might contend this isn't an unusual occurrence in top-flight football, Iqbal wasn't afforded a single chance during the subsequent 2022/2023 campaign despite demonstrating potential. He would eventually join Utrecht for £850k, where he remains today.",
      "There was a time when Jadon Sancho appeared destined for greatness. The winger was setting the Bundesliga alight with Borussia Dortmund and eventually secured his dream transfer to United.",
      "Nevertheless, things haven't panned out for the 25-year-old, who has since had loan spells at Chelsea and Aston Villa. Similar to Ronaldo, Sancho has also engaged in public disagreements with Ten Hag, who axed the attacking player from a fixture against Arsenal, claiming \"poor training performance\".",
      "Sancho responded via social media, asserting he was being used as a \"scapegoat\" and flatly refuting suggestions of substandard training displays, allegedly enraging the United manager. He was consequently loaned back to his previous club, Dortmund, for the campaign, and things remain unresolved for him at United.",
      "Much like Sancho, Martial was previously hailed as one of football's brightest prospects. However, at 29, he hasn't lived up to expectations.",
      "Currently plying his trade for Monterrey in Mexico's top division, Martial's downturn can be traced to his exclusion from the United setup. Throughout the 2023/2024 season, he was banished from senior training sessions, despite battling illness, as part of Ten Hag's squad overhaul approach.",
      "Martial was sidelined for four matches due to illness before the former United manager decided he wasn't match-fit and made him train in isolation. His deal was allowed to expire last year, and he eventually joined AEK Athens for the upcoming campaign.",
      "Despite being amongst the standout stars during Ten Hag's debut campaign, Rashford also felt the unforgiving nature of Ten Hag's management. On New Year's Eve in 2022, United were facing Wolves on the road. Rashford turned up 45 seconds behind schedule for the team briefing and was promptly axed from the starting XI.",
      "Nevertheless, he managed to net the winning goal in the 76th minute after coming on as a substitute. Rashford discussed this incident with Gary Neville on The Overlap. \"I wasn't even that late - he wasn't being harsh - late is late, but it was probably about 45 seconds, a minute late,\" he said. \"I already knew what was going to happen because of the rules he implemented in pre-season. Rules are rules and we've got a game to win.\"",
      "David de Gea, amongst the finest shot-stoppers in United's history, found his spot in jeopardy once Ten Hag arrived, with the Dutchman instantly seeking a replacement goalkeeper upon his appointment.",
      "Contract talks failed to progress as hoped in 2023, and De Gea eventually departed United following 12 years at Old Trafford. He now turns out for Fiorentina in Serie A.",
      "Ten Hag subsequently signed his former Ajax player, Andre Onana, as De Gea's successor, but the move hasn't quite panned out as expected, with Onana currently on loan at Trabzonspor.",
      "Supporters speculated that De Gea was rejoicing over Ten Hag's exit from United last year when he shared a cryptic post on social media featuring the pinched finger emoji.",

      "The Slovenian football great enjoyed stints with Dalian Professional, IFK Goteborg and Trabzonspor, before hanging up his boots in 2023. While he immediately got his managerial career underway as the assistant coach of the Slovenia national team, he also opted for a non-football career upon the end of his playing days.",
      "The 38-year-old runs a small farm in his home alongside his wife, Martina, and their three children with the family residing in Badin, near to Hamsik's hometown of Banska Bystrica. While the mansion features a swimming pool, a playground and pool, the construction of a chicken coop was completed in April 2023.",
      "Speaking to Sport24.sk, the ex-footballer's wife discussed their new career path as she said: \"It's a relatively new hobby for us. It all started in April 2023 during Easter when we ordered eggs to incubate, which later hatched into chicks. During that time, we managed to build a chicken coop.\"",
      "Hamsik revealed that the family had added considerable features to the coop as he explained: \"The coop is custom-made with everything that entails. It's more like a hotel for chickens, with heating and ventilation incorporated, but also with automatic doors that open in the morning so we don't have to get up to check on them.",
      "\"We try to make the chickens happy and ourselves too. So far we have 29 and they lay about two dozen eggs a day. We have plenty, and I'm already thinking of opening a shop,\" the Naples great joked.",
      "It's not just chickens that are under the responsibility of the family as they're also taking care of ferrets, turtles, guinea pigs, dogs and cats in their home zoo. Talking about their love of animals, Hamsik added: \"In general, Martina is a great animal lover and she passed that on to the whole family. If we could, we'd have an animal shelter or a small zoo at home, although we already have one.\"",
      "Hamsik enjoyed a stellar career and part of the deep reverence he possesses in Naples is thanks to the loyalty he showed the club and its fans when courted by big clubs during the peak of his powers.",
      "The Red Devils were routinely linked with Hamsik, who in 2018 admitted he could consider making the move to Old Trafford. In an interview with Kicker, when he was just two goals away from equalling Diego Maradona's then-club record 115 goals, he said: \"It would definitely be the hardest decision in my career.",
      "\"Maybe everyone wants to play at these clubs, but I can't answer that. I think that Napoli are one of the top 10 European teams in terms of game play and performance.",
      "\"As a footballer, it's hard because you never know what comes next. I've still got a long time to go on my contract and I cannot see into the future. I'm not thinking about leaving Naples.\"",

      "Adeyemi, 23, has failed to register a goal or assist since late September with just three goals to his name in 14 games across all competitions this season. The forward caught the ire of his manager during Dortmund's 1-0 win over Koln after throwing a water bottle at the bench when being taken off.",

      "According to BILD, the youngster's future is now in question with his contract expiring in 2027. It's Ruben Amorim 's side that have emerged as reported suitors for Adeyemi's services. Should the Red Devils succeed in enticing the German, it would be a move that the ex-Liverpool boss would have made himself during his time at Anfield.",
      "Adeyemi spent the first four years of his professional career with Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg, which included several loans to FC Liefering. It was in the 2021/22 season that he had his breakout year with 23 goals in 44 games.",
      "His exploits as a teenager led to much speculation around his future and it was according to BILD that Klopp was \"very interested\" in signing his compatriot. It was a move that didn't pan out with Adeyemi signing for Dortmund in the summer of 2022.",
      "United were also linked with signing Adeyemi three years ago but a move to one of England's biggest club would have been a mistake according to the president of the German's former club SpVgg Unterhaching, Manfred Schwabl.",
      "\"Liverpool and Manchester United are clubs that are desperate for such players. But it’s still far too early for that. Karim can influence that all by himself with the way he plays soccer, how he asserts himself in Dortmund, and also how he develops personally and continues to remain so down-to-earth.",
      "\"The English clubs as a whole are not only looking for good kickers, but also for players who they can market well and have both feet on the ground.\" If United opt to pursue the transfer, they'll be dealing with familiar faces as Adeyemi's agent is Jorge Mendes. The Portuguese powerhouse was behind the deals for Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Slovenian was ruled out of international duty after picking up a knock just prior to the international break. However, the Red Devils have attracted plaudits for their handling of the situation, albeit after a period of tension with Slovenia's FA.",
      "United are understood to be in hot pursuit of Sporting CP youngster Salvador Blopa, who is making some big waves back in Lisbon. One year after Amorim left the Estadio Jose Alvalade, the Red Devils boss could return to his former stomping ground for a promising new recruit.",
      "Blopa, 18, is supposedly seen as a potential long-term answer to United's woes at right wing-back, a role the club has struggled with in recent years. The likes of Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui have juggled responsibilities in the position this term, though neither has truly nailed their remit just yet.",
      "The Daily Mail reported the Red Devils can expect competition from Real Madrid in their pursuit of the teenage sensation. Blopa only made his first-team debut for Sporting last month, where he scored twice in a 5-1 Taca de Liga win over Alverca.",
      "The 6ft 2\" star is able to operate anywhere down the right side but may be considered somewhat raw to make the step up at Old Trafford just yet. United aren't understood to be prepping for a busy January transfer window, though the desperation to fill a gap in the team that sorely needs addressing may yet push them into action.",
      "An international incident almost unfolded this week, and it all stemmed from Sesko's recent injury disappointment. Or rather, Slovenia was supposedly less than impressed with the lack of communication it received from Old Trafford.",
      "Summer signing Sesko was forced off during the 2-2 draw against Tottenham last weekend despite coming off the bench himself. And it appeared the knock was serious enough given his withdrawal left the Red Devils to finish the game with 10 men.",
      "Cue comment from Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek, who was banking on his star to be fit ahead of key World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden. But despite his initial assertion demanding \"maximum respect\" after being left in the dark, he eventually played down the row after receiving word from Manchester.",
      "Kek even took aim at the English media for allegedly making more of the situation than was required. However, he holds no ill will towards United after they reached out.",
      "\"Completely expected from the English media,\" said Kek ahead of his side's crucial World Cup qualifier. \"But I emphasise once again: the moment communication was established between us and the Manchester United medical team, the problem was solved in five minutes.",
      "\"I thank the club for their cooperation. Our medical team checked their documentation. The matter was quickly resolved. I wish Benjamin a successful rehabilitation and a speedy return to the field, because everyone who knows him knows that he feels best there.\"",

      "Piers Morgan has slammed the \"ridiculous\" decision that saw Cristiano Ronaldo sent off during Portugal's match against the Republic of Ireland. Ronaldo was shown a red card on the hour mark as Portugal lost 2-0 in Dublin in the World Cup qualifier.",
      "The Al Nassr star was sent off for an elbow on Ireland defender Dara O'Shea, with the scoreline 2-0 in favour of the home side at the Aviva Stadium at the time of the red card. VAR checked the decision, and Ronaldo was given his marching orders, with the former Manchester United icon now in danger of missing the start of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Morgan, who recently published an in-depth interview with Ronaldo, has weighed in on the 40-year-old's red card against Ireland. The outspoken journalist and presenter issued a clear verdict on what he thought of the decision, with a post on X which read: \"Ridiculous that Ronaldo was sent off for resisting someone pulling his shirt back.\"",
      "Morgan then shared a clip of Lionel Messi involved in an altercation with an opposition player. He said: \"When Messi did exactly the same recently, nothing was done.\"",
      "Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson was also asked about Ronaldo's red card, including what the former United forward said to him after the forward was sent off. \"He [Ronaldo] complimented me for putting pressure on the referee,\" Hallgrimsson said.",
      "\"But listen, it had nothing to do with me, it was his action on the pitch that cost him a red card. It had nothing to do with me, unless I got into his head.”",
      "Ronaldo's red card means there is a chance that the forward could miss the start of next summer's World Cup in the United States.",
      "Portugal only have one more World Cup group stage qualifier left to play, and a ban of more than one match would see Ronaldo be suspended for the start of next summer's tournament across the Atlantic.",
      "The result of Portugal's next match against Armenia will determine if Ronaldo misses the start of the World Cup. If Portugal beat Armenia, they would progress automatically to next summer's tournament, but a draw or defeat could see Roberto Martinez's side forced to take part in a two-legged play-off to qualify for the competition.",
      "The length of Ronaldo's ban is yet to be confirmed, with a red card typically leading to a three-match suspension.",

      "They made enquiries with Brighton and Atletico Madrid over deals for Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher in the summer, but neither came to fruition. Already, United have been credited with interest in Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace and England and Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson.",
      "According to Mail Online, United are also monitoring Wolves ace Gomes, who signed a five-year deal with the relegation-threatened side in April. United may need to be flexible, with their Premier League rivals having more money at their disposal.",

      "This season, United are without European football and were knocked out from the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town, meaning their campaign has largely been centred on a one-match-per-week schedule in the Premier League. That will change when the top flight returns after the international break, when United will have to contend with a busy schedule over December and the festive period.",
      "Regardless, it seems that Amorim has already made a major impact on United's preparations for matches over his first 12 months in charge. According to a report in The Sun, Amorim has made some key changes at Carrington since his arrival last year.",
      "The report suggests that Amorim has made training sessions 'less intense' as matchday approaches. This adjustment was reportedly made in response to some players struggling with the high-intensity training under Ten Hag's regime.",
      "United have had a relatively small injury list this season, with Lisandro Martinez - who suffered a knee injury back in February - being the only long-term casualty. On 24th November, United will return to Premier League action after the international break, hosting Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "After the draw against Spurs, Amorim said: \"We have a lot of problems. We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",

      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe celebrated his 70th birthday, his colleagues put together a video containing messages from Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Eric Cantona.",
      "Cantona is Ratcliffe's favourite player. The British billionaire even named the company that acquired up to 29 per cent of United, Trawlers Limited, as a reference to his famous speech.",
      "Just a few months after Ineos' investment was signed off, Cantona was asked about the reference. He said he inspires a lot of people and described Ratcliffe as \"a legend in his business\".",
      "However, Ratcliffe might need to reconsider his favourite player after some bruising quotes from Cantona over the last year. Ratcliffe has thick skin, but Cantona has not held back when discussing the Ineos regime, and his comments might cut through due to the esteem in which Ratcliffe holds him.",
      "Speaking at the 'Eric The King Cantona' evening, he said: “I have many other passions and projects, but I thought that for two or three years I could maybe put those to the side and try to give something to this club, which has given everything to me. But [Ratcliffe] didn’t seem interested.",
      "“I did what I had to do, so I don’t feel guilty anymore. I tried my best. Sir Alex Ferguson created a style of beautiful attacking football, which the new owners should have used. Instead, they destroyed it.”",
      "Earlier this year, he said: \"I support United because I really love United, but now if I was a fan and I had to choose a club I don't think I would choose United. Because I don't feel close to these kind of decisions. They [Ineos] have another strategy, another project. Do you feel close to this project? I don't think so.",
      "\"The soul of the team and the club is not in the players - all the people around is like a big family. I remember a dressing room with players and Sir Alex Ferguson. All these people you don't know helped us to feel at home and be in a family. It's very important to respect these people like you respect your manager and teammates.",
      "\"Since Ratcliffe arrived, it's the complete opposite. He doesn't want Sir Alex Ferguson as an ambassador any more. He is more than a legend and I think we have to find this soul again. This team of directors, they try to destroy everything. They don't respect anybody. They even want to change the stadium.\"",
      "Cantona and Ratcliffe are complete opposites, and it would be interesting to learn whether the latter can detach Cantona the man from Cantona the player after his latest round of criticism.",
      "Ratcliffe wants to build a new stadium and Cantona has pleaded to stay at Old Trafford. Ratcliffe believes United's redundancies were necessary and Cantona feels the club's identity has been destroyed.",
      "Ratcliffe will not have to react and change his favourite player if he can separate the two. He may be able to disagree with Cantona's opinions, but still be able to look back on his playing career with fondness.",
      "On the other hand, Ratcliffe's opinion could change due to Cantona's criticism. Imagine finding out that your favourite player appears to actively dislike you? Not many fans are faced with that.",
      "The birthday video Ratcliffe received for his 70th might have been deleted, and he may feel slightly embarrassed that he publicly gushed over Cantona when he was looking to invest in United.",
      "“Eric transformed the club… he had presence. He was the figurehead of Manchester United,\" Ratcliffe said during an interview. The naming of 'Trawlers Limited' was the ultimate tribute to the Frenchman.",
      "Ratcliffe has copped plenty of flak from United fans and was confronted after United's visit to Craven Cottage at the beginning of the year due to the decision to increase ticket prices.",
      "United made the mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game in the Premier League. \"66 quid, you're taking the p***. You're worse than the Glazers, sort it out,\" a fan said to him.",
      "Cantona bemoaned corporate power in football during his recent tour. “I went to Old Trafford last season for the game against Manchester City, and I thought it was quiet,\" he said.",
      "\"United fans prefer to go to away matches, to be with the real fans, than to be surrounded by people who come from different parts of the world just to go to the merchandise store.",
      "“We have to be closer to the real things of football, to the working people. Football is a working-class game – it’s important we don’t lose that. If I lived in England, I would prefer to be a fan of a club in the third or fourth division.",
      "\"I don’t find the energy that we had in the past. It’s not the fault of the fans, it’s the fault of the people who are in charge of the clubs – the economic system.”",
      "Ratcliffe won't buy a ticket to attend an evening with Cantona any time soon.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window was as much about selling players as it was buying them.",
      "Yes, the Reds needed to ensure that reinforcements were brought in but the right players had to be let go to balance the books. There is always a risk when choosing to let players leave that you will suddenly be put into a position where you regret that decision.",
      "But when you look at the three major departures in the summer, you have to say that United can reassuredly state that they got it right. Take Alejandro Garnacho for example.",
      "He left United under a cloud due to his antics off the field. His performances on the pitch were not much better last season but there was a sense that his potential was untapped.",
      "United's lack of wingers in the 3-4-2-1 system left Garnacho without a home under Ruben Amorim and you felt that if he found the right club, the Argentine could move from strength-to-strength. And yet his sluggish start at Chelsea suggests United are not missing out on too much by choosing to back Amorim over him.",
      "His only Premier League goal came against Sunderland and arguably his best performance was against a struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers side. Not quite the redemption arc Garnacho was hoping for.",
      "However, it is not just those struggling at their new clubs who are proving United right. Marcus Rashford has undeniably excelled during his loan spell at Barcelona.",
      "The forward has rediscovered that form which had so many fans excited when he burst onto the scene at Old Trafford. It was clear Rashford needed to leave United after his relationship with Amorim broke down.",
      "The fear from a United perspective was that if the relationship with Amorim was over and Rashford did not perform for Barca, options would begin to dry up as the Reds looked to sell him. Ultimately, United need the money going into the next summer transfer window and selling him to a club that is not a direct rival remains the ideal solution. Fortunately, his good form means it is likely Barca will trigger their option to buy him.",
      "Finally, there is Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane left United when Benjamin Sesko arrived and while it was not ideal for him to depart with so few centre-forwards at the club, Hojlund is proving that decision right too.",
      "The 22-year-old at Napoli has more goals than Sesko so far this season but Hojlund is not overshadowing his successor. Sesko is showing signs at United of what he can do that Hojlund couldn't. He is stronger holding the ball up and brings supporting players, particularly the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, into the game better.",
      "Would you like to see Sesko scoring more goals? Of course. But he is a work in progress and has not left United fans wishing for Hojlund to return and regretting any of these decisions taken.",
      "That's the biggest positive the Reds can take from their major summer exits. United have parted ways with them at just the right time.",

      "Manchester United are credited with an interest in Wolve's Joao Gomes ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Football Insider claim that United are one of a few clubs 'plotting' a move for the Wolves man.",

      "Turkey vs Bulgaria (5pm) -Altay Bayindir",

      "“He’s got everything,” he said.",
      "“He has a physique that cannot be improved, can run insanely fast, you can’t push him away, and he is aggressive in his game. He’s the whole package.",
      "“But he is a young man who, compared to Joakim Mæhle, has not been in so many decisive situations, and he is naturally building up that experience at the moment.”",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has been named on the bench for Turkey's World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria.",
      "Turkey look set for a place in the play-offs with the nation three points behind Spain in the group. They also have a much worse goal-difference, meaning that Spain will have to lose vs Georgia, with a goal swing of 12.",
      "Bayindir has 10 caps for the nation so far, but has played back-up in the qualifcation campaign.",

      "My name is Amie and I will be taking you through this afternoon and evening, brigning you the latest Manchester United news.",
      "First, here's a look at some of the things that you may have missed so far today.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe might suddenly be at war with his favourite Manchester United player",
      "Manchester United wonderkid scores for England after Thomas Tuchel decision",
      "Man United's transfer priority decision with trio lined up as part of 'good business'",
      "Premier League's 'best' tells Manchester United he is 'working on' transfer",
      "Manchester United are in the market for at least TWO important midfield signings, and it is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson who tops their wish-list.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No1 priority to rebuild the Reds squad, while Brighton's Carlos Baleba is the other big deal in the pipeline, as per the Mirror.",
      "Anderson is expected to cost less than £100m-rated Baleba so the England man is seen as a good piece of potential business. United have also been interested in Conor Gallagher should he be available for a loan in January from Atletico Madrid as he looks to earn a World Cup spot.",
      "United are said to have no chance of recalling Rasmus Hojlund during the winter transfer window.",
      "Fabrizio Romano said in a recent YouTube video:",
      "No chance for Hojlund to return to Man United in January, despite some rumours in England. Rasmus Hojlund feels like a Napoli player, not a Man United player on loan. So it’s completely over between Hojlund and Manchester United, and again, my expectation is for Napoli to sign Hojlund on a permanent transfer.",
      "So the obligation to buy will be activated, and Man United will receive a €50 million package for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Also, Sesko's injury is not that serious; it’s not an ACL, it’s not a very long injury, and so Man United don’t need to have an emergency solution in January.",
      "Milan and Roma are reportedly still interested in Joshua Zirkzee, despite recent reports stating that United has ruled out the possibility of the forward leaving this winter.",
      "The Sun made those claims yesterday. However, today's edition of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera says the Serie A sides remain keen.",
      "Daniel Munoz has admitted it would be a dream to play for United.",
      "The Crystal Palace has told AS Colombia:",
      "First of all, I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another; it would be a dream to play for one of these clubs, whether it's Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United. I think I'm working towards that; I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because for me, it's a dream to get there.\"",
      "I don't have concrete information that any of these clubs are interested in me. My focus is on Crystal Palace; we'll see when the winter transfer window gets closer. Right now, I'm totally focused on these two matches with the national team.",
      "United are said to have had a scout present when Stade Rennais beat Paris FC last week.",
      "Rennes-based journalist Francois Rauzy claims they were there to watch Jeremy Jacquet and Mohamed Kader Meite. Breel Embolo replaced the latter midway through the second half and went on to score the winner.",
      "United reportedly could be in the mix to sign Quinten Timber.",
      "CaughtOffside also credits Arsenal and West Ham United with an interest in the Netherlands international, whose Feyenoord contract expires at the end of this season. Borussia Dortmund, however, are said to be leading to race for the twin brother of Jurrien Timber.",
      "United are said to have told Joshua Zirkzee there is \"no chance\" he will be leaving the club this winter.",
      "The Sun claims they are prepared to block requests to leave because of the Africa Cup of Nations. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are due to represent Cameroon and the Ivory Coast at AFCON.",
      "Ghana are, though, preparing for the World Cup, playing Japan in a friendly yesterday, with South Korea to come on Tuesday. That means it might be better to pursue Antonie Semenyo during the January window rather than any delays to a deal with Bournemouth next summer because of the tournament",
      "Carlos Baleba will not be playing for Cameroon at the World Cup and thus may be more likely to move during the summer transfer window.",
      "Cameroon lost to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the African qualification play-off, so Andre Onana, Baleba and Bryan Mbeumo will be absent for next year's tournament. However, for Baleba and Onana, that gives them more time to focus on their futures.",
      "Thanks for joining us this weekend as our coverage of the latest United transfer news continues. January 1 is just six-and-a-half weeks away, and rumours regarding the winter transfer window are already in full swing.",
      "Carlos Baleba was the one who got away in the summer. Will United revive their interest in him?",
      "Antoine Semenyo has started this season on fire for Bournemouth. Will the club raid their Premier League rivals as they did to Brentford and Wolverhampton Wanderers for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha?",
      "Follow along throughout the day as the final international break of this season comes and goes."

      "Manchester United will find it difficult not to look on enviously at Barcelona this season considering how well Marcus Rashford has done for them.",
      "The loan spell to Catalonia was the last throw of the dice for Rashford. His bridges were burnt with Ruben Amorim and, for all involved, the best thing to do was to let him leave.",
      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",
      "He joined the Camp Nou club on a season-long loan with the option to purchase him in the summer. If all goes according to plan for United, Rashford will impress, Barca will trigger that option and the winger's time in Spain continues.",
      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "With that in mind, United know what they can't do. Sell Rashford to a Premier League rival. In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",
      "If he was to impress in the Premier League, suddenly Rashford becomes a more prominent issue for the United head coach. So ideally United must find a way of making things work with Barca. The alternative of him returning to England with Chelsea or Spurs is not worth thinking about.",
      "United can only hope that if it comes to it, Rashford still does not fancy a move down to London...",

      "Diego Leon believes it's \"huge\" for Paraguay to have a player from the country who represents Manchester United.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign the young defender.",
      "Before Leon travelled to Manchester, he spoke to local journalists at an airport in Paraguay, saying: “I’m going to kill it in the pre-season, and within one or two games, I’ll already be playing with them [first-team].\"",
      "The youngster's transfer made headlines in his homeland and Leon discussed the impact of his move.",
      "\"For Paraguay, to have a player playing here at United is huge,\" he told club media. \"I think for Paraguayans they’re very proud to have someone from there playing in a club as big as Manchester United.",
      "\"It is an amazing, unique feeling to represent your country for all the people of Paraguay. I don’t know, it has no explanation - for my family it is an immense sense of pride to see me play with my national team.\"",
      "Leon was asked to describe Paraguay to those unfamiliar with the country. \"The people of Paraguay will surprise you. They’re so kind, even if they don’t have much, they will always help you,\" he said.",
      "The 18-year-old impressed coaches at Carrington upon his arrival and was named in the pre-season tour squad. Ruben Amorim has named Leon in matchday squads against Grimsby Town, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland this season, but he has not made his senior debut.",
      "In August, there was a sense among academy staff that Leon would benefit from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches when he had been exclusively working with the first-team.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The left-back is still considered raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer arrival.",
      "Under-21 manager Travis Binnion was recently asked about Leon and explained: \"It is evident for all to see he has some real qualities and some strong foundations to his game that he has to build on.",
      "\"He is aware, we are all aware, he has stuff to work on but to be fair to the kid, he has not played a full 90 minutes yet. We will be looking to tick that off pretty soon and that will be really good for him.",
      "\"If he can get a run of 90 minutes, then it is fair to look at his game and see where he is at. At this moment in time he has shown real glimpses of promise and has fitted in with the group really well.\"",

      "Chelsea legend Pat Nevin believes Conor Gallagher would be a \"perfect\" signing for Manchester United, with the club previously linked to the midfielder.",
      "Gallagher is reportedly viewed by United as a 'Plan B', with Brighton's Carlos Baleba their top target. One obstacle United may face with Baleba is the staggering £100m price tag Brighton have reportedly placed on the 21-year-old.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side could save a significant amount of money by moving for the former Chelsea midfielder instead. Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo recently claimed that Atletico Madrid would listen to offers in the region of £52m.",
      "Former Scottish international Nevin believes Gallagher wouldn't just be a strong signing for Amorim, but that he would also greatly benefit United skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He told CasinoHawks: \"I think Conor Gallagher would be great at Man Utd, in my opinion. Gallagher can play a number of positions. Remember Gallagher can play in a 3-4-2-1 formation. It wouldn't be the best as one of the wing-backs, but as one of the two in the central four.",
      "\"So you're talking about the two central midfielders or one of the two ahead as well. If you put him in one of the two more holding positions with his energy, his battling, it kind of frees Bruno Fernandes a wee bit to go a bit further forward, because he's been having to come back a few games, hasn't he? Playing in a more defensive place.",
      "\"The energy levels that Connor's got would be perfect which again makes you ask why they sold Scott McTominay.",
      "\"But the other thing about Connor, if you actually have to play him one further forward, there are very few in the game that are better in a high-pressing game.",
      "\"There are very few in football that can do better than him. He's brilliantly suited to the English game.",
      "\"If Manchester United have had a problem for quite some time, one of the biggest problems they've had is energy in midfield. With the best will in the world, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen were lovely players, fantastic world-class players, but they didn't have legs by the end.",
      "\"Certainly Casemiro still hasn't got the legs to do that three games a week. That's clear, that's obvious. So you need somebody in there who's got that. I would be looking at those central positions, to be honest.\"",
      "Gallagher joined Chelsea at the age of six and progressed through the academy into the first team. He spent four seasons out on loan before featuring regularly for the Blues in the Premier League, including spells at Charlton Athletic, Swansea City, West Brom and Crystal Palace.",
      "The Englishman moved to Atletico Madrid after being told he wouldn't be a regular starter under Enzo Maresca. Now, after his first full season in Spain, Gallagher could be set for a quick return to the Premier League.",

      "United also have their sights set on Nottingham Forest's England international, Anderson. His versatility in playing both as a defensive midfielder and an attacking one makes him a desirable target, and United are prepared to go all out to secure his services.",
      "The 23 year old Anderson has been turning heads with his stellar performances for both his club and country, and Forest are bracing themselves for a fight to retain him.",
      "However, Anderson is likely to come at a lower price than the £100m-rated Baleba, making him an attractive potential acquisition, so United see signing the England man as 'good business', as per the Mirror.",

      "After a summer of heavy investment, Amorim's team had a dismal start to the season, languishing in 14th place by the end of September. However, they've since bounced back, going five matches without defeat.",
      "Following a late stalemate against Tottenham in their most recent match, United now find themselves in seventh place in the league table. The Red Devils are set to return to the pitch next weekend, hosting Everton at Old Trafford.",

The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago.",

      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight.",
      "As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "However, The Sun have reported that this will not be the case as Zirkzee looks set to remain at Old Trafford. It has been claimed that the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of leaving United in the New Year.",
      "The report claims that the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which will be expected to see Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo be unavailable for several weeks, is influencing United's decision-making for the January window.",
      "It's because of this that Zirkzee has reportedly been told that a transfer in January will not be possible, with the expectation now that the forward will get more game time across December and January.",
      "Various reports have been claiming for some time that Zirkzee would seek a chance to leave United in January in search of more regular first-team football, but if the latest article is accurate then that may not be possible.",

      "The Three Lions' U21 manager, Lee Carsley, said Lacey was a player who England \"rate highly.\"",
      "Speaking after his goal against Japan, Lacey reflected on the team's performance and said he was now targeting a permanent call-up to the England U21 set-up after playing for the U20s.",
      "\"It was good,\" Lacey told independent journalist Tom Jolley. \"I thought it was a good game, Japan are a good team, but we took our chance when we got it. We let it slip at the end, but there are lessons to take.",
      "\"You could see they were very technical and they worked hard. I thought we defended well and just let it go at the end.",
      "\"It's good to play with new players and try click with them. Everyone is a good player here - it's England - but it's getting everyone playing together and getting used to each other, with it being the first time playing together, but you can see the ability that everyone has.\"",
      "Lacey added about training with the U21 age group: \"It's good to join them. Some of the players are top players playing in top leagues and playing every week, so it was good to join them, but hopefully you want to get the call-up permanently and stay around it.\"",
      "In the last few years, footage of Lacey playing for United's academy has gone viral on social media and such clips have amassed thousands of views.",
      "Lacey was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter and grew up idolising multi-Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.",
      "He has predominately played on the right wing, but coaches in the academy like to challenge youngsters in different positions across the attack and Lacey is a versatile player.",

      "Manchester United youngster Shea Lacey scored for England Under-20s against Japan on Friday.",
      "Lacey came on from the bench in the 60th minute against Japan. The youngster opened the scoring after he received the ball on the edge of the box and found the left corner with an accurate strike.",
      "Japan secured a 1-1 draw thanks to a late goal during added time at the Eco-Power Stadium.",
      "Lacey's strike against Japan represented his first goal for England U20s following his maiden call-up to that age group last month. The 18-year-old was also given the opportunity by Thomas Tuchel to train with England's senior team at St. George's Park during the October international break.",
      "The forward's performances have caught the attention of England Under-21 boss Lee Carsley.",
      "Carsley told the Daily Mail: \"He's been in the pathway a good amount of time now and he's a player that we rate highly.",
      "\"It worked out well that we needed that position for the training we were doing and Shea was more than happy to come over and train with the Under-21s.",
      "\"You can see he's a good talent. I know he's struggled with injuries in the past, which has probably held back his development, but I think it's so important we don't rush these young players, we let them develop in their own time.",
      "\"I think he trained two sessions with us and I enjoyed having him.\"",
      "\"He is in the same sort of area as Chido because of time lost. Different to Chido, Chido is fast progression. Because of time lost with Shea, he still has lots to come tactically, physically and mentally.",
      "\"Everybody can see - you have to be blind not to see - the talent he's got. He's got lots to do in his game and he knows. We're still managing him physically because if he can stay on the pitch and can train every day, I think everyone thinks he could be a top, top player.\"",
      "United consider Lacey as a first-team prospect and they were protective of his minutes last season, wanting to ensure that the youngster did not suffer further small injury problems.",
      "Lacey has generated immense interest in the last few years and followers of the academy are excited about his potential.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the Manchester City star, Lacey's long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder.",

      "Ruben Amorim has enjoyed a turnaround at Manchester United after an awful start to the campaign.",
      "United crashed out of the Carabao Cup second round against Grimsby Town and were hammered 3-0 by Manchester City, which cranked up the pressure on Amorim.",
      "Amorim had not won back-to-back Premier League games since his arrival, but the United boss enjoyed an outstanding October, winning three games on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Here are how the players have rated so far this season:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "The bar was low to impress between the sticks, but Lammens has made a huge impact since his strong debut against Sunderland. The Belgium international has made a supremely confident start to life at Old Trafford, and the \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chants tell you how he has performed. 7",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "It was only a matter of time before Bayindir lost his first-choice status. He made a mistake against Arsenal on the opening day of the campaign and another error against Burnley at Old Trafford. Made some good saves against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, but still conceded three. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Has started every Premier League game on the left side of the back three. Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby, but he bounced back against Chelsea in the following week and hasn't really put a foot wrong since then. His passing has been a huge asset from the back. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire started on the bench for the first four games of the campaign. Technically recorded an assist against Chelsea and scored the matchwinner at Anfield. Maguire has produced some memorable moments during his United career, but he will look back on that goal with particular fondness. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "De Ligt has markedly improved this season. He is showing the kind of form that saw him earn a reputation as one of Europe's best defensive prospects, and he is delivering consistent performances each week. He is still the only United player to have played every minute in the Premier League. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests. Looked to have scored for United at Craven Cottage in August, but it was marked down as an own-goal. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "It's been a mixed bag for Dalot this season. Has recently been asked to play at left-wing back, and he didn't look comfortable in that role - he is better on the right - against Sunderland and Nottingham Forest. Was dropped to face Tottenham last weekend. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Dorgu looked sharp in pre-season and started the campaign full of confidence, but he has delivered some unconvincing performances and his end product around the box must improve. Dorgu did not start once during United's excellent run of three wins on the bounce throughout October. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Has played just over 200 minutes across five appearances this season due to injuries. Mazraoui performed well against Spurs last weekend and it felt harsh to remove him before the hour mark. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Heaven started against Grimsby in August when Blundell Park felt like hell. The youngster has made just two substitute appearances in the league, but he provided an assist in the 4-2 win against Brighton. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Has become hugely important this season. United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch and 15 when he has been off it. Also contributed goals against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, so he's been one of the standout performers. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes' performance against Tottenham encapsulated his season so far - he was poor but played the corner into the box for the equaliser. Has scored two goals and recorded three assists in total, but missed penalties against Fulham and Brentford. Could easily go up another level. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Looked bright without scoring when starting the first three matches of the campaign. Scored brilliantly to open the scoring against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Was far too weak when allowing Wilson Odobert to breeze past him for Tottenham's first goal last Saturday. Ugarte was off the pace against Grimsby and has struggled when introduced from the bench. 3",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Mainoo has not really made a negative or positive contribution due to his lack of involvement. Was absent against Spurs due to a knock, and hopefully that injury is nothing serious. 5",
      "Amad",
      "His relationship with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed as the season has developed. He assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and scored a stunning goal against Forest to salvage a point. Has delivered strong performances from right wing-back. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo is the current favourite to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. The Cameroon international was unstoppable before the international break and he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for October. Six goals in 12 appearances for United. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Has made a big impact since his arrival and scored his first goal for the club against Brighton, but Cunha would have liked to have more goals and assists to his name. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford. Built on that by scoring against Sunderland, but has failed to fire since that game in early October. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Can't mark Zirkzee higher or lower than a five - he hasn't started once. 5",

      "Before a ball was kicked, the narrative for Manchester United's clash with PSG had already been written.",
      "Mary Earps, rightly or wrongly, has dominated the headlines, and everyone was waiting to see how the night unfurled. When she emerged from the tunnel at Old Trafford, she received a rapturous reception from the early birds in the stadium.",
      "It was not a given, but was perhaps to be expected. What was not in the script was the boos that rung out every time she touched the ball in the game.",
      "To their credit, the United fans aimed to drown out the boos with cheers and, by the end, Earps had won them round. But thanks to their performance on the pitch, the Reds changed the narrative.",
      "Instead of talking about Earps, the main takeaway from last night's game was the performances of the players in red. Safia Middleton-Patel who managed to overcome the nerves of replacing Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who suffered a facial injury against Aston Villa, produced a decent display to help win the game.",
      "Her save at the start of the second half was top draw and one which United keepers of all codes would have been proud of. Melvine Malard, before being forced off with cramp, was superb leading the line and left Earps with no chance as she curled the ball beyond the former England No.1.",
      "Jayde Riviere was dynamic at right-back and her last-ditch tackles helped keep PSG at bay as they pushed for an equaliser. Jess Park did superbly well for the winner, linking up play with neat one-twos before Anna Sandberg crossed for Fridolina Rolfo to win the match.",
      "Earps may have dominated the build-up to this fixture, but it will be the United players who will be remembered when we look back at this game at the end of the season. United now sit third in the Champions League table, with women's powerhouses Barcelona and Lyon the only other teams to have 100% starts to the competition.",
      "Marc Skinner was beaming in his post-match press conference and he had every right to be. This United team has really gelled and you now have to wonder just how far they can go in both the Women's Super League and the Champions League.",
      "On the state of that performance, they have every right to think they can go deep into all of the competitions ahead of them.",

      "De Ligt previously explained how he is benefiting from having an uninterrupted pre-season in the summer, and he provided fresh insight into his consistent displays during an interview with NOS Sport.",

      "De Ligt was asked to explain his improvement and discussed the toll injuries had taken on his confidence.",
      "He said: “There are a few explanations for that. I’ve had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body. This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism [about his condition] anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "On his return to the Netherlands squad after being overlooked last month, the defender added: “If you’re not in the squad, it affects you. But the national coach decides. For me, it was important to stay true to myself and keep going. I think being selected again is a victory.\"",
      "Earlier in the week, Netherlands manager Koeman explained De Ligt's recall, saying: \"He didn't look confident in his play, and I told him so. He's calmer now, and I felt I should include him again.\"",
      "De Ligt was not included in the United leadership group that was introduced in the summer, but boss Ruben Amorim said the Dutchman leads by example when he spoke during his post-Spurs press conference.",

I think he is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well. I think he has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball.",

      "Former Manchester United and England goalkeeper Mary Earps was cheered by fans as she made her way out on to the pitch for Paris Saint-Germain's warm-up, before the goalkeeper was subject to a smattering of boos during the early stages of the Champions League match.",
      "Earps returned to Old Trafford for the first time this evening after leaving the club for the Parisians - in June 2024. The 32-year-old has made headlines in the past few weeks following the release of her book; 'All In'.",
      "An excerpt from that book caused controversy as she discussed a conversation she had with England head coach Sarina Wiegman about Chelsea star Hannah Hampton. It was claimed in the book that the goalkeeper, who helped England win Euro 2025, was criticised by Earps prior to the tournament.",
      "Earps alleged that Hampton was 'disruptive and unreliable' during Euro 2022 and is believed to have told Wiegman that the Dutch head coach was 'rewarding bad behaviour' by calling up the 24-year-old thereafter. These allegations were met with backlash from England fans and Earps has since spoken out to defend her comments.",
      "In a statement on Instagram following backlash, Earps said: \"It is not easy to be as vulnerable and open as I have been in the book, and I also understand that my honesty and rawness will divide opinion. That's okay, everyone is entitled to feel what they feel and I respect that.\"",
      "Speaking prior to the match, the goalkeeper admitted she expected a frosty reception at Old Trafford. That's not what played out on the night, at least pre-match, but Earps was booed when she took her first touch of the ball, even if the majority of fans tried to drown that out with further cheers!",
      "\"I'm probably expecting a little booing,\" she said. \"I hope it's a little bit, but it might be a lot.",
      "\"A few of the fans have come out to support me at PSG, but United is their No.1 team. I understand that.\"",
      "When asked about the prospect of Earps being booed, United head coach Marc Skinner also moved to ward off potential ill-will towards his former player. \"Deep down I know Mary is a good person,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm sure part of bringing out a book is bringing out controversial stuff that will help sell the book. I know that she has to defend that publicly.",
      "\"Knowing the human she is, I'm sure she will be getting criticism that she won't like. It's part of the other side of releasing a book.",
      "\"But she's a great person, she doesn't need me to say that really.",
      "\"I hope people toe the line with criticism, but I'm sure Mary understands the situation she's put herself in.",
      "\"She's on a platform where people are interested in what she says, so that's a credit to her and to her hard work. The goalkeeper we had at the start, to the one that left, was not the same person. She transformed.\"",
      "Once the whistle goes this evening, Earps will be hoping her performance will not leave the home fans so happy. United headed into the match with two wins from two matches in the Champions League - while PSG had yet to pick up a point in the competition this season.",

      "Manchester United Women have continued their 100 per cent record after a 2-1 victory over PSG at Old Trafford.",
      "Melvine Malard opened the scoring for United as she shrugged off a defender to curl the ball beyond Mary Earps. The Reds would have deserved to go into the break ahead however Olga Carmona had other ideas.",
      "Picking up the ball 25 yards out she fired right into the top corner to make it 1-1 at the break. But it was United who picked up the victory that they deserved when an excellent team move was finished by Fridolina Rolfo with a great header.",
      "The win keeps United's 100 per cent record intact while opponents PSG have lost all of their opening three games of the tournament.",
      "Catch up with updates from Old Trafford this evening in our live blog below;",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog",
      "United have nine points from nine available. Rolfo wins it for United with her header in the second half. PSG look like they are heading out of the Champions League.",
      "Le Tissier booked potentially for time wasting.",
      "Six minutes for United to hold on.",

      "Sandberg is carrying on which will be music to United ears",
      "Chagas OFF",
      "Morissaint ON",
      "Sandberg is on the ground and looks to have suffered cramp there.",
      "Malard is off and goes off limping. She acknowledged the crowd as she left the pitch so the hope will be her injury isn't too serious.",
      "Rolfo, Malard OFF",
      "Galton, Terland ON",

      "What a save by Middleton-Patel as Ebayilin is denied with fingertips onto the post.",
      "We are back underway with PSG kicking us off.",
      "Earps is out before her teammates and is cheered at the other end of the stadium. It has been a mixed reception for her tonight",
      "United would have been deservedly ahead at the break. Malard's curling effort gave Earps no chance. However, Carmona has just produced a goal of the season contender to make it 1-1 at half time",
      "PSG level. Carmona with a beauty. She picks the ball up 25 yards out and curls it into the top corner. In fairness to PSG, that was special.",
      "Sandberg looks to pick out the corner but goes wide.",
      "We will have three additional minutes. As the board goes up, Rolfo is just recovering from a tackle.",
      "Ajibade goes for a cross that turns into a shot. Middleton-Patel parries it and it clips the crossbar. She had to be alert seconds later to get a foot on Leuchter's cross",
      "Awujo goes to fire it towards goal, miss-hits it. It falls to Park who fires over.",
      "Karchaoui booked after bringing down Park on the right flank",
      "Ball across the centre is sliced over her own bar by Le Tissier. The captain looked nervous there",
      "Wow what a goal. Malard with it. She is too strong for her defender, cuts inside and fires home. Superb"

      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is nestled between high-rise flats when you leave the overground White Hart Lane station.",
      "The glass facade and sleek design immediately catch the eye. It looks almost as if a spaceship from a faraway galaxy has docked in north London and you can't approach quickly enough.",
      "Manchester United visited Tottenham last weekend and I made my first visit to their stadium. I'd been repeatedly told it was the best arena in the country and it didn't fall short of that billing.",
      "Although the security staff took their time to admit the press into the media suite, it was worth the wait, as the press facilities and food offerings are second to none in the Premier League.",
      "The press food at Stamford Bridge is excellent, but Tottenham edges their London neighbours. The 12.30pm kick-off meant a full breakfast was on offer and the selection was superb for a media suite.",
      "The press room itself was akin to a luxury hotel reception. There was ample working space, comfortable leather-padded seats and Spurs offer lockers for journalists to store bags.",
      "The walk from the media suite to the press box is sign-posted - you could easily get lost on the way - and the interior of the ground is even more impressive than the exterior.",
      "Tottenham left White Hart Lane in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, and moved to their new 61,000-seater venue three years later. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new 100,000-seater Old Trafford by 2030 and there are a few lessons to be learned from Tottenham.",
      "The design of the stadium is outstanding. You feel like you're working in a special arena throughout your visit, and architecture firm Populous deserved all the plaudits they received.",
      "From a journalist's perspective, the press box is spacious and well-positioned, offering a good vantage point, while the media auditorium is a superb space for managers to conduct their post-match duties.",
      "Ratcliffe wants the new Old Trafford, set to be designed by Foster + Partners, to be the greatest arena in the world, and they will deliver if the rebuild is anything like Tottenham's home.",
      "Tottenham's stadium was rebuilt 170 yards away from where White Hart Lane stood, which means the feeling of the old ground hasn't been totally lost, and the new Old Trafford will seek to retain that 'feeling'.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is designed to maximise supporter experience and it brings fans closer to the pitch than at any comparable-sized stadium in the United Kingdom.",
      "The distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres to 7.9 metres, and the single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK with a capacity of 17,500 people.",
      "The steep South Stand is remarkable. It was designed with the hope that it would generate an intimidating atmosphere, but no such noise was produced during the game on Saturday.",
      "Like a lot of big clubs in the Premier League, Spurs have become a tourist attraction, which means there were hundreds of fans with tickets in that stand who did not contribute to the atmosphere.",
      "That is their prerogative and 'tourist fans' are still valued fans, but local Tottenham season ticket holders have argued their South Stand should be a designated area for supporters looking to create noise.",
      "The Stretford End is currently that stand within Old Trafford, and United should consider introducing a designated singing section to ensure an atmosphere can be created in the new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "I was fortunate enough to visit White Hart Lane before it was demolished. It was an ageing ground and Spurs were right to move on, but it could be intimidating for the opposition.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur stadium is not intimidating. It feels welcoming. United need to ensure they don't fall into the same trap.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Crystal Palace defender Daniel Munoz has revealed that playing for Premier League rivals Man Utd in the future would be a “dream”.",
      "Munoz was named as Player of the Match as Crystal Palace beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup final in May last season.",
      "The Eagles star is now regarded as one of the best right-backs in the Premier League with his brilliant form last term earning him a new contract until the summer of 2028.",
      "Munoz, who joined Crystal Palace in a bargain £6.8m deal from Belgian side Genk in January 2024, is currently on international dity with Colombia ahead of a friendly match against New Zealand in Florida.",
      "Speaking ahead of the game in the USA on Saturday, Munoz revealed that Man Utd, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain would all be “dream” destinations in the future.",
      "Munoz told a press conference: “Everything I hear out there, all the talk about one club or another, if you ask me, for me it would be a dream to play for one of these clubs.",
      "READ: Chelsea beat Liverpool to ‘best player of his age in South America’ with five deals worth more than £56m confirmed",
      "“Whether it’s Barcelona, ​​PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United, I work towards that, I strive every day, so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of one of these clubs because it’s a dream for me.",
      "“But the truth is that I’m focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace, and I’m not really aware of what’s being said on social media.",
      "“I don’t have any information that any of these clubs want me or are interested in me. These days my focus is on Crystal Palace and, obviously, here with the national team.”",
      "Genk first-team coach Michel Ribeiro is not surprised by the intensity of Munoz’s play since moving to the Premier League with the right-back known for “going forward like an animal”.",
      "“You need to run so much to keep up with him.",
      "“Our head scout, Dirk Schoofs, would always ask me to take a look at this guy or that guy.",
      "“We had been following Daniel for quite some time. After the first game of his that I watched, my recommendation immediately was to take him. Why? Because they were winning 3-0 in the 92nd minute and he was still going forward like an animal.",
      "“He can always sniff the right moment to attack the back post or be on the backs of the central defenders of the opponent, ready to pick up tap-ins or second balls. He has a feel for that and he also had the hunger and desire to score.”",
      "Ribeiro added: “I was surprised bigger clubs didn’t come in for him at Genk. Even now I’m surprised, with all the respect to Crystal Palace, that one of the top clubs in England hasn’t picked him up because he has a fantastic work ethic and attitude and he could help anywhere, at any club in the country.”"

During his sole season in Spain, he retained his England place and duly netted six times in 11 matches. That included a hat-trick in a win over Colombia in May 2005 – six days after former club Liverpool had lifted the Champions League.",

      "Lazio (12)",
      "In total, 34 of Gascoigne’s 57 caps came while he was playing club football outside of England. He earned more caps in three years at Rangers (22) than in four with Tottenham (20), as well as 12 at Lazio and three with Middlesbrough. He was sadly never even called up while at Chinese second-tier side Gansu Tianma, despite boasting a record of two goals in four games.",

      "Paul Gascoigne emerged from the 1990 World Cup as a global superstar, but he was not the only England player to impress sufficiently to earn a move to Italy. In the same summer Gazza left Tottenham for Lazio, Walker departed his Nottingham Forest home to try his luck at Sampdoria. His time in Serie A was not quite so memorable, with Sven-Goran Eriksson playing him out of position at right-back in his only year outside of England, but he did keep his international place.",

He headed to America at the end of the 1977/78 season with Birmingham, returned to become the first £1m footballer with Nottingham Forest in February 1979, then went back to Detroit that summer, never fully losing his grip on an England place.",

      "AC Milan (22)",
      "Far from damaging his England prospects, Wilkins found that his candle shone brighter away from the spotlight. He made nine and ten international appearances in 1985 and 1986 respectively – his two full calendar years in Italy. Only in 1982 (12) did he play more often for his country.",

Much like James Rodriguez earned a move to Real Madrid with his exploits in 2014, Spain’s other giant saw fit to bring in Gary Lineker in 1986.

      "United had an influx of forward talent in the summer. Of their spend of around £170million, the vast majority went on improving the forward line.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed to improve the attack, and that’s clearly had an impact, with the Red Devils netting 19 goals in the Premier League so far – only the top three have scored more.",
      "The signings have meant for far fewer opportunities for Joshua Zirkzee this season. The Dutchman was signed last summer but struggled in his debut season, netting only seven goals in more than 40 games.",
      "This term, it’s clear he’s not fancied, playing only 90 minutes across five appearances in all competitions.",
      "But still, The Sun reports he’s been told there is ‘no chance’ he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with United ready to ‘block requests’ from a number of players to depart mid-season.",
      "It’s explained that part of the reason United don’t want to let some players go in January is that they’ll lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to the African Cup of Nations over the winter.",
      "With Mbeumo going and Sesko having sustained an injury against Tottenham – though it’s not thought to be serious – there could be more minutes for Zirkzee.",
      "United would not want to struggle up top due to a lack of availability having let Zirkzee leave.",
      "The injury sustained by Sesko, meanwhile, has caused tension between United and Slovenia, with the national team not happy about their doctors not being able to look at the striker’s injury.",
      "While the documentation has now been sent to Slovenia, manager Matjaz Kek initially said: “With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents.",
      "“We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don’t have just anyone in this position.",
      "“I cannot comment, of course I have certain information and I am also in contact with Beni. I can’t say anything because officially we don’t know anything at all.",
      "“United haven’t contacted anyone from our camp. Of course, I am concerned about the player. The only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing.",

      "“Whether he has anyone to choose from in the backroom is another matter. In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell.”",
      "Whether Amass is given many opportunities in the United first team remains to be seen. He’s played just seven senior games for the club, but is impressing at Wednesday, where reports suggest he will be staying until the end of the campaign.",

Casemiro did it. Casemiro did a fantastic job, working hard and becoming, once again, a crucial player for this manager.",
      "“So, in this moment, he is really important for Rúben Amorim, but there will be a conversation about his contract because, at the moment, the numbers of his contract, salary, is way too high for Manchester United to extend that.”",
      "Romano added: “This is for Casemiro and for Harry Maguire, or the player could leave on a free.",

      "In football, as in comedy and indeed life itself, timing is everything. And this season Newcastle’s timing is absolutely terrible.",
      "It started in the summer, with a mess that was not particularly of their own making but a mess nonetheless. The late-summer explosion of Alexander Isak Saga was terrible timing.",
      "There is no good time for that kind of shenanigans, but your man Macbeth had it right: If it were done when ‘tis done, then ‘twere well it were done quickly.",
      "Shakespeare scholars remain divided on whether the daft Scottish over-thinker had protracted transfer sagas specifically in mind there, but there’s no doubting that once the outcome of the Isak caper was clearly not going to go Newcastle’s way, it would have been far less painful had it all played out earlier in the summer. Had Newcastle had time to put a proper plan in place.",
      "We’ve all had our fun at the saltiness pouring out of Bayern Munich’s unhappiness at Newcastle paying such crazy money for Nick Woltemade, because Bayern believe they have a divine right to hoover up all good German players should they wish to do so. But they did have a little bit of a point. It was a wild amount of money spent in a wild fashion.",
      "He isn’t really the right profile of striker for Newcastle’s football, but his purchase was one of pure desperation. A transfer about optics as much as it was about football. Newcastle had to look like they were doing something to address the cavernous hole being left in their gameplan, even if what they did wasn’t really a great idea.",
      "It is to Woltemade’s enormous credit and just in general quite funny that despite it all, and despite Newcastle’s wider struggles, that he has fared at least as well as and in several cases – including above all Isak’s – far better than any of the other big-money final-piece-of-the-puzzle strikers signed over the summer.",
      "But Newcastle’s bad timing in the summer has reared its head again. If challenged to sum up Newcastle’s Premier League season in a word we would, until the last couple of weeks, have gone for ‘nondescript’. Not good, not bad, not particularly noticeable one way or the other.",
      "They hadn’t had the same result in successive games and were kind of chugging along in that big pack of teams in mid-table. The eye-catching stuff was coming in the Champions League and in their Carabao defence.",

And to add to the embarrassment, that means now sitting below the Big Six’s two resident banter clubs, Spurs and Manchester United, even after a weekend where those two both spent their time being too daft even to pull off a win against the other.",
      "The worst thing for Liverpool, really, is that the run of bad results has felt far more compelling than the run of good results. That five-game winning run that kicked off their title defence involved far too much seat-of-the-pantsery. Had it been delivered by anyone other than the champions themselves, nobody would have been particularly taken in by wins that so often required desperately late goals and quite often getting out of jail after throwing away leads in ridiculous circumstances.",
      "Their recent run of defeats, though? That’s felt far less forced. Sure, it’s also involved some more late drama, but generally a side outplayed and outthought. And it’s a wide variety of sides they’ve now shown themselves vulnerable against.",

Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate are both struggling, performing way below previous levels. Milos Kerkez has found the Premier League far harder at Anfield than he did at the Vitality.",

Even the success Postecoglou did enjoy with Spurs in the Europa League involved, towards the end, precious little of anything that looked much like Angeball.",
      "By the time Forest came to their senses, Postecoglou’s winless run had plunged them so deep into a relegation fight that having been hubristic enough to believe they were above such mundane concerns had to accept they had no other concern at all. A season that should have been about trying to take the next step up the ladder towards English football’s actual elite with a really capable squad is now all about avoiding relegation under the ultimate firefighter himself, Sean Dyche.",

      "This kind of predictable unpredictability is great for the rest of us, especially with Fulham apparently unable to deliver their usual sterling work on this front this season, but probably gets a bit annoying after a while for fans. It could be a lot worse, obviously, but beating the teams they’ve beaten and not even having a top-half spot to currently show for it does feel a bit daft.",

      "We’re being very harsh and perhaps extremely greedy here but… should Palace actually be doing a bit better?",
      "Sure, they’re in the middle of the greatest period in their entire history, but it has now become slightly incongruous to see a team and manager who have had their balls so relentlessly tickled for so very long now sitting in mid-table below some very, very stupid clubs.",
      "They are obviously a very good team with a very good manager doing very good things. But they are still tenth, and that just feels vaguely underwhelming somehow.",
      "Which itself, of course, is pretty strong evidence for the extent of Palace’s recent overachievement. This is the club that famously finished 12th every year with 40-something points. That exceeding that already feels a little meh does highlight just how good they’ve got. And how fast.",
      "",
      "Got to laugh, haven’t you? They are really, really trying to be a sensible team under a sensible manager, but it just refuses to happen. Still impossible to know whether they are or will be good under Thomas Frank, still not much easier to know what ‘good’ actually looks like for Spurs this season. What’s the actual aim? The point?",
      "That long-awaited trophy win has brought so much joy but robbed the club of what had become its driving focus over the last few years. Throw that into a club in such a state of on-field and off-field flux, and the uncertainty and instability is understandable. The fans aren’t just at a loss to know what constitutes success this season; in a post-Levy world they don’t even know where to aim their ire if they don’t get it.",
      "How much the swirling uncertainty plays a part in their wildly differing home and away form is hard to measure, but it feels too clear to ignore altogether. Only rock-bottom misery-bound Wolves have a worse home record than Spurs. Nobody has a better away record.",
      "It does seem unlikely that both those things remain true for long; the key will be which moves more compelling toward the other. It’s Spurs so we don’t really know – and we genuinely wouldn’t bat an eye at the sight of them finishing fifth or 15th this season – but you the nagging suspicion is that it’s the away form that will shift most.",
      "That’s what the eye test and data all suggest. Another good Spurs bit this season is that they remain relentless xG botherers. According to the boffins they should have scored way fewer and conceded way more goals than is in fact the case.",
      "Now significantly overperforming their xG is nothing new to Spurs. Historically it’s been because, in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, this profoundly silly club possessed two of the most profoundly sensible finishers. When your two main goalscorers both consistently, year after year, exceed their xG then it should come as no surprise that a) you as a team will exceed your xG more often than not or more widely that b) playing with that outcome in mind becomes not just understandable but advisable.",
      "All perfectly logical and explainable. So how do we explain what’s happening now? How do we explain that a team that struggles to create pretty much anything is still wildly exceeding its xG while its most reliable finisher is a f***ing centre-back?",
      "And the only explanation that really works is, simply: Spurs, that.",
      "",
      "We couldn’t understand them as a football club, so we simply stopped trying and started treating them as something else.",
      "Which is fine everywhere except here, because how to rank the mood at so unfathomable a club? Third in the league and not technically out of title contention despite themselves is pretty good, though, and especially for a team that clearly has levels it’s not yet reaching.",
      "They’re not even as inconsistent as you think they are, not really. The defeat to Sunderland was maddening and avoidable, but it’s also the only defeat in a nine-game run across three competitions that features seven wins. The draw in that run? A really daft one as well, obviously, against Qarabag in the Champions League.",
      "They do appear determined to just chuck one of those games in every now and then to keep us all guessing, keep us all on our toes.",
      "",
      "A couple of hefty defeats, at Manchester City and then particularly at Aston Villa, have just harshed the buzz a bit for the Cherries, but from where they were in the summer to where they are now is still pretty crazy.",
      "We’re not sure anyone should really be able to cope with losing the players Bournemouth have lost with so apparently few consequences. This led us to believe some kind of witchcraft was involved, and we now believe losing 4-0 at Aston Villa to be an over-cautious act of misdirection and deception designed to put us all off the scent.",
      "It won’t work, Andoni. We’re entirely crazy, and you’ve just if anything made us more suspicious. We’re watching you.",
      "",
      "So, are they good now, or what? We demand to be told.",
      "Our gut feeling is that they still aren’t actually good, but they are no longer at least actively bad. They’ve been slightly fortunate at various points across this redemptive run of results, and quite how much they’ve benefited from the gentle luxury of a one-game-a-week schedule granted by their own incompetence might become clearer in December when they join everyone else in overindulging through the Busy Festive Period.",
      "But look, two months ago you’d have been laughed out of town even for proposing the question ‘Are Man United good now?’ so the progress is real and undeniable. And it’s very, very funny that they are above Liverpool in the league table now.",
      "",
      "We are in full hands-up mode here, because we thought they would be absolutely buggered without Thomas Frank and a great many of their best players and having entrusted their continued Premier League security to a rookie manager.",
      "Instead, turns out they are absolutely fine, and that promoting the set-piece coach was a genius idea because, if anything, they’ve just got even better at scoring from set-pieces. Can already count Aston Villa, Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle among their victims this season since defeat at Nottingham Forest on the opening weekend of the season, already a strong contender for most deceptive result of the season.",

      "For six games it really was bleak, the disappointment at how last season ended bleeding into a moribund start to this campaign, one in which five of their first six games ended either 0-0, 1-1 or a 1-0 defeat with the one exception a 3-0 paddling from Crystal Palace.",
      "It really did look and feel like something coming to an end. A bold and often brilliant attempt to disrupt the established Premier League elite under the astute leadership of Unai Emery, a manager who really quite recently found a club battling against relegation back to the Championship.",
      "Didn’t feel at all right that it might happen with nothing tangible to show for it, Villa having bollocksed some pretty presentable trophy opportunities, including but not limited to last season’s FA Cup and the Europa Conference League the year before – a competition not even West Ham had managed to West Ham up.",
      "But now, 10 games and eight wins later? All is once again well and the positive vibes are there for all to see. They’ve started beating decent teams in compelling fashion, even if the two defeats during that run are curiosities – against mid-crisis Liverpool in the Premier League and at Go Ahead Eagles in the Europa League.",
      "That Europa League defeat feels particularly incongruous, sitting as it does between deserved wins over Spurs and Man City in the league but also in stark contrast to what we think is in fact responsible for turning Villa’s season around.",
      "European football can be a curious beast. It can be both benefit and burden, often in the same season and occasionally even at the exact same time.",
      "Villa and Newcastle are not remotely the same club, but they are essentially trying to achieve the same thing: muscle in on the big boys’ turf. And we really don’t think it’s entirely a coincidence that they keep alternating Champions League status at the expense of both each other and whichever Big Six clubs happen to be in the process of fumbling about at that particular time.",
      "Newcastle are doing perfectly well in the Champions League, but its toll is already visible on their doom-spiralling league form. And ‘success’ in a competition you have no realistic chance of actually winning isn’t really worth it when your domestic form suffers.",
      "Villa, by contrast, are in the very winnable indeed Europa League which changes everything. There is not the same stress or toll on the same group of players. There is greater scope for personnel changes and the greater possibility that success in one competition boosts the other rather than the reverse.",
      "We’re not saying Villa are better off out of the Champions League, because who knows how different their summer might have looked had they made it. There’s also the financial implications of which tournament you’re in, which for Villa – who continue to fly close to the PSR wind – are more significant than their rivals.",
      "But missing out on the Champions League isn’t all bad. Spurs fans were widely mocked for ‘celebrating’ their Arsenal-scuppering defeat to Man City that may have cost them a Champions League place. A year later, they won the Europa League.",
      "There really is absolutely no reason Villa can’t go and do the same this season, and even if they don’t the Europa League has already had a positive kick-starting effect on their season. That divide between the bad and good parts of their season to date sits conveniently but not coincidentally on the moment their Europa League campaign began.",
      "And there really is every chance for things to get better yet, with Leeds, Young Boys, Wolves and Brighton to come in the first couple of weeks after the international break, before what does admittedly look like an absolute tw*t of a December where they have to play Man United, Chelsea and for some reason Arsenal twice.",
      "",
      "Something is happening. They’re still going to need a bit of help from Arsenal, but something is happening. They are the last club Arsenal would want to see looming over their shoulder, and Arsenal the club City would feel most confident pursuing.",
      "For both clubs, there is just so much muscle memory at play.",
      "The likelihood remains that City do come up short and that will mean a previously unthinkable two consecutive seasons without the title for Pep Guardiola. But even if that does happen, he appears reinvigorated and engaged again with the challenge of turning a new-look squad playing a slightly different version of Pepball into challengers once more.",
      "For so much of last season, Guardiola just clearly wasn’t enjoying himself or the challenge as City’s season collapsed in on itself around this time last year.",
      "At that point, there appeared a very good chance he wouldn’t even still be in charge of City this season, never mind back challenging at the very sharpest end of the title race.",
      "And history does tell us that if Pep’s City are in the title race at all, they generally come out on top.",
      "It still seems pretty clear that Arsenal are the best team in the country, but City and Pep know better than most that title races involve more than just that.",
      "",
      "You couldn’t blame them if some old memories are resurfacing, some wounds reopening. Their first dropped points – and first conceded goals – in ages happening the same weekend Man City produce a statement mauling of Liverpool to cut the lead back to four points.",
      "It’s understandable, when you’ve finished second for three seasons in a row, that nagging doubts are par for the course.",
      "But really, there is no need to be alarmed. A 2-2 draw at Sunderland is a far better result than might have been expected to be the case. Plenty of good teams will go there and lose before the season is out.",
      "And Arsenal are still clearly the team to beat in the title race this time. They have comfortably the best defence, an elite midfield and an attacking method that boils p*ss yet gets the job done with confirmed regularity.",
      "They have the deepest squad by far among the contenders as well as the most sustainable, repeatable method. For all the moral panic about set-piece goals, the only valid criticism is about becoming too predictable and reliant. But Arsenal are no more reliant on set-piece goals than City are on Erling Haaland ones.",
      "And that draw at Sunderland draw was moments away from being to our mind the perfect result. Had they managed to win 2-1, having gone behind, with open-play goals, away against a really decent team, it would have answered so many questions – fair and unfair – while also shutting down the noise around clean sheets and all-time defensive records before they became a distraction from the main business at hand.",
      "Right now it really does feel like the season where Arsenal end that wait for a trophy, and that really should involve winning (at least) one of the big two given the way they’ve started both at home and in Europe.",

They’ve just given Arsenal as good a game as anyone this season, with the first half at the Stadium of Light perhaps the best anyone, anywhere has yet played against the champions-elect.",
      "And they’re doing it time and again. There’s no longer any mystery to them being as high up the table as they are; they’re just playing that well.",
      "They’ve already pretty much taken relegation off the table, and while it’s fun to compare them to previous promoted sides they’ve already surpassed, it’s also now largely pointless. To consider this Sunderland team in terms of what promoted teams can or should achieve in their first season. How Sunderland compare to Southampton is simply no longer relevant.",

      "The name of Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly coming up at Chelsea again as an insider has confirmed talks took place for his transfer in the summer.",
      "Manchester United have five central midfielders to choose from, and in the two midfield roles in their 3-4-2-1 system, they generally use the same two men. Bruno Fernandes has played the most of any of those options, and Casemiro the second most.",
      "Mainoo has played the fewest minutes of any of the midfield options at United, with 228, and reports suggest he’ll want to leave in January, having tried to exit in the summer, when he was told he was staying.",
      "There are multiple options on his tail, and Chelsea are one of the most intriguing.",
      "Blues insider Simon Phillips has revealed that Mainoo’s name is cropping up at Stamford Bridge, after they held talks with his agent in the summer.",
      "He suggests that a midfield signing is on the agenda for Enzo Maresca’s side. The likes of Cole Palmer, Dario Essugo, Enzo Fernandez and Romeo Lavia have all suffered with injury problems this season.",
      "As a result, adding more depth to the midfield will be useful as Chelsea look to maintain third spot in the Premier League.",
      "While Lavia’s injury could see him return within a month, the Blues aren’t entirely certain on that, reports staying he’ll be out for ‘at least’ that period.",
      "If they need cover in the midfield, then a hungry Mainoo who will surely feel hard done by at United and wants to push his case for inclusion in England’s World Cup squad could be a great option.",
      "Whether United would allow Mainoo to join Chelsea remains to be seen. The pair are competing in the same area at the moment, with the third-placed Blues only two points ahead of seventh-placed United.",
      "Though Mainoo isn’t getting much game time at Old Trafford at the moment, the Red Devils won’t want to strengthen a direct competitor, and after not allowing the midfielder to leave in the summer, it feels unlikely he’ll be given the nod to exit now.",
      "Mainoo will be desperate for something to change, though, having only started one game all season – against Grimsby in the League Cup – while 45 minutes is the most he’s played in a single Premier League game this term.",
      "Our friends at TEAMtalk have suggested an exit is on the cards, but it’ll be a loan to Napoli – a side who can’t harm United.",
      "Sources close to Kobbie Mainoo reveal the England international is increasingly receptive to a January switch to Naples.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has informed INEOS what he thinks ‘must’ be done in this January transfer window.",
      "A Manchester United star with 10 clubs reportedly tracking him will push for an exit in January, with a source saying “make no mistake about it.”",
      "Man Utd are “very unlikely” to allow wantaway duo Joshua Zirkzee or Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in January, according to the club’s ex-chief scout.",

      "Roy Keane failed to hide his derision as Ole Gunnar Solksjaer claimed one Manchester United player was “unplayable” under him at Old Trafford.",
      "Solskjaer oversaw 149 games as United manager between March 2019 and November 2021 before being replaced by Erik ten Hag, and is now out of a job having been sacked by Besiktas after just 29 games in charge of the Turkish giants.",
      "111 of Anthony Martial’s 317 United appearances came under Solskjaer at Old Trafford before he left for AEK Athens in the summer of 2024.",
      "And the ex-Man Utd boss was asked about the striker – who now plays for Monterrey – on The Overlap, with his response promoting a predictable reaction from Keane, who was particularly critical of Martial’s performances for the Red Devils.",
      "Speaking on Stick to Football, Solskjaer said: “So talented, so talented. On his day, he was unplayable.",
      "“He had a good season. They played together, him and Marcus [Rashford], when we got second that year [in 2019/20].",
      "“Everyone wanted the inside left position. Him, Marcus, Paul Pogba.”",
      "As Solskjaer described Martial as “unplayable”, Keane leant back in his chair and gazing at the ceiling.",
      "“On his day,” Keane said. “That’s not a good thing, what Ole just said. On his day. That means you don’t get too many of them.",
      "“It’s just opinions Ole, no problem.”",
      "In December 2023, Keane suggested Martial may as well “go down the leagues” as he didn’t have enough quality for the Premier League.",
      "“He’s touching balls off and gives the ball away cheaply. You may as well go down the leagues.”",
      "A few months earlier, after United lost 2-0 to Tottenham, Keane suggested that two Red Devils players from the 1980s would have had a similar impact to Martial off the bench.",
      "He said: “They’re bringing on players like Martial. They’re bringing on these players… you might as well as bring on Frank Stapleton and Norman Whiteside",
      "“Martial’s not going to get you out of trouble.”",
      "Roy Keane thinks Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford should be starting for England ahead of Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is “shocked” Scott McTominay was sold by Man Utd amid the Red Devils’ ‘concrete interest’ in re-signing the midfielder from Napoli.",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been criticised for failing to bring Alexander Isak off the bench despite needing goals in their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City.",
      "Gary Neville hit out at one Liverpool star for “killing” his teammate in a “really strange” moment during the 3-0 loss against Manchester City.",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has argued that Liverpool have no chance of winning the Premier League title after their 3-0 loss against Man City.",
      "Roy Keane claims Ruben Amorim’s “love” of one Man Utd star is a “head-scratcher”. “At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor.”"

      "A former Manchester United scout has told the club there is only one man in their academy who is capable of playing in the club’s first team at the moment.",

      "Notable examples are the likes of Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and of late, Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "But at the moment, it’s not felt that there are many in United’s academy set-up who are ready to make the jump.",
      "Tyler Fredricson and Mainoo are the only academy products to feature for the Red Devils this term and they’ve combined for just 273 minutes on the field.",
      "Former United scout Piotr Sadowski has explained there’s only one academy product at the club who’s ready for the step up.",
      "He said: “Now, United are wary of bringing in youngsters. [Ruben] Amorim was supposed to be the one to do this, but the results haven’t been right, so he prefers to buy ready-made players.",
      "“Whether he has anyone to choose from in the backroom is another matter. In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell.”",
      "Amass, 18, has played seven times for United’s senior side, and is currently out on loan at Championship club Sheffield Wednesday – his parent club are paying his full wages to give him opportunities – where the left-back has scored once in 11 games.",
      "While Wednesday are struggling towards the bottom of the table, Amass has been a shining light.",
      "There have been suggestions of a recall in January, but the Sheffield Star‘s Alex Miller has reported discussions over the left-back’s future are ongoing after a discourse began at the weekend.",
      "Rob Staton has since revealed Amass will not be recalled, with the expectation being that he stays for the rest of the season.",
      "Speaking to the Star, the left-back is clear on what he needs to do during his loan spell.",
      "He said: “It’s about going back as a better player.",
      "“At the moment I haven’t really thought too much about it even though it is coming. I just want to play in the games and a lot of stuff has happened higher. We’re waiting for things to get straightened out and we’ll sort it out closer to the time. But at the moment I’m just enjoying playing here.”"

      "After spending time in Real’s academy, Carreras was signed to United’s. There, the Spaniard proved himself a great attacking asset, with four goals and 10 assists in the under-23s.",
      "He had a successful loan spells at Preston, and then moved to Granada for another loan, before United lost faith and sold him to Benfica for around £5million.",
      "United had a buyback clause and after Carreras scored four goals and assisted five last term, many felt they should use it, but they opted against and the full-back joined Real Madrid.",
      "There, he has started 15 games and looks a tremendous asset, scoring a long-range effort in the 4-0 victory over Valencia of late.",
      "Former United scout Sadowski has hit out at the club for showing little faith in Carreras despite his progress with them.",
      "“Initially, his career was going well. He was loaned to Preston, where he received good reviews, and then United abandoned him, selling him to Benfica for a reduced fee,” he said.",
      "“He’s a world-class player. There’s a very good chance he’ll become the best, or one of the best, left-backs in the world.",
      "“He recently scored a fantastic goal against Valencia in La Liga. It was a huge mistake for United to let him go. Something’s missing here, and I think that’s United’s lack of courage to invest in young players.”",
      "That Carreras has started every game bar one for Real this season suggests United should have activated their buyback to land him before they were able.",
      "The Spaniard has played some of his football as a wing-back, so it is not as if he would not have been a good fit for Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "It will be the latest in a string of poor transfer decisions from United if Carreras does become one of the best in the world, and currently it seems he’s well on his way, having seamlessly slotted into the Real side.",
      "Man Utd have been told by a former club scout that they “gave up” on Real Madrid star Alvaro Carreras too soon with the Patrick Dorgu signing “a dud”.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",

      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",

      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",

      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",

      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Casemiro is in the final year of his Manchester United contract, 33 years old and it's fair to admit he's also past his pomp, but he is a crucial cog in Ruben Amorim's midfield.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, five have come when Casemiro was on the pitch. The other 15 goals they've shipped have come without him. That pattern was clear in United's 2-2 draw at Spurs.",
      "Casemiro was taken off with less than 20 minutes to go and United leading through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header. Spurs then scored twice late on when he left the field.",
      "Casemiro has an undeniable impact on United but Amorim's over-reliance on the Brazil international is a further reflection of the club's need to find an appropriate heir in midfield. United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",
      "However, Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser extended Spurs' winless home run in the competition to five.",

      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",
      "Had another clean sheet been secured, this wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. But, ultimately, this would be costly.",
      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",
      "Admittedly, in the second half, the Black Cats were at the mercy of Arsenal, who looked likely to score with almost every attack. In the first, though, it was a very different tale.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side put in a commanding first 45 minutes. And it wasn't by playing the most beautiful football. It was by forcing their opponents to play the game exactly how they wanted it to be played.",
      "The resolute nature of Sunderland's rearguard performance began to irritate the Gunners, and by the time they conceded they were just playing into the hands of the hosts. Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",
      "When people say there are no easy games in the Premier League, Sunderland are the evidence they will continue to point towards.Callum Bishop",
      "Booed off at half-time, given a standing ovation at the final whistle. There was a big mood-shift at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea eventually broken down and then tore apart Wolves.",

      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",

      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",

      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role.

      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "Ruben Amorim was downbeat after Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Man Utd at Spurs and extended their unbeaten run in the league to five games, their longest under him, after throwing away another lead and seeing Benjamin Sesko forced off with a knee injury",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his team \"have a lot of problems\" as he delivered a reality check after the 2-2 draw at Tottenham.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a point for United to extend their unbeaten league run to five games, their longest under the Portuguese, but Amorim was frustrated to see his side repeat the mistakes of last Saturday's draw at Nottingham Forest.",
      "United led for nearly an hour through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header, but late goals from Spurs substitute Mathys Tel and Richarlison, seven minutes apart, turned the game before De Ligt rescued a draw with his side a player down after Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "Amorim said United, who would have gone second had they held on to win, struggled to cope when he took Casemiro and Harry Maguire off with less than 20 minutes to go as he struck a downbeat tone ahead of the international break.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United after his second spell came to a sour end following a bombshell interview in 2022; the Al Nassr forward says, despite an upturn in form at Old Trafford the Premier League club is not on the right path and needs to change",
      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""
