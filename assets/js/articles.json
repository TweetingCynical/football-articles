      "Brentford striker Ivan Toney has been linked with a summer move away from West London but the England international's reported wage demands could pose a challenge",
      "Ivan Toney is after a pay packet which would see him earn more than Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, it has been claimed.",
      "England and Brentford striker Toney is expected to leave his club over the summer, with the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea previously linked with a swoop in addition to United. The 28-year-old has four goals in 13 club outings since returning from a betting ban, after scoring 20 in the Premier League last season.",
      "The former Newcastle man also scored his first senior England goal in March, putting away a penalty in the 2-2 draw with Belgium. While Brentford have pulled clear of relegation danger, he is still tipped to leave the Bees in the summer.",
      "United were keen to add a striker in January but financial restrictions stood in their way. While Toney may fit the bill for manager Erik ten Hag, his reported demands could upset high earner Fernandes.",
      "According to The Sun, Toney is after £250,000 per week, the equivalent of £13m per year. That's said to be £10,000 per week more than Fernandes, with the demands also potentially standing in the way of a new Brentford deal for Toney.",
      "Fernandes isn't United's highest earner, despite wearing the armband. That honour is understood to belong to Casemiro, with Raphael Varane, Marcus Rashford and out-on-loan Jadon Sancho all on £300,000 or more per week. Mason Mount and Anthony Martial are reported to be on £250,000 per week, though the latter is set to depart in the summer.",
      "Varane could also be on the move, with no agreement reached on a new contract at the time of writing. If both French internationals depart, it would significantly lower United's weekly wage bill.",
      "Toney scored four goals in his first five league appearances of the season, including a free-kick against Nottingham Forest in his first game back. Two months have passed since the last of those goals, though, and he angered some Bees fans with comments on the eve of their match against Burnley in March.",
      "When asked about his dream end to the season, he said: \"I'm in the mix for the Euros and then we win the Euros. Let things fall into the place. If Brentford were to sell me, they'd make their money, I move to Madrid and it's all good\".",
      "Thomas Frank's team lost to Burnley that weekend, but have gone unbeaten in four games since to ease their relegation worries. The first of those games came against Manchester United, with Kristoffer Ajer scoring a stoppage-time equaliser, while Toney remained on the bench for Saturday's 2-0 victory over Sheffield United.",
      "Three points away at Luton in their next game would lift the Bees 10 points clear of the drop zone and all but assure another season of Premier League football. United, meanwhile, have work to do to even qualify for the Europa League after losing ground on the top four in recent weeks.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe will run the London Marathon for an eighth time on Sunday - but the Manchester United co-owner needs to shave a chunk off his personal best if he is to make FA Cup semi-final kick-off at Wembley.",
      "The 71-year-old ran a solid 4:32 last year despite having a niggling hamstring. And Ratcliffe will have to complete the 26.2 mile challenge much quicker if he is to reach Wembley before Erik ten Hag’s side begin their clash with Coventry.",
      "The marathon begins at 10am - the INEOS chief is likely to set off several minutes later, behind the speedier runners - and the FA Cup semi has been moved to 3:30pm on police advice.",
      "That will leave Ratcliffe with less than an hour to recover from his exertions to reach his seat in the Wembley directors’ box. And a host of road closures should make the 10-mile journey from the Mall even more difficult than normal.",
      "London Marathon race director Hugh Brasher has hailed Ratcliffe as an “incredibly positive” influence on athletics. INEOS funded former world record holder Eliud Kipchoge’s successful attempt at breaking two hours in 2019 and Ratcliffe was also a force behind establishing the Daily Mile Foundation, which promotes physical activities in primary schools.",
      "However Brasher is tight-lipped on what additional measures will be taken to protect Britain’s second richest man. “As with other high-profile people that we have running, we do not detail the security that is in place,” Brasher said. “Otherwise people would get around it. We have a number of people running the event that we help with security. But we never detail what that is.”",
      "And asked whether he has any advice for Ratcliffe, who has previously completed an Ironman and estimates to have run more than 40 marathons, Brasher added: “I think Jim probably doesn’t need a huge amount of advice from me on running the London Marathon. He’s done seven London Marathons. That’s three more than I’ve done.",
      "“What he has been doing for sport in terms of Eliud Kipchoge and the Ineos 1:59. We were the organisational team behind that. We worked with the Vienna marathon team. Then he has long-term views for Manchester United. The fact he is one-third owner of Mercedes Motorsports.",
      "“Sport is an incredible part of his DNA. He’s also helped set up the Daily Mile Foundation, which does a huge amount to inspire school kids to get active and to encourage school kids to walk or run.",
      "“What he has been doing for sport overall is incredibly positive. But he definitely doesn’t need my advice on timings or how well to run.”",

      "That is the view of former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who \"would like to see him\" in the Premier League and is confident Amorim would be successful at Anfield.",

There was no interview, much less an agreement, the only thing we all want here is to be champions for Sporting, nothing will change.",
      "\"I'm a Sporting coach, there was no interview or agreement with any club, I'm just focused as always on defending my club.

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic believes Red Devils target Joao Neves ought to stay at Benfica rather than make a \"too early\" move to Old Trafford or anywhere else.",
      "Matic, who spent five years with United after joining under Jose Mourinho in 2017, was on Benfica's books for three years in between two spells at Chelsea. He was 25 when he left the Lisbon club, and won the Premier League in his first full season back at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Neves, 19, has established himself in the Benfica first team after a breakout season last term. A number of clubs from Europe's top leagues have been linked, with United keeping a close eye on the teenager.",
      "Back in January, Benfica put out a statement denying they had held talks with the Premier League club over a potential transfer. Roger Schmidt's team are on track for a second-place Primeira Liga finish after retaining the youngster's services, and Matic has suggested Neves would be well placed staying put for the time being.",
      "“He’s fantastic. At just 19, he’s a fantastic player,\" Matic told O Jogo (via Sport Witness). \"He’s the future of Benfica. Of course, he’s interested some Premier League clubs too. I really like this type of player, who is young but plays with a lot of maturity.",
      "“I think it’s too early for him to take that step of leaving. If I were him, he’d stay at Benfica for a few more years to play in the Champions League and to mature more.",

      "Matic's comments are a little at odds with those of Bruno Fernandes. The United captain, an international colleague of Neves with Portugal, suggested the teenager is ready for the next step in his club career.",
      "Neves earned his first senior Portugal caps in 2023, coming off the bench for Roberto Martinez's team in their last three Euro 2024 qualifiers. He also got minutes in both friendlies in March, a victory over Sweden and a defeat to Slovenia.",
      "\"\"I don't know if United rumours are true, but I know he is ready for that big jump,\" Fernandes said in March. \"He is an excellent player, he's with the national team… that's also why the big clubs are after him.\"",

      "The World Cup winner, 36, was considered to be one of Europe's elite players when he moved to Old Trafford from Real Madrid in a then-British record transfer deal back in 2014. The winger failed to settle in Manchester, though, and left the following year after burglars attempted to raid his family home.",
      "Although Di Maria's time at United was short, he left a lasting impression on a young Pereira. Now at Fulham, the 28-year-old recalls that Di Maria made an instant impact in training and that everyone was convinced he would help United would win the league.",
      "Speaking on Vibe with Five, Pereira said: “Di Maria when he arrived from the first session he did. He was unbelievable. He arrived from the Champions League final being the best player. He did the first session and everyone said – seriously, everyone said – we are going to win the league. This guy is amazing.”",
      "While there were mitigating factors behind his decision to leave Manchester after just one season, Pereira went on theorise that the weight of playing for a club like United while wearing the No.7 shirt got to Di Maria.",
      "He continued: “I didn’t know what happened, it was crazy. He didn’t adapt, and then the thing happened with his family, I think this has a big thing to do. [I saw] a big player like this cannot play at United, the pressure is there. It’s difficult to play for United and wear the seven, it’s difficult.”",
      "Di Maria made just 32 appearances for Manchester United before making the move to Paris Saint-Germain, where he stayed for seven years. He joined one of his former clubs, Benfica, in the summer.",
      "Di Maria has spoken extensively on his time in Manchester and the circumstances surrounding his departure. And while he's previously targeted former manager Louis van Gaal, he admits the biggest reason he and his wife left England was simply because they could not settle.",
      "He told Le Parisien: “Honestly, we were not happy. In the beginning, we were a little happy but then things got complicated. Life in England was difficult and it isn't easy for a South American. Some people adapt, but for others, it is harder.",
      "“I didn't get on very well with the coach [either]. So I believe the decision to join Paris was the best solution.”",

      "Manchester United’s season has certainly not gone to plan and new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe now has some major decision to make when it comes to his squad and coaching staff",
      "Manchester United’s 2023/24 season has certainly not gone to plan so far.",
      "The Red Devils languish in seventh in the Premier League, with their hopes of a Champions League berth come the end of the season fading fast. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a huge task on his hands to turn the club into bonafide title challengers.",
      "The INEOS owner has already hinted at changes on the pitch and in the dressing room this summer. Before that, Man United also have an FA Cup semi-final to navigate.",
      "The Red Devils take on Championship side Coventry City at Wembley this weekend. Take a look at all the headlines coming out of Old Trafford over the past 24 hours:",
      "Bologna chief Claudio Fenucci has issued a strong hands-off warning to any clubs interested in swooping for manager Thiago Motta. The Italian was reportedly among Ratcliffe’s targets should he sack Erik ten Hag.",
      "Fenucci said: “Thiago is working like he had a long-term contract with us. It’s not a problem that he hasn’t yet confirmed his journey with us for the coming years. What bothers me a little is the continuous rumours and the noise around our players. I am not okay with it.",
      "“We are a strong club, one of the most solid in Serie A and we don’t want to change this group in the future. It’s very annoying to see many of our players linked with other clubs, it’s not a nice feeling. However, I am sure this has a limited effect on them as they are all focused on our target and happy to be at Bologna.",
      "“Our club is solid financially thanks to our owner [Joey Saputo], and we have long-term plans for the club’s growth, sporting results, and organisation. We have a long-term vision and financial solidity to continue on this journey.”",
      "On the topic of the Red Devils’ boss, Gary Neville has claimed his future could be decided by how the club do in the FA Cup. Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: \"I don’t think there is anything left to say about some of the league performances that we are witnessing and some of the things that we are watching.",
      "“The tweets, the ‘likes’ and the body language… all that stuff, we have said it so many times before. There is no point going over that again.",
      "“What we can say is that Ten Hag’s future is largely dependent on the FA Cup, because the performance levels in the league have gone. They are like this and they are not going to change now.”",
      "Former Chelsea star Glen Johnson has urged the Blues to move for Man Utd defender Raphael Varane this summer. The ex-Real Madrid centre-back is out of contract this summer.",
      "Speaking to Betfred, Johnson said: \"Good players like that don’t come around often and they certainly come around less often on a free transfer. I know he’s not the Varane he was three or four years ago but he’s still a bloody good player.",
      "\"Yes, he’s had his injury problems but that’s what outweighs the transfer fee – if you’re buying him on a free and he’s only playing 40% of the games, then that’s still a good deal to do,\" he added.",

      "The Austrian midfielder recorded two assists in a back and forth quarter-final clash against Atletico Madrid before bagging the all-important winning goal. Sabitzer first unleashed Chelsea loanee Ian Maatsen in the opening half before delivering the cross for Niclas Fullkrug's header that put the German side back on level terms over the two legs.",
      "With 74 minutes on the clock, Sabitzer took a touch to nudge the ball into the box before hitting a left-footed strike past Jan Oblak. Jubilant celebrations unfolded as Sabitzer stormed to the corner of the pitch and over the advertising boards to be joined by teammates from on and off the field.",
      "The 30-year-old's effort ensured a 5-4 scoreline on aggregate and a 4-2 win on the night at the Westfalenstadion. The German side will go on to face Paris Saint Germain in the semi-finals after Barcelona suffered a meltdown in their quarters clash.",
      "Dortmund signed Sabitzer from Bayern Munich for a fee in the region of £16million and has been a regular under Edin Terzic, adding six goals in his 34 appearances this term. Certainly his match-winning performance this evening may have left some at Old Trafford wondering what they missed out on.",
      "Sabitzer spent the latter half of last season helping United secure a Carabao Cup trophy and a place in the Champions League. The Dortmund star has progressed far further than the Red Devils managed after they crashed out bottom of their group before Christmas.",
      "It was in Europe for United too where the midfielder probably delivered his most memorable effort. Sabitzer scored two goals in the first leg of the Red Devil's Europa League clash against Sevilla, but could not help his side progress on that occasion.",
      "\"He was everywhere in the big moments. Everything he touched today, Sabitzer, turned to gold. To be fair you need players to step up in the big moments, Sabitzer was the guy that stepped up and changed the game.\"",

      "Ratcliffe assembled the task force last month to explore the club's options, with the new United co-owner keen to create a 'Wembley of the North'. Mirror Football reported that Ratcliffe had considered revamping Old Trafford, but ultimately decided it would be best to demolish the stadium and rebuild it instead.",
      "The Glazers are understood to have given the project their approval and the task force held their inaugural meeting on Monday to discuss the plans. World Athletics President Lord Sebastian Coe is chairing the task force, which also includes Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and former United captain Gary Neville.",
      "And Lord Coe has now offered an update on the meeting, writing on social media: \"Yesterday, I chaired the first meeting of the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force to kick off a conversation about how development of a world-class football stadium for the north of England can deliver social and economic benefits for the region.",
      "\"At the London 2012 Olympics, I saw first-hand how sport can be a powerful driver of urban regeneration and I am excited to be part of this project. This meeting marked the start of a multi-stakeholder process to explore options for the stadium and surrounding area.",
      "\"We are at the start of this journey, and it is too soon to know where it will lead. But we will consult closely with fans and local residents along the way, and keep everyone informed of progress.\"",
      "Speaking last month, Ratcliffe claimed that building a new stadium is a \"once-in-a-century opportunity\" for the club. He said: \"This can be a major regeneration project for an area of Greater Manchester which has played such a key role in British industrial history, but which today requires new investment to thrive again.",
      "\"The north-west of England has a greater concentration of major football clubs than anywhere else in the world, yet we don't have a stadium on the scale of Wembley, the Nou Camp or the Bernabeu. We will not be able to change that on our own, which is why this task force is so important to help us seize this once-in-a-century opportunity.\"",
      "Neville, meanwhile, added: \"Old Trafford has evolved throughout its history and it's clear we are at a point where it has to change again to ensure that Manchester United has a world-class stadium befitting the world’s greatest club.",
      "\"While I want the best for Manchester United, I also want the same for the surrounding community. Old Trafford should be a stadium that the whole of Greater Manchester can take pride in, and be a catalyst for sustainable, cohesive growth in an area of the city that has been neglected for too long.\"",

      "\"When I went to the training ground, they didn't even say you are going to meet Fergie or anyone. I remember walking in Carrington, and I was like 'I want to come'. It was an amazing complex.",
      "\"Then I was told, 'someone wants to meet you' and it was Fergie. I just remember him standing in front and I could not believe it. My dad did not know what to do. First, he said something and I did not understand it because his English is different.",
      "\"And then after that, he said, 'There is always room for a Brazilian on my team'. That stuck with me, and I did not even want to go home I just wanted to stay there straight away.\"",

      "\"It's been a long journey. Talent-wise and skills always came easy for me. To be hard working I always remember Warren Joyce in the reserves getting on my case. I had to run and tackle and smash people and I was like, 'What is this',\" he added.",

      "Gallas, who played for Arsenal and Tottenham after leaving Stamford Bridge in 2006, called on his former club to test United's resolve over high earners Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford. Now, Johnson also wants the London side to add experience, identifying Raphael Varane as a transfer option.",
      "United opted against triggering an extension in Varane's contract midway through the current season. The centre-back, who joined from Real Madrid in 2024, could leave Old Trafford as a free agent in the summer.",
      "The 30-year-old, who is currently sidelined through injury, has been linked with a summer return to Madrid. Johnson, however, wants Chelsea to pounce after a challenging season at the back.",
      "\"Good players like that don’t come around often and they certainly come around less often on a free transfer,\" Johnson told Betfred. \"I know he’s not the Varane he was three or four years ago but he’s still a bloody good player.",
      "\"Yes, he’s had his injury problems but that’s what outweighs the transfer fee – if you’re buying him on a free and he’s only playing 40% of the games, then that’s still a good deal to do,\" he added. Varane has started just 16 league games this season amid various setbacks, but Johnson argued the French international's experience could still prove valuable.",

      "Unlike Varane, Fernandes and Rashford wouldn't come cheap. Despite Chelsea potentially needing to lower their spending in the summer, though, Gallas pointed to the United pair as good fits.",
      "“Both Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes could be good options for Chelsea,\" the Frenchman told Gambling Zone. \"Both are quality players. Bruno could definitely be the kind of midfielder who has the quality to play in the number ten role where Chelsea lack strength.",
      "“Chelsea are a team of young players and Bruno Fernandes has the leadership qualities to get through certain periods. He’d be a good signing if the rumours are true.”",
      "Chelsea and United are both battling it out for a Europa League spot, with Mauricio Pochettino's team keeping their hopes alive by beating Everton on Monday night. Victory for the Blues in their game in hand would see them leapfrog seventh-placed United on goal difference, while drawing level on points with sixth-placed Newcastle.",
      "Pochettino has indicated a need to add experience to his young squad over the summer after dropped points all but ended any hopes of Champions League qualification. The Blues conceded late goals in 2-2 draws with strugglers Burnley and Sheffield United when victories could have put them in better shape for the run-in.",
      "\"We need to bring more young players, we need to bring in some experienced players. But that is all about talking,\" Pochettino said ahead of the Everton game. \"It's about agreeing with the club, analysing and designing the strategy for the next season and to go and fight for big things. That is really important.\"",

      "Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher has questioned whether Everton midfielder Amadou Onana is suitable for a move to one of the Premier League's elite amid links to Arsenal and Manchester United",
      "Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal and Manchester United would be making a mistake if they were to pursue Everton midfielder Amadou Onana in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Toffees midfielder, 22, has been linked with several of the Premier League's elite in recent months and was the subject of interest from the Gunners in January. It's been widely reported that the Belgium international is valued at around £50million.",
      "Everton's financial issues have been well documented and selling a player of high value, such as Onana, would go a long way to help easing further concerns in the short-term.",
      "While it remains to be seen if any of Onana's high-profile suitors are planning a summer swoop, Carragher stressed that he wouldn't be a good signing for top clubs after Everton's humiliating 6-0 loss against Chelsea on Monday night.",
      "The former Liverpool defender told Sky Sports: “I must say this, Onana is a player who Everton may have to sell with the situation that they find themselves in financially.",
      "“He came in with a huge reputation. Frank Lampard brought him in, he looks the part, did really well I think for Belgium at Wembley and there was talk of him going to other big clubs. I don’t see it. I haven’t since he’s been there.",
      "“I don’t know what he is. Is he a holding midfield player? Does he get forward? Does he get involved? The only thing I have seen him do is try to lift the crowd, that is all I ever see him do when he plays for Everton.”",
      "Onana, who was hauled off at half-time in Monday night's match by manager Sean Dyche, rebuffed interest from Arsenal in the winter transfer window, according to his sister and agent, Melissa.",
      "Speaking back in February, via Sport Witness, she said: “We could have left this winter, but we once again sat down and asked the question whether it’s the right time, if the player is ready. My job is to put opportunities on the table.",
      "“In the end, he’s the one who makes the choice because it’s his life and his career. I put the opportunities on the table and he said ‘No, I want to stay at Everton and I want to continue to fight’.”",

      "Manchester United have been linked with Bologna head coach Thiago Motta in recent weeks - but one of the club's director has hit out at recent reports and insisted they want to keep him and their team intact",
      "Bologna director Claudio Fenucci is not happy with rumours linking Thiago Motta with Manchester United - but warned the club are determined not to lose him or their star players in the summer.",
      "The Serie A outfit have enjoyed a strong season with Motta, 41, at the helm and the former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, where it remains to be seen if Erik ten Hag will still be in charge next year.",
      "Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team have refused to be drawn on the Dutchman's future since taking control of football operations at the club. Recent reports had indicated Ten Hag was being included for next season, however, there have also been plenty of top coaches linked with the Dutchman's job, including Motta.",
      "Fenucci admitted on Monday that he is \"bothered\" by such speculation but reinforced that the club plan to keep their prized assets, including Joshua Zirkzee. He told Radio Serie A: “Thiago is working like he had a long-term contract with us. It’s not a problem that he hasn’t yet confirmed his journey with us for the coming years. What bothers me a little is the continuous rumours and the noise around our players. I am not okay with it.",
      "“We are a strong club, one of the most solid in Serie A and we don’t want to change this group in the future. It’s very annoying to see many of our players linked with other clubs, it’s not a nice feeling. However, I am sure this has a limited effect on them as they are all focused on our target and happy to be at Bologna.",
      "“Our club is solid financially thanks to our owner [Joey Saputo], and we have long-term plans for the club’s growth, sporting results, and organisation. We have a long-term vision and financial solidity to continue on this journey.”",
      "It emerged earlier this month that United had identified Motta as a potential target following his impressive work at Bologna, who are currently fourth in Serie A.",
      "While Motta is expected to be in high demand after defying expectations in Italy, Ten Hag has massively underwhelmed after overseeing Manchester United's worst season in decades.",
      "The Manchester Evening News revealed on Monday that several players at the club are even delaying decisions over whether or not to move in the summer as they expect that Ten Hag will be sacked by the club's new hierarchy.",
      "A number of senior players are due to be free agents at the end of the season, including the likes of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans. Several other players are expected to be put for sale ahead of Ineos' first transfer window at the helm.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has discussed how important the FA Cup is for the long-term future of Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag ahead of Sunday's semi-final",
      "Gary Neville has claimed that Erik ten Hag's Manchester United future depends on if the club tastes FA Cup glory.",
      "It has been a dismal campaign for the Red Devils, who will almost certainly miss out on Champions League football next term as they languish in seventh with six Premier League games left to play. There is still hope of ending the campaign with some silverware, given United have reached the FA Cup semi-final and will meet Coventry at Wembley on Sunday.",
      "Given Coventry sit a whole league below United, Ten Hag's side are heavy favourites to progress to the final, where they will meet Manchester City or Chelsea. However, failure to do so could spell disaster for the Red Devils boss, at least according to Neville that is.",
      "\"They have to win next weekend. The season would be completely over if they didn’t,\" the former Old Trafford ace told Sky Sports podcast. United have precious little left to play for outside of the FA Cup, given they are 13 points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa.",
      "Neville added: \"I don’t think there is anything left to say about some of the league performances that we are witnessing and some of the things that we are watching. The tweets, the ‘likes’ and the body language… all that stuff, we have said it so many times before.",
      "\"There is no point going over that again. What we can say is that Ten Hag’s future is largely dependent on the FA Cup, because the performance levels in the league have gone. They are like this and they are not going to change now.",
      "“What we’re seeing from United is what we’re going to get for the rest of the season. The players have almost, in some ways, I think, switched off in the league away from home at times. At home they turn it on because they have to, as there are 75,000 people there who won’t allow them to sort of get away from it.\"",
      "United do not come into the clash with Coventry in ideal form. The Red Devils have managed just two league victories since early February and as a result, the pressure is mounting on the manager.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho sparked headlines in the aftermath of Sunday's 2-2 draw away at Bournemouth. The young Argentine was spotted liking tweets that were critical of his manager for substituting the winger at half-time against the Cherries.",

      "The former midfielder started his career at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson. He went on to make just under 40 appearances for the Red Devils and lifted the Premier League in 2001.",
      "Chadwick has gone on to become a bit of a star on TikTok after hanging up his boots. In a Q and A session with fans, the 43-year-old was asked “Which team-mate had the biggest pipe”.",
      "And Chadwick had a hilarious response. Speaking in a video, he said: “Thank you for your question Matt! Tough one to answer, I assume you mean exhaust pipe, and the majority of the lads drove big powerful cars. So the exhaust pipe on the majority of the cars was a decent size, to be honest with you, so it's a tough one to answer.",
      "“I'm really sorry mate, but I don't think I can clarify that. As I said, they all drove really smart cars that had really big exhaust pipes.",
      "“But thank you for the question Matt, it's a really interesting one, I'll have a think and hopefully get back to you at a later date and let you know!”",
      "He captioned the post: “Thanks for the question Matt, I'll always endeavour to answer such important questions!” While Chadwick was not too convinced about revealing ‘personal’ details about his former teammates, he has previously opened up how he found playing alongside personalities such as Roy Keane.",
      "\"I remember my first training session with the first team,\" Chadwick said to FourFourTwo. \"I was on Roy’s team, and I gave the ball away a couple of times. He told me in no uncertain terms that my performance wasn’t up to standard.",

      "\"But he pulled me to one side and explained that there was a level he expected of all of us, and it was his job to make sure we were at it every day. It didn’t matter if it was me, Ryan Giggs or David Beckham; he said he’d speak to everyone in the same way if standards weren’t right.",
      "\"He was intimidating – terrifying, even – but he was the ultimate captain. He would be so supportive during games. He looked out for us on the pitch. If we gave everything, then he would fight for every last one of us.\"",

      "The Gunners make the trip to the Allianz Arena after last week's 2-2 draw in the first-leg against the German giants in north London. A win for either side on the night would send them through to the semi-final, a stage Arsenal have not reached in the Champions League since 2009.",
      "While Mikel Arteta's side can take plenty of confidence from the first-leg, morale is undeniably low in the red half of north London following Sunday's defeat by Aston Villa. Arsenal missed out on the chance to go one point clear at the top of the table after losing 2-0 at home to Unai Emery's side.",
      "Meanwhile, Bayern enjoyed a 2-0 win of their own over FC Koln, but that was not enough to prevent Bayer Leverkusen from winning the Bundesliga and ending Thomas Tuchel's side's reign of dominance. The Bavarians had won the previous 11 titles.",
      "In turn, the Champions League is now all Bayern have to play for and Ferdinand believes they will be the ones to reach the last four. Whoever does will meet the winners of Manchester City vs Real Madrid, which is finely poised at 3-3 on aggregate ahead of their second-leg at the Etihad.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand explained: \"I think it’s advantage Bayern Munich. Bayern are at home and have all that experience in Europe.",
      "\"Arsenal could win but it’s advantage Bayern for me. Can you imagine if [ex-Tottenham captain] Harry Kane knocks them out of Europe? The biggest game of Arsenal’s season is on Wednesday night. If they lose that game, this team will never have been that low under Mikel Arteta.",
      "\"To have a week like this, where you were in control, to then lose control in the league and then you’re out of the Champions League… I would worry for Arsenal at that point.\"",
      "Arteta was asked how his players are feeling ahead of the trip to Munich after Sunday's defeat. His response was notably optimistic as he claimed: \"After losing any game, frustrated and sad.",
      "\"But as I said, we have a beautiful opportunity, an opportunity that hasn’t happened at this club for 14 years to get to the semi-finals of the Champions League, so it cannot come in a better moment.\"",

While there is no denying United will head into Sunday's first FA Cup meeting with Coventry since 1987 as favourites, confidence is unlikely to be flowing within the camp. Since booking a date with Mark Robins' side, United have failed to win, drawing three and losing one of their last four matches. Saturday's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth, coupled with Aston Villa's 2-0 win Arsenal 24 hours later, has left them 13 points shy of the top four with just six Premier League games left to play. Despite that meaning their Champions League qualification hopes are as good as over, United still need to end the campaign as strongly as possible, not least because they need to ensure they clinch Europa League qualification as the second best European prize on offer. West Ham and Chelsea are hot on their heels and the race for European qualification is getting more and more intense.\"",

      "Man United are expected to sign a midfielder in the summer and Kobbie Mainoo has named his perfect partner.",
      "\"Hmmm, I'd say Scholes, although there might not be a lot of defending happening between the two of us,\" said Kobbie Mainoo when asked to name his perfect midfield partner.",
      "Mainoo was given a choice between Manchester United players from the past and present and picked Scholes for his 'passing, movement, intelligence and the way he could finish'.",
      "The 18-year-old is an articulate young man and smiled when suggesting that, although he'd love to play with Scholes, the pairing would probably be too attack-minded.",
      "Sources close to Mainoo have likened him to a student of the game and he understands the midfield would be left compromised with two No.8s playing together, especially when considering that Bruno Fernandes would be ahead of them in his attacking midfield position.",
      "A midfield of Scholes, Mainoo and Fernandes would be perfect in a FIFA video game, but it wouldn't work in reality because that trio would leave the backline exposed. Fernandes plays in an advanced position, Scholes had an eye for goal and Mainoo's future lies in the No.8 role due to the quality he can provide in attacking scenarios.",
      "Mainoo was far from prolific in the academy - his goals were often scrappy - but he's got the skillset to score frequently and he's already notched a few for the first team.",
      "His goals against Newport County in the FA Cup and Wolves in the Premier League were brilliant, but his strike in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool was a moment of class.",
      "Not only that, Mainoo's ability to unlock defences with pinpoint accuracy is a huge asset and asking him to play deep would be wasting and miss-profiling his talent.",
      "Make no mistake, Mainoo is not a defensive midfielder and while he's played a deeper role on occasions this season, he's certainly not the replacement for Casemiro.",
      "A source recently told the MEN that Mainoo 'loves to play with Casemiro' because the Brazilian's defensive discipline gives him the licence to take up more advanced positions. Mainoo is seen to best effect when playing in a more advanced midfield role and United must sign a Casemiro replacement this summer to help him reach his potential.",
      "Interestingly, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was also recently asked which former United player he'd bring into the team and he named Scholes. \"Paul Scholes I'd bring in. That's the player that is most missing,\" said the British billionaire without hesitation on the Cycling Club podcast.",
      "\"They are not Roy Keane but they have Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, they are more defensive. They don't have a Scholes, an [Andres] Iniesta.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has watched football all his life, he's supported United since he was a boy and is entitled to his opinion, but suggesting Mainoo is more defensive probably shows it's a good job he's employing the best-in-class to make key decisions instead of making them himself.",
      "The 71-year-old loves football, United and, importantly, has the self-awareness to employ some of the leading brains in the industry, which has been refreshing.",
      "United have required a reset and Ratcliffe is overseeing it. He is giving the club the best chance of succeeding with board room appointments and they will dictate transfer policy.",
      "High on the agenda this summer will be addressing Casemiro's future and if a world-class player in that mould can be signed, then Mainoo will continue to blossom. The youngster is a talent worth building the midfield around - but he needs support.",

      "The on-loan Man United winger has reached the Uefa Champions League semi-finals with Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Jadon Sancho's trangressions at Manchester United were minor, all things considered.",
      "His September spat with Erik ten Hag now seems like a distant memory, a small footnote amid a season of mayhem at United. Plenty of water has passed under the bridge since.",
      "A quick precis: the manager believed Sancho hadn't trained well and left him out of a matchday squad; the player disagreed and voiced his discontent in public. The rest, as they say is history.",
      "Yet with Sancho now providing United with a timely reminder of his abilities on loan at Borussia Dortmund, helping them reach the Champions League semi-finals, is it time for a reconsideration of this wholly avoidable situation?",
      "You suspect that as long as Ten Hag is in the manager's chair, Sancho's spell in the wilderness will continue. There is undoubtedly bad blood between the pair – which was why the player was jettisoned in the January window on loan back to his former club, Dortmund. Under the Dutchman, there is no way back.",
      "But with Ten Hag's position coming increasingly under scrutiny, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos Sport undertake a full-scale review of United's footballing operations, there could be light at the end of the tunnel for Sancho – should he want to return.",
      "It shouldn't be fanciful to suggest Sancho deserves a second chance at United regardless of who the manager is. Recent reports claim the player, who is still only 24, is open to the idea of starting again at Old Trafford.",
      "A new manager would surely be malleable to the notion of including Sancho in their squad.",
      "The new era under Ratcliffe is an opportunity for everyone to wipe the slate clean. With key appointments being made at the very top of United's structure, such as Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox and Dan Ashworth, a critical decision on the pitch could be to restore Sancho.",
      "If you disregard his strained relationship with Ten Hag and a couple of (only slightly) underwhelming years at United – Sancho still scored 12 goals in 82 appearances for the club – he is a player who still ticks every box for Ineos. He's not 25 until next March, he's an England international of 23 caps and he's an exciting, front-foot attacking player of immense talent.",
      "Whisper it, but Sancho could also fulfil a position where United may actually be short of options come the start of next season. Marcus Rashford could feasibly be sold and Alejandro Garnacho has played his better football on the right. Sancho, as became clear at United and now again at Dortmunnd, is more effective off the left.",
      "More to the point, the 24-year-old is currently at a stage of the Uefa Champions League – the top tier of European club football – that United haven't reached since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "Getting back to the sharp end of the Champions League should be among Ratcliffe's top priorities. Two quarter-final appearances in 10 years is not the return of a true European powerhouse.",
      "Of course, there is some logic behind backing the manager rather than a player who has broken protocol and there's a sense that sacking another coach might be an unnecessary move that would cause more upheaval.",
      "Yet United's chaotic performances in recent weeks mean Ten Hag is quickly running out of rope. Conceding so many shots and being outplayed by mid-table sides will not augur well with Ineos as they ponder the next piece in the puzzle.",
      "And it's not as if the Sancho conundrum is a case of choosing between a player or manager. For Ratcliffe and company, it should be first to decide whether to back or sack Ten Hag.",
      "If the decision is the latter, bringing Sancho back into the fold should be a no-brainer.",

      "\"At the time, I had interest from a few other clubs in Europe but I was always a fan of United and Ronaldo. I wanted to go to United and when it happened, it was fast. We finished the [Manchester United Premier Cup] and they had already started speaking to my Dad about coming to visit.",

      "Erik ten Hag's second season has undoubtedly been one to forget. While the Dutchman could rightly argue that injuries have done him no favours, United are not the only team to struggle with them this season.",
      "Even if they had been, the performances in the Champions League and Premier League would still have been unacceptable. With Sir Jim Ratcliffe now on the scene, there is an acceptance that United are now at the beginning of a new chapter and Ten Hag's role in that is precarious.",
      "But his future could have been given a helping hand by what is happening 211 miles south of Old Trafford. Mauricio Pochettino is no stranger to the challenges which are facing Ten Hag at present.",
      "At PSG, the Argentine's position was in constant jeopardy before eventually being sacked. Now at Chelsea, Pochettino has faced similar strife in his first full season as like United, the Blues have struggled.",
      "In recent weeks though Chelsea have started to turn the corner slowly but surely. Monday night's humiliation of Everton, penalty dramatics aside, was an example of what Pochettino's trying to build for owner Todd Boehly and the fans.",
      "His belated success at Stamford Bridge acts as an argument to keep Ten Hag for at least another season. While Pochettino has been given the funds in the transfer window, United's boss has not been given such a luxury.",
      "While critics will argue that £72m on Rasmus Hojlund is not peanuts, the funds soon ran out for the 'open heart surgery', as Ralf Rangnick put it, which the first-team squad needed desperately. Having tolerated a shoddy recruitment process under the Glazers, it seems only right that the manager is given an opportunity to see what he can do with the backing of a cooperative boardroom.",

      "Wes Brown believes Erik ten Hag could be \"in trouble\" if Manchester United fail to win the FA Cup but says the Dutchman should be afforded more time in charge.",
      "After a string of disappointing showings this season, the former United defender also called on players to take more responsibility. Saturday's 2-2 draw away at AFC Bournemouth left them in seventh as they face the threat of their worst-ever Premier League finish, following their seventh in 2013/14 under David Moyes.",
      "They sit 13 points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa and 10 off Tottenham Hotspur who are fifth in the Premier League. Ten Hag could still scoop silverware with their FA Cup semi-final against underdogs Coventry City on Saturday.",
      "Brown, who won 13 trophies at Old Trafford, has claimed that United should allow some security and believes he has secured enough credit to lead the club into next season.",
      "\"I don't think that Manchester United are the sort of club that should be changing the manager, they should have a respectful three or four years to get what they want done,\" he told The Zone. \"They have to give him one more season, it's simple. I think the manager has done enough in the first two seasons to secure another season.",
      "\"I like Erik ten Hag. United have had big-name managers in and it's all been the same, so something is not right somewhere. You have to give the manager time because if you want to kick on and injuries have stopped him doing what he's wanted to do this year. Martinez is a big miss, he changed things a little bit for Manchester United, he brings power to the defensive line - just like Varane.",
      "\"This season is a tough watch, it's not brilliant now if you're a Manchester United fan. Last season was positive with a good league finish and two finals and a cup, this is where they want to be.",
      "\"The FA Cup could be massive. Erik had a fantastic start last season, finishing well in the league and getting to two finals - winning one,\" Brown continued. \"United have a great opportunity to get to the FA Cup final, winning it will be a big boost. Manchester United are used to winning trophies so it'd be massive for the manager, it's one he'll want to win or he could be in trouble.\"",
      "Injuries, particularly in defence, have hampered Ten Hag and his side this season. Lisandro Martinez - who enjoyed a sparkling debut season in the Premier League - has endured spells on the sidelines with further problems for Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane and Luke Shaw.",
      "During the difficult campaign, criticism hasn't been far from Ten Hag and his side but Brown believes players need to \"stand up\" if they haven't been performing.",
      "He said: \"Manchester United need to be doing better and a lot of people take it out on the manager, but because I've been a player, I'm a player person and I think the players need to stand up as well. Even if it's not the first 11 performing you have to have the respect about yourself to go and play well.",
      "\"Even if you are a sub, you have to get on and show the manager that you are good enough to be straight in the team. It's just not happening.",
      "\"With what's happened and the injuries that Manchester United have had, the manager needs more time. There may be some different changes among the players in the summer and how Sir Jim controls things in his own way, which will include bringing some other people on the football side to do that. The manager has been fine and did a very good job last season and they've dropped off a bit this season with missing some bigger players at the back.",
      "\"Manchester United need to bring top need players in the summer, players that are bossing their positions and bring characters to the team, demand more from the other players. The players that come in need to gel, at times, this season, they have played as individuals and you can tell the top three are teams that are playing together, scoring together, winning together and losing together.\"",

      "Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, it is no secret that changes are in the offing at Manchester United this summer.",
      "Following confirmation of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority investment in February, the Failsworth-born businessman has wasted little time in stamping his authority at Old Trafford. After immediately addressing urgent off-field issues, attention will soon switch to strengthening the squad ahead of the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "United, as reported by the Manchester Evening News in February, are planning for record sales. It is possible the number of players released or sold could run into double figures.",
      "As well as needing to use the transfer market to offload players, it is also possible United will also make the most of expiring contracts to clear the decks. That will be the case as far as Anthony Martial is concerned.",
      "The Frenchman's deal is up at the end of June and he is not going to be offered fresh terms, meaning his nine-year spell in M16 will draw to a close – leaving Rasmus Hojlund as the club's only out-and-out senior centre-forward. Manager Erik ten Hag has already confirmed that United will have to act on that by bringing in a second striker in as many years.",
      "\"I think it would help [to sign a striker],\" he said. \"As I always had in this plan we constructed that we should have had enough goals. You count on goals from Rashy [Marcus Rashford] – last season he had 30 – you count on goals from Martial.\"",
      "Martial's impending exit, as Ten Hag has highlighted, will leave a void within the squad that requires filling. United recruited Hojlund from Atalanta last summer for £64million and he immediately became their first-choice goal-getter.",
      "At the age of just 21, United signed the Dane with a view to him being the face of their forward line for years to come, meaning they are unlikely to invest an extravagant amount on another striker this summer when only a backup or rotation option is needed. It is why links connecting United with Ivan Toney, Victor Osimhen and even Harry Kane feel somewhat fanciful.",
      "Instead, United could do worse than choosing to explore an avenue they have ventured down in the past and see about rekindling their interest in Benjamin Sesko. The RB Leipzig striker, who was on the books of Red Bull Salzburg at the time, was on United's radar in the 2022 summer transfer window.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News at the time, United weighed up a move for him after former football director John Murtough held talks with his agent to gauge the possibility of a move. United, in the end, did not end up recruiting a striker in Ten Hag's first summer in charge.",
      "After another encouraging campaign at Salzburg in 2022/23, Sesko, 20, made the switch to sister club RB Leipzig in June 2023. He signed a five-year deal and has scored a respectable tally of 13 goals in 37 games so far this season.",
      "Also the subject of reported interest from Newcastle in the past, the Slovenian is widely considered as one of the most promising strikers in European football, such is his ability to break the lines, press well and be a threat in the air. His tally of 42 goals across the past three seasons is also encouraging for a player who does not turn 21 until the end of next month.",
      "According to widespread reports, Sesko has a release clause within his Leipzig contract that becomes active this summer and it is said to be worth £42m. United will not be able to land Toney, Osimhen or Kane for a fee so low. Challenges around FFP and PSR are hampering all Premier League clubs' abilities in the transfer market, and United will be no different this summer with the need to embark on a squad rebuild. Any money they can save in one area will be a boost for elsewhere.",
      "While £42m is still not particularly cheap, it has the potential to be a wise investment, such is Sesko's profile and his age.",
      "\"Benjamin Sesko is among the game's top young talents and has enormous potential to become a top player,\" said Christopher Vivell, Leipzig's technical director. \"He has all the qualities to do that.",
      "\"He's extremely quick, has a great jump on him and is strong in the air. Benjamin is a real goalscorer, who despite his 1.95m (6'4\") is mobile and technically strong. His abilities make him a special player with a special profile.\"",

      "When Erik ten Hag steps off the Manchester United team bus at Wembley on Sunday, he will not require directions from a Wembley official to the dressing room area.",
      "This weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City will mark the Dutchman's fourth visit to the national stadium since taking charge of United two years ago. His first was for last season's Carabao Cup final and his two most recent visits were for last season's FA Cup semi-final and final.",
      "It was underneath the famous arch that Ten Hag guided United to their first trophy since 2017, overseeing a 2-0 win over Newcastle. He dreamed of visiting the Royal Balcony for a second time when facing Manchester City in the second domestic cup final of the season in June.",
      "United, of course, were on the wrong end of a 2-1 scoreline that day, meaning Ten Hag's first season at Old Trafford concluded with one trophy and a top four finish, securing Champions League qualification. While those achievements were not comparable with United's successes of yesteryear, they represented steps in the right direction.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's tussle with Coventry, however, United know they must win to keep their season alive. Their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League for next season are as good as over, they exited the Carabao Cup early on and their participation in Europe was over before children had finished scoffing the contents of their advent calendars.",
      "Winning the FA Cup is the only way United can salvage something from what has been a forgettable campaign. It may also be the only way Ten Hag stands a chance of keeping his job.",
      "While there is no denying United will head into Sunday's first FA Cup meeting with Coventry since 1987 as favourites, confidence is unlikely to be flowing within the camp. Since booking a date with Mark Robins' side, United have failed to win, drawing three and losing one of their last four matches.",
      "Saturday's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth, coupled with Aston Villa's 2-0 win Arsenal 24 hours later, has left them 13 points shy of the top four with just six Premier League games left to play. Despite that meaning their Champions League qualification hopes are as good as over, United still need to end the campaign as strongly as possible, not least because they need to ensure they clinch Europa League qualification as the second best European prize on offer. West Ham and Chelsea are hot on their heels and the race for European qualification is getting more and more intense.",
      "Following Sunday's trip to Wembley, United have back-to-back home league games against Sheffield United and Burnley, who are both almost certain to be relegated in the coming weeks. Winning just three away league games between them all season, United should not be targeting anything other than six points and two polished performances.",
      "But as they have demonstrated once too often this season, United have come unstuck when facing one of the Premier League's lesser clubs on their own patch this season, losing to the likes of Fulham (2-1) and Crystal Palace (1-0). They only managed to scrape past Luton Town by a solitary goal at Old Trafford.",
      "With pressure mounting on Ten Hag after a run of four games without a win and just one win in seven in the league, the outcome of United's next three games could end up making Sir Jim Ratcliffe's decision for him as far as the Dutchman's future is concerned. He has made sweeping changes to the club's hierarchy and the manager's position is not immune to a change, either.",

      "Man United have been heavily linked with the possibility of signing Benfica midfielder Joao Neves in recent months.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic has advised Joao Neves to stay at Benfica for now amid reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "United, who are gearing up to face Coventry City in the semi-finals of the FA Cup at Wembley on Sunday, are set to be in the mix for a new defensive-midfielder this forthcoming summer. Casemiro, now 31, has regressed at an alarming rate this season and is need of replacing.",
      "According to a report coming out of Portugal earlier this week, United have installed Neves, 19, as their top target for the summer. A report also claimed United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe had 'met' Neves' agent – who is renowned 'super agent' Jorge Mendes – to 'discuss' the possibility of a transfer for the youngster.",
      "Neves has excelled for Benfica this season, racking up 50 appearances in all competitions and chipping in with three goals. Though he is primarily a defensive midfielder, he can also operate as a box-to-box midfield player.",
      "Widely considered as one of the most exciting midfielders in Europe, links to clubs of United's stature comes as little surprise. However, former United star Matic – who spent five years at Old Trafford between 2017 and 2022 – believes it would be in the youngster's best interest to continue his development at Benfica for the time being.",
      "\"I think it's too early for him to take that step of leaving,\" Matic told Portuguese newspaper O Jogo. \"If I were him, I would stay at Benfica for a few more years to play in the Champions League and to mature more.",
      "\"I'm sure his time will come and, therefore, he doesn't need to rush. Joao is already at a big club at this point.",
      "\"I'm sure his future at Benfica will be very good. I think it's too early to leave, but of course, in the end, it's always his decision.\"",
      "Neves, who started all six of Benfica's matches in the Champions League earlier this season, has been heavily linked with a move to United in recent weeks. Last month, United skipper Bruno Fernandes, who spent time with the youngster on international duty, said he was 'ready' to make the jump to a big club.",
      "Fernandes said: \"I don’t know if United rumours are true, but I know he is ready for that big jump. He is an excellent player, he's with the national team. That's also why the big clubs are after him.\"",

      "\"What we missed in our squad was behind Casemiro, another one, typical holding midfielder. So with him, we have one,\" Ten Hag said about Amrabat after his loan move.",
      "\"But also Amrabat can play alongside Casemiro because he is also capable of playing in a higher position on the pitch, also he can play as a wing-back or full-back.\"",
      "Ten Hag forgot to mention the fifth role that Amrabat could play: the bench warmer and an extra body in training at Carrington to prepare for matches.",
      "Unfortunately for Amrabat, he's made just one start - in the FA Cup - across all competitions in 2024 and he's become an irrelevance in the second half of the season.",
      "That start came in the 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the fifth round of England's oldest cup competition and his last start before that came against Liverpool in December.",
      "Amrabat has played just over 1,100 minutes in a United shirt, which means he's averaged 157 minutes each month since his arrival and that emphasises his peripheral status.",
      "The 27-year-old travelled to the Africa Cup of Nations with Morocco in January and nobody suggested his absence would be a blow because he's hardly played for United.",
      "There was a small section of the fanbase on social media that said Amrabat would be the club's saviour this season, one of the final pieces to the midfield jigsaw.",
      "The analytics community pointed to his promising statistics with Fiorentina in Serie A, while others based their opinions on watching Amrabat at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
      "There is a clip of Amrabat powerfully sprinting back and tackling Kylian Mbappe that is repeatedly shared, but having a highlight reel on YouTube does not correlate with being a quality player.",
      "Amrabat has looked below the standard required when he's played and it's a damning indictment of how he's become viewed by Ten Hag that he's not starting over Casemiro.",
      "Casemiro has been a passenger for months in the midfield, his passing has been wayward and his positioning questionable, so the drop-off in his performances has been stark.",
      "United paid €10million (around £8.5m) to sign Amrabat on loan from Fiorentina and he was signed to deputise for Casemiro, yet he's failed to get the nod over the declining Brazilian.",
      "Amrabat seems like a good character to have in the dressing room and he's been likeable in interviews, but he's judged on the pitch and he's struggled to get onto it.",
      "The €10m loan fee must be considered a waste and it's probably at least 1000/1 odds that United will trigger their option to sign him on a permanent deal this summer for €25m.",
      "It's understood there were doubts about signing Amrabat among some recruitment staff and with the benefit of hindsight, such concerns about the transfer had merit.",
      "Ten Hag, who previously worked with Amrabat at Utrecht, pushed to sign him regardless but has abandoned him with the business end of the season having arrived.",
      "Amrabat can be added to the catalogue of underwhelming signings at United.",

      "United were first linked with a move for Onana at the beginning of the campaign as they looked to add options to their midfield. The Manchester Evening News understands United are continuing to monitor Onana, along with Everton teammate Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Erik ten Hag could be heading back into the race to sign a defensive midfielder this coming summer after Casemiro's form dipped dramatically this season. Beyond Casemiro, the Reds have been light in the defensive midfield area of the pitch this season and could reinforce their midfield options when the summer transfer window opens, with the Brazilian having been tentatively linked with a potential move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "In January, as Everton's Financial Fair Play (FFP) woes deepened, Arsenal and Newcastle United were heavily linked with Onana's signature but again the move did not come through. Still, the Belgian did little to impress at Stamford Bridge on Monday night as he was hauled off at half-time during Everton's 6-0 defeat to Chelsea.",

After a tough start to life at Old Trafford, breaking his Premier League duck had opened the floodgates and a double against the Hatters made it eight goals in as many games.",
      "But then came an injury and a month of inaction and as quickly as he went from cold to hot over Christmas, his temperature plummeted once more. It is now 405 minutes without a goal since his return and more concerningly there have been just three shots in that time.",
      "In his spell of looking like an unstoppable Premier League striker, between Boxing Day and February 18, Hojlund had 16 shots in eight games, but he's barely influenced recent fixtures and United's results have turned in accordance with their £72million striker starting to look goal shy once again.",
      "Hojlund played the full game in those successive draws against Liverpool and Bournemouth but didn't have a single shot and managed 60 touches across 180 minutes. Bruno Fernandes is picking up the goalscoring slack for now, but United need Hojlund to catch fire once more.",
      "Not only is it essential that the club's leading striker scores goals, but with Anthony Martial leaving Old Trafford this summer, a new striker is towards the top of the shopping list in the first window under the influence of Ineos. If Hojlund remains in a funk and continues to look like a striker capable of going through streaky spells of good and bad, then the dilemma of the profile of forward to sign becomes more of an issue.",
      "During that mid-winter spell, Hojlund had started to look like the right deal. He began to lead the line with the quality as well as the confidence of a United No.9, but it has to be a concern that he is struggling to maintain that kind of form. With potentially eight games of this season to go, United will want to see a return to that level.",
      "Goals from Hojlund will help in a battle with Newcastle - and potentially Chelsea - for sixth place and they could be vital if a spot in the FA Cup final is secured. But they would also allay any fears of needing another elite striker to help score the weight of goals expected next season.",
      "In a summer when United are set to miss out on Champions League football and continue to balance FFP issues, they could do without the requirement of buying a proven goalscorer. In spending £72million on Hojlund last summer, that is what they hoped to have got.",
      "United always accepted that the Dane was a work in progress and there have been times when the potential has looked ready to blossom. Now in spring time it needs to do just that. This season isn't without mitigation for him either, given how poorly the team has played at times.",
      "The 21-year-old looks to have what it takes to carry the pressure and the burden of being the main man at United. Erik ten Hag has lauded his bravery and character this season and during his run of goals, he revealed what Hojlund was like when things weren't going for him.",
      "\"I can tell you it’s not easy for a striker when you have high expectations from yourself, also the outside world has high expectations, to fulfil that when it’s not working,\" he said.",
      "\"That is the character every striker needs, he gets angry, he gets mad when he’s not scoring, but that’s why we selected him, he has the resilience and the calmness to perform under that stress.\"",
      "That stress will have started to return now, but Hojlund has already shown once that not only can he overcome it, but that one goal can lead to a hatful. Finishing the season in that style would be beneficial for several reasons.",

      "The duo have played starring roles in helping Leverkusen clinch the Bundesliga crown, making 50 appearances between them. Frimpong has excelled at right wing-back, scoring eight goals and registering seven assists, while Tapsoba has been solid at centre-back.",
      "Naturally, interest in both players has increased over the course of this season, meaning they may be forced to cash in come the summer. And according to Carro, they will almost certainly have to sell one of their star assets to generate funds for new additions.",

      "Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.",
      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "Jadon Sancho's time at Man United is coming to an end after his public disagreement with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Monster Man United summer transfer move is needed - and Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a big call to make",
      "With just over a month of the Premier League campaign remaining, it is hardly surprising that more and more transfer speculation is starting clog up the online gossip columns.",
      "One of the biggest stories to have surfaced so far this week has been a report claiming Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has 'met' super agent Jorge Mendes and 'discussed' the possibility of signing two of his clients ahead of this summer - Benfica's Joao Neves and AC Milan forward Rafael Leao.",
      "United have been heavily linked with Neves' signature in recent months while Leao has been linked with a move to Old Trafford at various stages in his career. According to Portuguese newspaper Record, United plan to make 'two blockbuster signings' this forthcoming summer.",
      "The upcoming transfer window, of course, will mark an important juncture in United's history. Following Ratcliffe's investment in February, Ineos now oversee all football-related activity at the club and recruitment is going to play a fundamental role in their quest to take the club forward.",
      "Fresh links connecting United with Leao, however, are somewhat difficult to get onboard with. The Portuguese international, who is a highly versatile forward, has been around for sometime, despite only being 24, and would almost certainly command a fee in excess of £100million in the current market.",
      "United, this forthcoming summer, are unlikely to prioritise the addition of a winger, which is Leao's natural position, though speculation continues to surround the future of Marcus Rashford. Instead, United need to try and focus as much of their energy as possible on recruiting a successor for Casemiro.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's development means he will almost certainly be a shoo-in in United's strongest midfield next season, while it is hard to imagine Bruno Fernandes losing his place anytime soon. It means the stage is set for United to recruit a new defensive-midfielder, who can provide discipline and a strong element of control, to complement the qualities of both Mainoo and Fernandes.",
      "Neves, who does not turn 20 until November, has been regularly linked with a move to M16 in recent months and reports coming out of Portugal have stated he has been identified as United's 'top target' to strengthen their midfield. Despite his age, he has embedded himself as a key figure at Benfica this season, making 50 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Benfica, primarily, operate with a 4-2-3-1 system and Neves occupies one of the two defensive-midfield berths in front of the back-four. As well as being happy to roll up his sleeves and contribute the dirty side of the game, he is also happy to distribute the ball from deep and make progressive carries.",
      "Looking at United's midfield as it is now, Casemiro has often been too exposed, with Mainoo's hunger to get forward and support the attacking play leaving the Reds somewhat vulnerable. Mainoo is displaying the hallmarks of a progressive No.8 and not a dominant No.6, whose main focus is on tackling and doing the ugly stuff.",
      "It means United need to nail their recruitment of a new No.6, who can dominate the midfield enough to allow Mainoo to push high in support of Fernandes. Erik ten Hag, as was proven with his pursuit of Frenkie de Jong two years ago, wants a midfielder who can control possession and dictate.",
      "Neves boasts a 90 per cent passing accuracy in Primeira Liga this season and has completed 61 per cent of attempted dribbles, suggesting he does have it in his locker to do more than provide defensive solidity. While the standard of the Portuguese top flight is not as high as the Premier League, he has already been backed to perform at the 'highest level'.",
      "Former Benfica scout Boto, speaking to Record last year, said: \"I'm not surprised that all the big European clubs are paying attention, Benfica could earn a lot of money in the future with his sale. There's no doubt in my mind that, regardless of Benfica's season, he'll be worth a lot at the end of the year.",
      "\"At his age, he combines talent with impressive dynamism in midfield and above-average maturity, something he demonstrates with every performance he makes. He shows that he's ready to play at the highest level and has a huge scope for progression. He's a player who impresses and whose faults are hard to find.\"",

      "We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners. If you don’t like our community, you can check out any time you like. If you’re curious, you can read our Privacy Notice.",
      "Such is Neves' profile and the steep trajectory he is on at such a young age, a move for his signature will not be cheap to facilitate. He is under contract until 2028 and is release clause is reportedly worth €100m, which converts to around £86m.",
      "Back in January, Benfica denied they had entered into talks with United about signing the start, even going as far as issuing a statement which read: \"Benfica denies the existence of any right of preference over its player Joao Neves. Under no circumstances did Benfica enter into talks with Manchester United or any other club about this player - nor does it intend to do so. Any information that points in another direction is false.\"",
      "That was then, however, and things change. United's need for reinforcements this summer - especially in midfield - will see them move for someone.",
      "There's little doubt that Neves would provide aggression and ball-playing expertise to United's midfield, providing them with two qualities they desperately need. Whether the price of clinching his signature - given their need to box clever in the summer market - proves too much is what Ratcliffe & Co must weigh up - with a little help, no doubt, from a super agent.",

      "Former Manchester United loanee Marcel Sabitzer was the hero for new side Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night as they booked their place in the Champions League semi-final.",
      "The German side came from 2-1 down in the first leg to beat Atletico Madrid 5-4 on aggregate. Goals from Julian Brandt, Ian Maatsen, Niclas Fullkrug, and Sabitzer gave them a 4-2 win on the night which was enough to see them through.",
      "The winning goal came just a few days after the 30-year-old scored both of the team’s goals in a 2-1 Bundesliga win over Borussia Monchengladbach and was his sixth strike of the season. Not only did Sabitzer score the winning goal, he also provided assists for two teammates during the game, meaning he played a part in three of the four Dortmund goals.",
      "His performance may leave United fans and Erik ten Hag thinking what could have been. The midfielder only completed a transfer to Dortmund in the summer after spending some time on loan at Old Trafford.",
      "Sabitzer joined United on a six-month loan from Bayern Munich in January 2023. He made 18 appearances for the club, scoring three times and providing one assist, two of those goals came in the Europa League quarter-final first-leg draw against Sevilla, United went on to lose the second leg 3-0.",
      "After joining Dortmund on a permanent deal in the summer, the midfielder delivered a verdict on his short spell at United. “I remember a lot of things from my time at Manchester United,\" he told Dortmund’s club media.",
      "“I was very impressed by the fact of having played for a club of such stature. I had a smile every day at the thought of being there and playing.",
      "“It's also because I had playing time [at United] that I found my rhythm and my self-confidence. I showed good things there and that has an impact because a year and a half ago everyone doubted me. When you can prove again that you can play a part in big clubs like this, it's good for confidence.”",
      "Later, in an interview with the Athletic back in November, Sabitzer had specific praise for Ten Hag and his tactical knowledge. “You can wake him up at 3am, he’d tell you his whole match plan by heart,\" he said.",
      "\"He’s very knowledgeable about football and tactics — a very hard worker, a perfectionist. And he’s very straight with you. When I had a bad game, he showed me some situations and told me how to do it better next time. I liked that.",
      "\"You knew where you stood with him. He never threw you under the bus. Instead, he told players to go out and do better in the next game. I learned a lot about football working under him. He’s a very good coach.”",
      "The loan move to United looked like it would be made permanent in the summer, only for injury to cut Sabitzer’s season short. The midfielder revealed how he tried to play through the pain to make the move happen.",
      "“I already picked up the injury two weeks into my stay and then played through the pain because I wanted to make it work,” he said. “But at one point, I couldn’t go on any more and had to have surgery.",
      "“I couldn’t be happier at Dortmund and feel that I’m exactly at the right place right now. I feel the support of the whole club. You need that to perform well.”",
      "Sabitzer will now look to help Dortmund go one step further in the Champions League. They take on Paris Saint Germain in their semi-final after the French giants overcame Barcelona.",

      "Man United could find the challenge of successfully replacing Anthony Martial a difficult one.",
      "Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, changes are in the offing at Manchester United.",
      "With a maximum of just eight games left to play, uncertainty surrounds Erik ten Hag's future, what European competition the club may or may not participate in next season and what the landscape of the squad will look like come next term.",
      "Under the new regime, which is being led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, United are planning for a mass exodus in the summer, with a record number of sales planned. United need to offload a number of players from within their ranks, but some will be harder to shift than others.",
      "The Reds will not have any difficulties in moving on Anthony Martial. His contract is up at the end of the season and he will be released after almost a decade in M16.",
      "His impending exit will leave a void within the squad that will need filling. Once Martial has departed, Rasmus Hojlund will be United's only senior out-and-out centre forward.",
      "Last week, ahead of Saturday's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth, Ten Hag confirmed he plans to beef up his forward line this forthcoming summer with the addition of a new goal-getter, saying: \"I think it would help [to sign a striker]. As I always had in this plan we constructed that we should have had enough goals. You count on goals from Rashy (Marcus Rashford) - last season he had 30 - you count on goals from Martial.",
      "\"In my first season, he played very well and also in very important games he had a high impact on our performances. And then bringing in a goalscorer like Rasmus Hojlund it should have been enough goals.\"",
      "Signing a striker was United's main priority in last summer's transfer window, but there is an argument to suggest strengthening in midfield once again will take priority this time around. Casemiro's decline means the club is crying out for a new No.6 to slot in alongside Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It is unlikely that fulfilling that mission will come cheap, meaning United are going to have to box clever to strengthen other parts of their squad. The full-back and centre-back departments are also in need of attention.",
      "Though there is no doubt United need another striker, Hojlund's addition to the squad last summer for an initial fee of £64million means they are unlikely to spend a similar amount on a second goal-getter in as many years. United are going to have to be mindful of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules [PSR] this summer and know they need to generate funds through sales.",
      "Amid their need for another forward, United are already being linked with the likes of Brentford's Ivan Toney, Viktor Gyökeres of Sporting Lisbon and Napoli star Victor Osimhen. Even Harry Kane is once again being linked with a move to United.",
      "Such links are fanciful, not least because each member of that aforementioned quartet will command an eye-watering transfer fee. Gyökeres, for example, has a €100m (£85.3m at current rate) release clause in his contract.",
      "Furthermore, it is unlikely that Ten Hag, should he remain in charge, will bring in a striker to leapfrog Hojlund in the pecking order. The Dane was signed last August to be United's first-choice striker for the long-term.",
      "It means any striker United turn to in a bid to replace Martial this summer will almost certainly have to be content with a back-up or rotational role. Toney, Gyökeres or Osimhen would not be content with that, with each of them currently occupying the title of chief striker at their current clubs.",
      "The Reds are going to have to be tactful when embarking on this particular mission, all while trying to avoid breaking the bank. Hojlund has scored 13 goals so far this season and will be eager to increase his output in his second campaign in England.",
      "Striking the balance between finding someone who is happy to be second in the pecking order and not command an exaggerated price tag will present a difficult challenge for United's hierarchy. However, it is a challenge they will have to rise to.",

      "Shea Lacey is one the most exciting talents in Man Utd's academy and he's signed his first professional contract with the club.",
      "Manchester United youngster Shea Lacey has signed his first professional contract.",
      "Last month, the Manchester Evening News confirmed Lacey would sign his professional deal once he celebrated his 17th birthday and he's now officially put pen to paper.",
      "Only the most highly-regarded prospects in the academy are given professional terms when they turn 17 - the age when you can sign a pro deal - and Lacey has long been considered one of the leading lights in his age group, which explains why he's been tied down at the first opportunity.",
      "There are high hopes at United for Lacey and he recently took part in first-team training at Carrington following his return from an injury that saw him sidelined for six months.",
      "It's understood that injury was the first of Lacey's blossoming career and his return to fitness should allow him to contribute to the Under-18s at a crucial stage of the season.",
      "After a brilliant campaign, the U18s are set to win their league and have the opportunity to win a trophy when they take on Manchester City on April 23 at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Lacey is expected to play a prominent role as the U18s look to seal the league title in the coming weeks and he's set to represent the Under-21s regularly in 2024/25.",
      "In the last few years, footage of Lacey playing for United's academy has gone viral on social media and such clips have amassed thousands of views.",
      "Lacey was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter and grew up idolising multi-Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.",
      "He has predominately played on the right wing, but coaches in the academy like to challenge youngsters in different positions across the attack and Lacey is versatile.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the City star, his long-term future could lie in playing an attacking midfield role.",
      "Lacey is the latest academy talent to sign his first professional deal at United, following confirmation that Harry Amass and Jack and Tyler Fletcher had been given contracts.",

      "Man United winger Alejandro Garnacho was substituted at half-time against Bournemouth and expressed his frustration on social media.",
      "It took just a few clicks of a phone for Alejandro Garnacho to undermine Erik ten Hag.",
      "Shortly after Manchester United's game against Bournemouth, Garnacho liked tweets questioning his substitution and it was unsurprising to see that undone by the next morning.",
      "On Monday, a United spokesperson said the matter was dealt with internally but declined to clarify whether Garnacho has been outright disciplined by his manager. Garnacho has started 24 games in the Premier League this season and it's stunning that he felt emboldened to publicly question Ten Hag, who has overseen his breakthrough into the first team.",
      "When United travelled to Thailand and Australia for pre-season after Ten Hag's appointment, Garnacho was the outfield player not to receive a single minute when the likes of Ethan Laird, Zidane Iqbal, Charlie Savage and Tahith Chong were all given a chance to play.",
      "Bruno Fernandes later revealed Garnacho 'was not at his best' due to concerns over his attitude and it seemed those types of issues were a thing of the past with the winger.",
      "Garnacho's social media antics last weekend were inadvisable and a regression to who he was on that pre-season tour - a young player who needed to be guided.",
      "That is forgivable to an extent - he's only 19 and everyone does daft things in their teenage years - but he knew liking those tweets would cause trouble and must act better.",
      "United will play Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday and it wouldn't be a surprise to see Garnacho benched or named in the starting line-up again.",
      "Either outcome is plausible given there is a week's break to put the incident behind him, although if Ten Hag does decide to bench him, Garnacho must accept it and move on.",
      "Ten Hag has dealt with several disciplinary issues during his time in charge and there has been a suggestion such problems happen more at United than any other club. But United are the biggest English club and are covered extensively around the world, so any incidents are bound to be magnified and prominent in the news cycle.",
      "Naturally, Cristiano Ronaldo's fallout with Ten Hag was one of the biggest stories in sport, never mind football, and he forced his exit with a bombshell interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "There have also been issues with Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford to address. Sancho was banished from the squad in September after his outburst on social media and Rashford was brought into line after his boozy rendezvous to Belfast in January.",
      "Last season, Rashford was taken out of the starting side against Wolves at Molineux Stadium because he was late to a team meeting in the build-up to that match. Rashford was in prolific form and it was a big decision to remove him from the line-up, but it was the right call and all was forgotten when he scored the winner from the bench.",
      "Some fans have suggested such disciplinary issues are symbolic of the new generation of players and they wouldn't have happened with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge, but the legendary manager dealt with almost every problematic scenario possible during his reign.",
      "Premier League footballers are pampered millionaires and can be difficult to manage, yet Ferguson did it masterfully and every incident was dealt with accordingly.",
      "David Beckham was axed for a game against Leeds in February 2000 after a dispute with Ferguson, Paul Scholes was fined two weeks' wages after refusing to play against Arsenal and Roy Keane left in dramatic circumstances in November 2005 due to his infamous MUTV rant.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy was dropped on the final day of that season after a fallout, Wayne Rooney was removed from the team after eyeing a departure in 2010 and he was disciplined again a year later when going out on New Year's Eve with Jonny Evans and Darron Gibson.",
      "Ashley Young was dropped for diving against Aston Villa in November 2013 and the list could go on, which proves disciplinary issues at United are certainly nothing new.",
      "They're also not exclusive to United. Premier League clubs commonly have issues with players and unfortunately, it's something most managers have to deal with.",
      "\"When I came in at Man United, the standards were not right,\" said Ten Hag last summer and he deserves praise for taking on player power, which had festered in the last few years.",
      "Ferguson made players fall in line when issues arose and Ten Hag has done the same.",

      "Erik ten Hag and Co. will now be focused on preparing to face Coventry City this weekend in the semi-final of the FA Cup. Away from the action on the pitch, United are still being linked with players that could be signed when the transfer window opens in the summer.",
      "One of the latest rumours centres around Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. Reports in Italy have claimed that United could make a move to sign Bremer this summer.",
      "According to Calciomercato, United have been showing an interest in signing Bremer for \"some time\" but it remains to be seen if it will happen this summer. It has been claimed that Bremer has a release clause in his contract worth between €60 million and €70 million (£51m-£60m), but is not able to be activated until 2025.",
      "The report does add, though, that it \"cannot be ruled out\" that Juventus consider letting Bremer leave the club in the summer. Bremer joined the Serie A giants from Torino in 2022 and is reported to be contracted until 2028.",
      "It is claimed that with Cristiano Giuntoli set for his 'first real window' as Juve sporting director following his appointment last year, the Italian outfit could cash in on Bremer to raise funds for a rebuild of their own and the defender may be deemed 'expendable'.",
      "Elsewhere, United are also continuing to be linked with a move for Benfica midfielder Joao Neves. A report from Portuguese news outlet Record has claimed that Neves could leave Benfica this summer.",
      "As well as United, the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City have also been linked with signing the 19-year-old this summer. The report claims that it is \"increasingly likely\" that Neves leaves Benfica at the end of the season.",
      "This is despite the apparent stance from the Primeira Liga club that they do not want the midfielder to leave. Neves is reported to have a release clause in his contract at Benfica worth €120 million (£102 million).",
      "Other reports in recent months have speculated that Benfica would like to agree to a new contract with Neves that would see the release clause increase in an effort to stop a potential exit.",

      "Man United are in desperate need of a new striker in the summer transfer window after failing to add to their forward line in January",
      "Manchester United are reportedly still in the hunt to sign Stuttgart's Serhou Guirassy.",
      "The 28-year-old was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford during the January transfer window following an astonishing campaign in the Bundesliga. However, United were not in a position to spend this winter, and Guirassy's stint at AFCON ensured he remained in Germany.",
      "Since returning to his domestic club, Guirassy has continued to shine and has scored in his last six Bundesliga appearances, including a brace in the victory over Wolfsburg. The forward has 27 goals to his name this season, and according to Sport Bild, United are ready to pounce in the summer.",
      "It is believed a £17m release clause remains active in Guirassy's contract, but United will face a battle to complete a deal with West Ham, who are also thought to be keen. As one striker is pursued to move to Old Trafford, another is set to leave.",
      "Anthony Martial may not play for the Reds again after suffering a groin injury in January. The Frenchman's contract expires at the end of the campaign, and it is widely believed his deal will not be renewed.",
      "Surprisingly, one of United's Premier League rivals is reportedly interested in signing the forward. Tuttosport understands that Tottenham Hotspur are weighing up a move for the soon-to-be free agent to add to their options.",
      "It is claimed the North London club faces competition from Juventus for his signature, but the Turin club is more hesitant over an approach. Martial has scored just twice in 19 appearances for the Reds this season.",

      "Lord Seb Coe has announced that he chaired the first meeting of the Old Trafford regeneration task force on Monday, April 15.",
      "The former British Olympian has joined Manchester United legend Gary Neville, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and others to oversee the redevelopment of Old Trafford. The Reds' stadium has been in desperate need of modification for several seasons, with new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe making it one of his key priorities when he joined the club last year.",
      "In March, the task force was created, and it appears work has now begun to get the project up and running. Confirming the first meeting on X, Coe tweeted: \"Yesterday, I chaired the first meeting of the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force to kick off a conversation about how the development of a world-class football stadium for the north of England can deliver social and economic benefits for the region.",
      "\"At the London 2012 Olympics, I saw first-hand how sport can be a powerful driver of urban regeneration and I am excited to be part of this project. This meeting marked the start of a multi-stakeholder process to explore options for the stadium and surrounding area.",
      "\"We are at the start of this journey, and it is too soon to know where it will lead. But we will consult closely with fans and local residents along the way, and keep everyone informed of progress.\"",
      "Coe was one of the leading figures behind London's successful bid to host the Olympic Games in 2012 which was deemed to be a great success. Ratcliffe's desire is to build a new stadium in the vicinity of Old Trafford.",
      "Explaining his vision in March, the INEOS founder said: \"This can be a major regeneration project for an area of Greater Manchester which has played such a key role in British industrial history, but which today requires new investment to thrive again. The north-west of England has a greater concentration of major football clubs than anywhere else in the world, yet we don’t have a stadium on the scale of Wembley, the Nou Camp or the Bernabeu.",
      "\"We will not be able to change that on our own, which is why this task force is so important to help us seize this once-in-a-century opportunity.\"",

      "Man Utd have suffered a disastrous season and Erik ten Hag has seen his squad decimated by injuries, but two players thrown in at the deep end have thrived.",
      "Searching for positives in this Manchester United season is becoming increasingly difficult. You could probably make a case for Andre Onana, perhaps for Rasmus Hojlund. The FA Cup could yet prove unexpected salvation. But the legacy of this campaign will be what it delivers in years to come, as Erik ten Hag touched on recently.",
      "The injury crisis that has plagued United almost constantly this term has limited Ten Hag's options, but it's also offered up opportunities to youngsters and for the last two weeks United have fielded three teenagers in their starting XI, with Willy Kambwala joining Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho in the team.",
      "Garnacho's promise has simply been fulfilled this season and for all that his social media activity on Saturday caused a stir, that was the 30th successive game he has started in all competitions. Ten Hag deserves credit for allowing the Argentine's talent to shine and he deserves even more credit for throwing Mainoo in at the deep end and allowing him to swim.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional this season and is now a more vital cog in that midfield than Casemiro. He would have played more often but for the ankle injury sustained against Real Madrid in pre-season.",
      "But if Garnacho's involvement was a given and Mainoo's opportunities were also on the cards, it has come sooner than expected for Kambwala, who has been the beneficiary of a defensive injury crisis that has rarely abated.",
      "The French teenager isn't the real deal yet but then which 19-year-old centre-back is? He has also come into a team that offers such little protection to their defence that the position should come with its own health warning.",
      "On a couple of occasions against Liverpool and Bournemouth, he was dragged deep into opposition territory because Diogo Dalot was out of the game. He won a ferocious duel with Luis Diaz on one occasion but was too easily bypassed at the weekend for another Cherries counter.",
      "He found it difficult to keep Dominic Solanke quiet on the south coast, but he isn't the only Premier League centre-back to struggle with that assignment this season. He was left isolated against Solanke for the first goal after United's wretched attempts to play out from the back and then slipped at a crucial moment.",
      "But generally, he has defended well. His recovery pace against Darwin Nunez at Old Trafford was exceptional and he has been trusted in the build-up, perhaps too much given the lack of structure when United play out has left him short of passing options.",
      "Ten Hag was asked about Kambwala after his performance against Liverpool and spoke about how positive the future is with the players coming through at Old Trafford.",
      "\"When old soldiers die, new ones have to come in,\" explained Ten Hag. \"Willy for a long time is training with us, he started at West Ham and did very good, his progress is amazing, we didn’t have any doubts.",
      "\"We were convinced he could do the job, it’s another signal and message for the future of Manchester United. This team and squad has high potential. The future will be very good.\"",
      "Whether Ten Hag gets to oversee that future is looking more and more unlikely. If he is replaced this season then the next man in charge will be thankful to inherit talent of the quality of Kambwala, Mainoo and Garnacho.",
      "The development of the first two this season is a major bonus ahead of what is shaping up to be a testing summer. United are going to miss out on the revenue that comes with Champions League football and are still battling concerns over the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "The emergence of Kambwala will mean United can use the youngster to fill the fourth or fifth centre-back slot in the squad, rather than using some of their transfer budget on signing a more experienced option. That will be vital in what is expected to be a summer of upheaval at the back, with Jonny Evans and Raphael Varane out of contract and the future of Harry Maguire still uncertain.",
      "United will still pursue another centre-back and depending on the future of Casemiro, a holding midfielder might be necessary as well, but in Mainoo they have a player of real quality to fill one of the starting midfield slots already.",
      "A year ago neither Kambwala nor Mainoo had made the step up. Now, both look ready to be part of the first-team squad. That is likely to be a £100million saving, at least, in the transfer market and after a disappointing season on the pitch, it's the kind of bonus that is badly needed ahead of the summer.",

      "Had he been fit and available for selection, he would have been in contention to start after producing a bright cameo performance in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool six days earlier. As a result, Marcus Rashford kept his place in attack alongside Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho in what was an unchanged XI.",
      "After sharing a post on Instagram of himself in an ice bath at the club's Carrington training base on Monday, Antony was photographed participated in Tuesday's main session with the rest of the first-team squad, suggesting he will be in contention for this weekend's tussle with the Sky Blues.",
      "Antony stepped off the bench to score United's second goal in their dramatic 4-3 win over Liverpool last month to book their date with Mark Robins' side. The Brazilian has scored twice in the FA Cup so far this season, also netting in the 4-2 win over Newport County in the fourth round.",
      "Meanwhile, Garnacho also trained with the rest of the squad on Tuesday. The Argentine was the at the centre of controversy following Saturday's draw with Bournemouth, making the decision to 'like' two posts on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, criticising manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Garnacho was substituted at half-time against the Cherries and was replaced by Amad. Ten Hag, post-match, confirmed his decision to withdraw the youngster was primarily tactical.",

      "Man United winger Jadon Sancho was sent on loan to Borussia Dortmund in January after a public fallout with manager Erik ten Hag",

      "On Tuesday, the i Newspaper reported that Sancho had not given up on his stint at the Premier League club despite leaving the club under a cloud. The winger was exiled by Ten Hag in September after the forward accused the manager of lying about his performance levels in training and claimed he was the scapegoat.",
      "But, with Ten Hag under increased pressure due to the Reds' poor performance this season, Sancho may get his wish. However, his focus is currently on Borussia Dortmund, where he enjoyed a brilliant evening.",
      "Despite taking a 2-0 lead on the night, Atletico Madrid managed to fight back to take advantage in the tie at 4-3. However, a crazy three-minute spell saw Niclas Fullkrug and Marcel Sabitzer both score to seal their spot in the last four.",
      "Elsewhere among the United loanees, Mason Greenwood has been advised by former England boss Fabio Capello to leave Old Trafford in the summer. The working assumption is that Greenwood will be sold at the end of the campaign, and Capello thinks Juventus should look to target the winger, who has eight goals and five assists to his name in La Liga.",
      "Meanwhile, Donny van de Beek's hopes of sealing a permanent exit from Old Trafford have taken another blow. Journalist Fabrizio Romano understands Eintracht Frankfurt are not willing to make the Dutch midfielder's move to the club permanent in the summer.",
      "Van de Beek has yet to play a full 90 minutes for his loan team and has made just seven appearances in the Bundesliga. When he arrived at the club in January, the 26-year-old said: \"If you don't play as many games as you want, it's tough, but that's the past now.",
      "\"I'm here now and I'm positive, which is the most important thing and then things can change. I'm looking forward now.",

      "Man Utd have only one thing left to play for this season but they are getting worse rather than better and that is a major problem.",
      "The focus on Manchester United's recent attempts to close the gap to the Champions League places overlooked the real issue facing Erik ten Hag's side. While United eyed up fourth, the reality was they were lucky to be sixth.",
      "By no objective or statistical measurement have United been the sixth-best team in the Premier League this season and Newcastle, West Ham and Chelsea are more of a threat to them than they are to Aston Villa and Tottenham. A run of one win in seven league games has torpedoed the possibility of a top-five finish and left them vulnerable to the chasing pack.",
      "Newcastle leapfrogged them at the weekend, West Ham are two points behind and although Chelsea are six back, they do have two games in hand. The good news for United is a more amenable fixture list that should at least avoid the doomsday scenario of falling out of the top seven and failing to qualify for Europe at all.",
      "First, it is Coventry City in the FA Cup this weekend, then Old Trafford league matches against Sheffield United and Burnley. Three wins from three are essential to steady a season that is threatening to derail even more wildly off course than it already has.",
      "Ten Hag cut an agitated figure in his post-match press conference at Bournemouth and the tension was visible even before he objected to a question about the possibility of this being United's worst-ever Premier League season. They have never finished lower than seventh and still need nine points from six games to beat the tally of 58 from the doomed campaign of two years ago, under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Even if that unwanted record is avoided, it is almost impossible to make a case for Ten Hag to stay beyond the end of this season. John Murtough was the latest senior employee on the football side of the business to depart last week and as Ineos make sweeping changes, the Dutchman is becoming an isolated figure with little in the way of evidence to fall back on.",
      "His desire for people to \"trust the process\" is falling on deaf ears. Yes, injuries continue to blight this season, but they are not an excuse for some of the performances delivered and for the failure to fix tactical issues that are as obvious now as they were in October. That is damning for a manager and his coaching staff.",
      "Ineos have resisted the chance to comment publicly on Ten Hag, but with so much change at the club in the last four months, it is only natural the 53-year-old's position will be reviewed as well. It's difficult to see how Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford can come to any other conclusion than change is required.",
      "If that is the final call then perhaps the ultimate test of just how ruthless Ratcliffe is will come with when it is made. The natural parting point is the end of the season, but this team is getting worse rather than better.",
      "They were fortunate to retreat from the south coast with a point on Saturday night and for the seventh game in a row, they allowed the opposition to have at least 20 shots on their goal. The tally across those seven games now stands at 179 shots against, at an average of just over 25 a game. Is it any wonder they aren't winning very many football matches?",
      "For all Ten Hag's claims that the shot count is misleading because his team are defending deep, four of those seven matches have seen the opposition record an xG of more than 3.0. The other three were between 1.6 and 2.1. It is the kind of level that would normally suggest a relegation battle, it is that bad.",
      "None of this is sustainable and given United are at least as poor now as they were in the autumn, the question has to be asked if delaying the inevitable is a wise tactic. Anyone clinging on to the hope that Ten Hag might survive will point to the FA Cup as his final chance, but just as pressing is whether he is the right man to lead United out at Wembley, presuming they get past Coventry this weekend.",
      "If it is another all-Manchester affair at Wembley on May 25 and United's performance level continues to regress, then there is almost certainly only one outcome. City have dominated both derbies this season and have the measure of Ten Hag's team, a side that concedes too much space in midfield and gives the opposition too many chances. It's not a good formula against a team of City's quality.",
      "Winning the FA Cup could yet salvage something from this miserable season, especially if it does halt City's march to more history, but to increase the chances of that happening change might have to be made in the dugout, even if that involves installing a caretaker.",
      "Right now, it is hard to see how this United side, playing in this style, could upset the odds in what they hope will be their final game of the season.",

The Bournemouth game was the 19-year-old Garnacho's 30th successive start for United and he has been substituted in their four games since the two-hour epic against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-final.",
      "Garnacho flew to Los Angeles after that marathon for international duty. He made his full debut for Argentina on Tuesday, March 26, flew to Manchester on the Wednesday, trained at Carrington on Thursday and again on Friday before starting at Brentford on the Saturday.",
      "When he was hooked in the 59th minute, Garnacho went straight down the tunnel. He was clearly not injured and passing the same dugout where Cristiano Ronaldo had a public hissy fit over his removal two seasons ago was not a good look.",
      "That is the only time Garnacho has gone into hiding. Five days later, he was electric at Chelsea and his substitution with United 3-2 up was, in retrospect, complacent by Ten Hag.",
      "Bar the Chelsea ding-dong, Garnacho's form has not been vintage since the domestic season resumed but that is forgivable. The most successive starts Ronaldo had as a teenager were eight and the last fell on his 20th birthday.",
      "Peaks and troughs for teenage footballers will be drastic. Look at Willy Kambwala against Liverpool and Bournemouth. Garnacho must understand that.",
      "He was anaemic in the first half against Bournemouth and United's positioning down their right-hand side for Justin Kluivert's goal was amateurish. Garnacho's withdrawal raised eyebrows but was nothing out of the ordinary. He came off at the interval away to Wolves and at home to Leicester last season.",
      "Garnacho's stock has continued to soar and his salary has hiked since those games. He believed his own hype as a 17-year-old during the FA Youth Cup run, mimicking Ronaldo's celebration for the winning goal and whipping his shirt off after the clincher. The Stretford End sang \"Viva Garnacho\" that night and he applauded nonchalantly.",
      "Garnacho coveted the number seven shirt in the summer and would be a worthy recipient now. Yet there is the danger of too much, too young and Ten Hag will have sensed that. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial developed an inflated air of entitlement when they were the golden boys at United.",
      "Ten Hag has taken Garnacho to task over his social media activity but United have declined to clarify if the winger was outright disciplined. United have to back the manager, even if he is a dead man walking.",

      "For now, the Newcastle United chief has been placed on gardening leave. Until a resolution has been reached, the British billionaire should take the lead on recruitment at United with the summer transfer window just around the corner.",
      "So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has taken a look at which players the Red Devils should sign from Bayer Leverkusen this summer following their remarkable Bundesliga win.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands that United are keeping tabs on Frimpong, who sees his contract the Bay Arena expire in 2028. The wing-back has featured 27 times for Xabi Alonso's side in the Bundesliga this season, scoring eight goals and providing eight assists.",
      "The 23-year-old has played a crucial role for Bayer Leverkusen in their title-winning campaign, bombing up and down the right flank to excellent effect. Manchester United already have Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Diogo Dalot and Erik ten Hag prefers a back-four making a potential deal slightly more difficult to justify.",
      "One would need to leave in the summer to make a move viable, although whether the player is still available by the time United manage to offload Dalot or Wan-Bissaka is another matter as he's sure to have suitors from all over Europe.",
      "Grimaldo, who sees his contract the Bay Arena expire in 2027, has featured 29 times in the Bundesliga this season, scoring nine goals and recording 13 assists. The 28-year-old wing-back has played just as much of a key role in Alonso's side as Frimpong, though he's also a set-piece specialist.",
      "Grimaldo played left-back in a more conventional back-four during his seven-year stint at Benfica, so he'd be more than capable of slotting into the current United lineup. His potential arrival would cast doubt over Luke Shaw's place in the side, but the England international could very easily tuck inside as the left centre-back – just as he's previously done before for club and country.",
      "Along with Frimpong, United are also keeping tabs on Tapsoba, who sees his contract the Bay Arena expire in 2028. THe defender has featured 23 times in the Bundesliga this season, helping Leverkusen keep 10 clean sheets.",
      "While the 25-year-old centre-half offers great steel and leadership, he's also been paramount to the German outfit's build-up play from the back. With that being said, United could also take a look at Jonathan Tah, who sees his deal expire in June 2025, though he's slightly older at 28. Both would be superb options and not too much separates them.",
      "The crown jewel of Alonso's side. Wirtz, who sees his contract the Bay Arena expire in 2027, has featured 29 times in the Bundesliga this season, scoring 11 goals and providing 10 assists. The 20-year-old attacking midfielder has been really impressive, taking on the responsibility of the 'talisman' role.",
      "Whenever Leverkusen needed somebody to rise to the big occasion, Wirtz would step up. However, there's a few issues; not only would he cost in the region of €100million (£85.4m), according to the CIES Football Observatory, but it's also very likely that every other top club tries to secure his signature this summer.",
      "The Germany international could arguably be the most coveted player in Europe...",

      "Seven senior players are out of contract in the summer while there is uncertainty over the futures of several other squad members amid the upheaval following Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s investment.",
      "United have won one of their past seven league games and fourth-placed Aston Villa are now a near-unassailable 13 points clear of Ten Hag's side. United's plight is so severe they have four points fewer than they had at the same stage under David Moyes in 2013-14 - their worst season in the Premier League era.",

      "The Manchester Evening News asked Ten Hag if Garnacho's withdrawal against Bournemouth was tactical. \"I think we had to repair over the right side,\" Ten Hag explained. \"We didn't play well, the spaces were there. In possession, we had to bring a sub there.",
      "\"Garnacho was during the week not training. Only yesterday. We thought bring some energy and bring some more quality, quality in the sense of cooperation and togetherness on that right-hand side.\"",
      "Garnacho started his 30th successive United game at the Vitality Stadium and the 19-year-old is the frontrunner to receive the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",

      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag managed to win the battle against Cristiano Ronaldo last season but he doesn't have the power to win the war against his latest rebel",
      "When Cristiano Ronaldo was banished for good from Manchester United in November 2022, it was heralded as a victory for Erik ten Hag's new approach.",
      "Ronaldo went rogue with his tell-all interview with Piers Morgan and while he made his own bed by criticising the Glazers, few believed Ten Hag would be backed over a club legend. Yet just a few months into his tenure, United stood firm and the Dutchman came out looking stronger than ever.",
      "But while United's head coach was savouring a victory, an unseen battle was beginning to rear its head. Alejandro Garnacho was coming to the fore in his idol's absence which left Ten Hag with difficult questions to answer.",
      "In his first pre-season tour, the manager picked Garnacho to join the first team but he failed to make any appearances after he was late to two team meetings. This scuppered any hope for the winger out in Asia much to fans' disappointment.",
      "It is true what people say, first impressions count and while United insisted they had worked past any attitude worries, their actions in the media showed otherwise. In October and November of that year, Garnacho was beginning to make strides but soon-to-be captain Bruno Fernandes called him out after a good performance.",
      "\"He knows we expect a lot from him. He wasn't at his best at the beginning of the season,\" he explained.",
      "\"On the tour, he didn't have the best attitude that he should have, but now he's training better and getting his chances. He's deserving of his chances.\"",
      "Ten Hag continued in an interview with Sky Sports after Garnacho's two assists against Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup: \"He still has things to learn but quite obviously we are happy with his development and he can contribute to the team. It depends on his approach, his attitude.",
      "\"When he keeps working then yes, it is possible [for him to play more]. He wants to improve every day. He has to do the right things in his lifestyle. He has the capability.\"",
      "Garnacho kept his head down and was eventually offered a new long-term deal in April 2023. On what was a huge day for the teenager, Ten Hag gave an emotive speech in front of the youngster's family at Carrington.",
      "During the speech, the Dutchman once again stressed that Garnacho needed to keep pushing forward, hoping this new contract would inspire him to greatness. With Ronaldo firmly out of the picture, there was hope among the fanbase that the Argentine would inherit not only his chant but his iconic number seven shirt too.",
      "However, this was not to be as Mason Mount was given the nod and Garnacho had to settle for the minor upgrade to 17. Fast forward to the start of this season and the 19-year-old was given a bit-part role leading to concerns that the forward was once again out of Ten Hag's good books, particularly as Antony was consistently being picked ahead of him.",
      "But the turning point would come in late November and perhaps signalled the start of the power shifting in the relationship between player and coach. Garnacho produced not only a goal of the season but perhaps a goal of the century candidate as his stunning bicycle kick launched a comfortable 3-0 win at Everton.",
      "Afterwards, Ten Hag claimed his young winger had the potential for greatness but continued to stress the importance of finding consistency. Such words may have begun to fall on deaf ears though as Garnacho's stock rose and the United manager's began to diminish.",
      "While Ten Hag has been fielding questions about his job security, Garnacho has become a fan favourite and has been hailed as the future of United alongside Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo. This future has increasingly begun to look like it does not involve the current boss.",
      "Finally, we reach the events of Saturday evening which lie as a milestone for both parties. Garnacho 'liked' two tweets from well-known United supporter Mark Goldbridge criticising Ten Hag's decision to replace him against Bournemouth, before later unliking them.",
      "United say the matter has now been dealt with but it raises questions about Ten Hag amid uncertainty around his future at Old Trafford. While 16 months ago, Ten Hag was on top and held the authority, he cannot afford to be drawn into a power struggle with 'CR7 2.0'.",
      "Few believe that Garnacho has been the problem this season and the sharks are now circling Ten Hag. He must now hope to keep this incident in-house because this time if it is a choice between the player and coach, it will almost certainly be the player who wins.",

      "Man United beat Chelsea to reach the Women's FA Cup final but their progress provides a dilemma for new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe",
      "When Marc Skinner leads his Manchester United team out at Wembley Stadium next month, he will do so in the knowledge that it is the biggest afternoon in the club's history.",
      "Less than two decades since the Glazer regime opted to disband the women's team, deeming it not to be part of United's \"core business\", the Reds will have a golden chance to clinch their first-ever piece of silverware as they take on Tottenham Hotspur in the Women's FA Cup final. But, if toppling Spurs would go some way to exorcising some of the ghosts of the club's error-strewn past, then a glimpse at the directors' box on Sunday, May 12, might just offer the clearest insight yet into the landscape of United's future.",
      "Since the installation of Sir Jim Ratcliffe as the club's part-owner in February, there has been little indication from the INEOS chief that the women's team ranks highly on his list of priorities. While he has been spotted in the crowd at Old Trafford on multiple occasions since the turn of the year, he is yet to watch Skinner's side in action at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "With that in mind, his presence at Wembley next month is paramount if players, coaching staff and fans alike are to be convinced of his commitment to their cause. Of course, the fact there is another big game taking place that same afternoon means Ratcliffe's attendance at the national stadium is not a foregone conclusion. Some 200 miles away, United's men's team will also be in action as they host title-chasing Arsenal in the Premier League.",
      "With a mere two hours between the two kick-off times, the Reds' new minority shareholder finds himself with a big decision to make: Watch Erik ten Hag's side attempt to upset one of United's major rivals and bolster their chances of European qualification or be there for what might transpire to be the most momentous occasion in the history of the club's women's team?",
      "It sounds like an easy choice but, if Ratcliffe fails to make the right one, it will set the wrong precedent ahead of what many hope will be the start of a brave new era for United Women. The 71-year-old was rather evasive when asked earlier this year about his ambitions for Skinner's side.",
      "\"If it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt, then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful,\" he told reporters in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, before suggesting the 'ladies' team could make the switch to a regenerated Old Trafford at some unspecified point in the future.",
      "In fairness to Ratcliffe, overseeing the workings of a football powerhouse like United is a mammoth task. His in-tray almost certainly congested with matters pertaining to the men's team, with questions over the manager's future, the make-up of the playing squad and a potential stadium rebuild among the issues that will likely be occupying his mind at present.",
      "He is, first and foremost, a businessman and thus he will rightly invest much of his time into nurturing the club's biggest money-maker. But, with women's football forecast to be a billion-pound industry within the next decade, neglecting the women's team at this juncture would constitute a real misstep by United's new part-owner.",
      "It has been a turbulent season for the Reds, who currently find themselves fourth in the Women's Super League (WSL), 15 points adrift of league leaders and bitter rivals Manchester City. They are unlikely to qualify to Europe, having this season been knocked out of the Champions League in the first qualifying round, and also bowed out of the Continental League Cup in the group stage.",
      "It marks quite the departure from last term, when United recorded the third-highest points tally in WSL history, taking the title race to the final day before ultimately being pipped to the trophy by Chelsea. Emma Hayes' side also won out in last season's FA Cup final but, after dispatching the holders in the semi-finals at the weekend, there is hope of salvation for United when they face off against Spurs under the Wembley arches next month.",
      "It was a superb display from Skinner's side on Sunday afternoon, with the hosts taking the lead inside 41 seconds at Leigh Sports Village, before veteran striker Rachel Williams added to Lucia Garcia's opener after 23 minutes. Lauren James' strike on the stroke of half-time threatened to spoil United's party but a gutsy defensive showing - plus some superb saves from Mary Earps - saw the Reds hold on to defeat Chelsea for the first time in their history.",
      "\"I will be very clear, we've won nothing yet - it will be an incredibly tough final,\" Skinner said after the game. The United boss, though, will have been the most relieved man in the stadium when the referee blew her full-time whistle, fully aware that the victory could go a long way to enhancing fan sentiment at a time where his future at the club is in jeopardy.",
      "Last week, The Athletic reported that talks are ongoing over a new deal for the 41-year-old that would see him stay in his post beyond this summer. It would be a controversial move, considering United's irrefutable regression this term, but perhaps one that would be vindicated should Skinner get United over the line next month.",
      "Of course, it is not just the manager's future that needs to be addressed in order to turn the Reds into a global superpower. Investment in the playing squad and the stabilistion of the behind-the-scenes structure are among some of the other matters that will need to be addressed if United are to be consistently competing for the continent's top honours.",
      "\"To win a trophy with this club I’ve been at for five seasons would be everything,\" goalkeeper Earps told BBC Sport after the win over Chelsea. \"We’ve got to stay focused on that because it's not going to be an easy game. Hopefully it (will be) ours but we’ve got to earn it. It’s not going to be easy, no way.\"",
      "Perhaps Ratcliffe and co. can take their own learnings from Earps' post-match comments. United do not have a divine right to be an elite women's team simply because of the crest on their shirt. Whatever future success they have will have to be earned.",
      "And, while making an appearance at Wembley would by no means guarantee that success, it would be a pretty good place for Ratcliffe to start.",

      "That's when former Premier League midfielder Huddlestone, who has played for Tottenham, Derby, Hull and England, was brought into the club to succeed McShane. Huddlestone took up the player-coach role in the academy in August 2022 and those who are unfamiliar with United's youth set-up are still surprised to see him feature for the Under-21s, despite him now coming to the end of his second season in his position.",
      "The hybrid role has been a huge success and even Liverpool have followed suit, with the Merseyside club bringing former player Jay Spearing back into their academy.",

      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner has reportedly been offered a new deal despite the Reds' disappointing season",
      "In a week where two Premier League clubs were hit with points deductions and Liverpool were eviscerated by Atalanta in the Europa League, it is Manchester United who have conspired to deliver what is arguably the most eyebrow-raising football story of the last seven days.",
      "For months it has felt as if Marc Skinner, manager of the women's team since 2021, is on borrowed time. After taking the title race to the final day and reaching the FA Cup final last term, there is a sense his side have now veered drastically off course, with the Reds having had disappointing runs in both the Champions League and Continental League Cup and currently sitting 15 points off leaders Manchester City in the Women's Super League (WSL).",
      "That there remains a chance of FA Cup glory this season offers some hope of salvation for Skinner but the revelation that a new contract could be on the cards for the 41-year-old is being viewed in some quarters as an indictment of the club's long-term ambitions. On Tuesday, The Athletic reported talks are ongoing between both parties as they endeavour to thrash out a new deal that would see Skinner stay in his post beyond this summer.",
      "READ MORE:Mary Earps' Lionesses status under threat as Sarina Wiegman unleashes England's two rising stars",
      "Considering that banners calling for the manager's removal have been visible in United away ends up and down the country since the turn of the year, it feels like a bold and slightly perplexing choice for the club's decision makers to opt to extend his tenure at Leigh Sports Village - particularly as it was hoped the arrival of new part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe would signal a bright new dawn for a women's team that have, until very recently, been treated as something of an afterthought by one of Europe's most behemothic footballing institutions.",
      "The INEOS chief has not gone into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during any of his dealings with the press but there is certainly an argument that rewarding the Reds boss with a new deal would be in opposition with Ratcliffe's desire to make United the best in class in every department.",
      "\"Of course I want to stay,\" Skinner said when quizzed on his future in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"I'm at a club that, not only do I love the history of it, I love what is going to come in the future. It's a club that has fantastic fans, incredible fans. I want to build sustained success over a period of time. That's what the INEOS remit is as well. We want to build success over a long period of time. I'm absolutely on board with that.",
      "\"As soon as any updates are here we will let you know but my job remains firmly in the focus of the team and what we've got to do for the games coming up.\"",
      "Indeed, this weekend's game is irrefutably the biggest of United's season, with the Reds set to host Chelsea in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. A trip to Wembley next month and the chance to yield what would be the club's first major piece of silverware would perhaps help enhance fan sentiment towards Skinner but even that may not be enough to mask what has been something of a calamitous campaign for the Reds.",
      "Last term, United finished the season with 56 points: the third-highest tally in WSL history. They lost only twice and eventually missed out on the title by just two points, with Chelsea also narrowly pipping them to the FA Cup trophy.",
      "It marked the first time the club had finished in the top three and therefore earned a European spot, with Skinner deserving credit for the significant progress made by his side. Fast forward to now, though, and the picture looks very different.",
      "Want to keep up to date with the latest breaking WSL stories and important news from across women's sport while on the move? Join the club!",

      "You can also buy every edition of our Women's Football News magazine, up to and including the latest release packed full of exclusive news and interviews, right here.",
      "United are almost certain to miss out on a Champions League place this season and exited the continent's premier club competition in the first qualifying round. They have regressed in almost every single metric - with the alarming rate at which they are conceding goals having more than doubled from 0.55 goals per game to 1.28 - and have won just nine of their 18 league matches.",
      "These are not statistics that particularly point to a club on the right path. And, while there's an argument that Skinner has credit in the bank based on what he achieved last term, it could also be debated whether rewarding mediocrity aligns with INEOS' overall vision for the club.",
      "Of course, there are some caveats to United's drop-off in form. In January, Skinner asserted United need to be more aggressive in the transfer market if they are serious about challenging for Europe's top honours. \"If we’re going to chase down Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City,\" he said, \"we’ve got to continue to invest to the levels that they are.\"",
      "Certainly, one look at a list of the 10 most expensive WSL transfers of all time will tell you United have not coughed up quite as much cash as some of their rivals, with summer signing Geyse the only Reds player to feature in that category. Chelsea, meanwhile, have four of the top ten while Man City have three.",
      "Then there is the inescapable truth that United have failed in their mission to tie down some of their biggest names to new contracts in recent times. Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle, two of the Reds' star performers last term, both left in the summer on free transfers after protracted negotiations over new deals failed to bear fruit.",
      "The fact goalkeeper and England No.1 Mary Earps could follow suit when her own contract expires in June seems to indicate the club have not learnt from their mistakes. Another mitigating factor out of Skinner's control is United's desperately bad injury luck, with three of the club's summer signings - Gabby George (ACL), Emma Watson (ACL) and Hinata Miyazawa (knee) - having spent much of the campaign on the sidelines.",
      "It must also be noted that there has been significant disruption behind the scenes at the club, with the departure of assistant manager, Martin Ho, being keenly felt within Skinner's squad. Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann on a two-year deal in July, while several other key personnel - including physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem and performance analyst Luke Wright - have moved over to join Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "With head of women’s football Polly Bancroft also set to leave this summer to take up a new job as Chief Executive of Grimsby Town, it's perhaps little wonder the Reds have so often appeared in flux on the pitch this term. And Skinner doesn't have to look too far for an example of the benefits of managerial continuity, with Man City currently reaping the rewards of sticking by head coach Gareth Taylor.",
      "The Blues failed to qualify for the Champions League last season but kept faith in Taylor's ability to turn things around. He has repaid that faith by guiding City to the brink of their first league title since 2016 this season.",
      "Still, it is hard to shake the feeling that a shake-up in the dugout would provide United with the best chance of success in the near future, even if United do manage to progress to the FA Cup final this weekend.",
      "“Chelsea is probably the toughest challenge within football,\" Skinner said of Sunday's opponents, \"especially in England.\" While that may be true, it could also be argued that convincing the sceptics of his own managerial abilities looks to be a pretty tough task for the United boss. At present, it seems, he is losing the fight.",

      "Tuesday night marked the first time Earps failed to start a competitive game for her country since September 2022 and the competition for England's No.1 spot is heating up",
      "When the teamsheets were distributed at Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Tuesday night, few will have been surprised to see Sarina Wiegman ring the changes for England's clash with the Republic of Ireland.",
      "The Lionesses' EURO 2025 qualifying campaign had got off to a slightly tepid start with a 1-1 stalemate with Sweden just four days prior and the need for a radical shake-up of personnel was glaring. It was, though, somewhat of a shock to see longstanding No. 1 Mary Earps replaced in the starting lineup by up-and-coming Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.",
      "Earps has been close to an ever-present in this England side for much of Wiegman's tenure. The Manchester United shot-stopper started every game at EURO 2022, helping the Lionesses to clinch their first-ever major trophy, and also starred as they reached the Women's World Cup final last summer.",
      "She is - as her two consecutive FIFA trophies attest to - the best in the world in her position, having only been anointed the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year a few short months ago. And yet, for the first time in almost three years, her selection for England does not appear to be a foregone conclusion.",
      "Instead, it was Hampton who was given the nod against Eileen Gleeson's side and, while there is little doubt Earps would be reinstated between the sticks if England were contesting a major tournament this summer, there is a very real chance it will be a different story next year, when the European Champions will hope to defend their crown in Switzerland.",
      "It was Hampton's first competitive appearance for the Lionesses in two years and the first time Earps had failed to start a competitive game for her country since September 2022. \"It's not down to an injury,\" Wiegman confirmed to ITV before the match. \"I think we're in a very luxurious position that we have two incredible goalkeepers.",
      "\"As we saw with Mary on Friday, she did an incredible job but I also think that Hannah is doing a great job for Chelsea. She's growing into competition with Mary so this is a moment for her to shine.\"",
      "Admittedly, it was not Hampton's finest showing. Though the 23-year-old kept a clean sheet in what was largely a routine England win, there were a couple of occasions where she looked slightly shaky in possession, despite making a decent save from Caitlin Hayes late on.",
      "But the mere fact she was called upon in what was arguably England's most important game since that World Cup final defeat to Spain back in August speaks volumes, and Earps - whose United contract expires this summer - will know she has a battle on her hands to prove she should remain as Wiegman's undisputed No. 1 going forwards.",
      "Of course, the main battleground for the United goalkeeper to state her case will be in the Women's Super League (WSL). It is here where Hampton and current England third-choice Khiara Keating - who was forced to withdraw from this month's camp with a knee injury - currently have the edge over their elder stateswoman.",
      "Though she is yet to win a senior England cap, 19-year-old Keating has been a revelation for Manchester City this term and is currently leading the way in many of the top flight's goalkeeping metrics. According to Opta data, the teenager has prevented more than seven goals that would otherwise have been expected to be scored in the WSL.",
      "Hampton, meanwhile, has prevented just under three while Earps ranks fourth in that category (behind Chelsea's Zecira Musovic) with a score of 0.8. In terms of clean sheets, Keating again leads the way with seven in 18 games.",
      "Earps is just behind her with six, though Hampton has the best clean sheet percentage out of the three, having registered five in just eight WSL matches. Still, when it comes to the ultimate intangibles such as the ability to keep a cool head under pressure and excel for England on the biggest stage, Earps remains peerless.",
      "She is just one appearance shy of reaching the 50-cap milestone for the Lionesses and has kept an impressive 25 clean sheets for her country. In an age where the standard of goalkeeping in the women's game has been a lightning rod for scepticism and derision, Earps has moved the goalposts.",
      "Not content with proving critics wrong on the pitch, she has changed the narrative off it. Those replicas of her England shirt sold out within five minutes of going on sale following her lobbying of sportswear giant Nike is proof enough of that.",
      "\"Of course, she was disappointed because she wants to play,\" Wiegman said when quizzed on Earps' reaction to being benched on Tuesday. \"She has been so good for us and very consistent. Yes, she was disappointed, we had that conversation. Then she just showed up and moved on.\"",
      "Whether Hampton has done enough to convince the England boss to give her a start in May's clash with group leaders France remains to be seen. From an England perspective, the fact that Wiegman now has three credible goalkeeping options to consider is a huge positive as the Lionesses seek to return to the formidable force they were two years ago.",
      "For Earps, though, the focus now must be on finishing the domestic season strongly and showing doubters that, while form may be temporary, class is permanent.",

      "United's dismal campaign continued with a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad on Saturday afternoon",
      "With Manchester United a goal down at the Etihad, manager Marc Skinner turned frustratedly to his bench.",
      "\"Why aren't they keeping the ball?\" he asked his coaching staff as his players struggled to repel the sky-blue tidal wave that continued to make advances toward the United penalty area. His agitation, it seems, was entirely justified as, mere minutes later, his side were 2-0 down and staring down the barrel of their fifth Women's Super League (WSL) defeat of the season.",
      "\"The games that we have left, we will give everything,\" Skinner vowed to the media in his post-match press conference. \"That's what we'll always do, that's what this team is built on, it's what Manchester United is built on.\"",
      "In fairness, Skinner could hardly have been expected to say anything else. Saturday's 3-1 defeat in east Manchester means his team are now 15 points worse off than the league leaders - a fact that only becomes more sobering when you consider it is their city rivals who currently occupy that top spot.",
      "They are six points adrift of Europe, with that gap likely to widen when third-place Arsenal face off with Aston Villa tomorrow. In fact, should Liverpool avoid defeat in the Merseyside derby on Sunday afternoon, United will end the weekend in fifth place.",
      "It is quite the fall from grace for a side who missed out on the title by just two points last term and were only narrowly beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup final. It is fair to say that if the Reds came into this season riding the crest of a wave sparked by their previous successes, then their tumultuous recent form means the club is now well and truly on the rocks.",
      "And perhaps the most frustrating thing about this weekend's defeat is that it was so predictable. Three times since the turn of the year, United have gone into a season-defining game needing to deliver. Three times they have failed to do so.",
      "Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Skinner's side found themselves two goals down inside 23 minutes. Hayley Ladd clawed one back on the stroke of half-time before Lauren James' third of the day made sure of the victory for the hosts.",
      "Against Arsenal at the Emirates, United went into the break 3-0 down, with Lucia Garcia's stoppage-time goal proving to be little more than a consolation. That the Reds lost again by the same scoreline at the Etihad is a damning indictment of their ability to step up to the plate when the occasion demands it the most.",
      "Maybe the biggest compliment you could pay City on Saturday afternoon, is that they didn't have to play particularly well to get their noses in front. It was United who shaded the first half-hour of the contest before Jess Park's volley gave the hosts the advantage.",
      "It must be said that any consternation in United's ranks would have been justified, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "\"I actually felt we played well in large parts of the game,\" Skinner said. \"The first goal shouldn't even exist as a goal, she's offside. The difference between smaller and big stadiums is when there are more fans momentum swings quicker. The second and third goal we've got to be better for.\"",
      "Certainly, it's hard to refute the United manager's assertion that the goal changed the game. And, just eight minutes later, Park had made it two, deftly prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box.",
      "On that occasion, Skinner and his players only had themselves to blame. That Park - who has proved herself to be one of the most capable players in the league in recent months - was afforded so much time and space in the penalty area will surely be one of the biggest talking points when the Reds begin their post-match post-mortem at Carrington on Monday morning.",
      "So too will the fact that City were able to carve United open so easily just seconds into the second half, with Park turning provider this time as Shaw finished coolly past a dejected Mary Earps.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. But, as they did against Arsenal and Chelsea, the Reds had left it too late and were left to rue yet another missed opportunity to take their stuttering season off life support.",
      "Of course, there are some mitigating factors for this underwhelming campaign. Any team in world football would struggle to seamlessly replace the considerable talents of Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo, who left the club last summer for Barcelona and Arsenal respectively. Injuries have also played their part, with summer signings Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa both having endured lengthy spells on the sidelines.",
      "But ultimately, United have just simply not been good enough. Fingers will rightly be pointed at the manager but the players must also take accountability ahead of a summer that will be crucial in shaping the club's future.",
      "Certainly, if the rest of the season is to be viewed as an audition for a long-term place in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's United regime, then Skinner and his squad must now hope for a flawless end to the campaign. \"Pressure makes you stronger,\" the Reds boss said. \"This club will rise to the levels we all want. I’m a fighter so I’m going to put myself in a position where I can make this team the best in the land. That’s my personal responsibility.\"",
      "In many ways, Skinner's defiance is admirable and speaks to a manager who has never shied away from the added pressures that come with presiding over a United team. But, no matter how valiantly he is battling to secure his future at the club, it very much feels like he is currently losing the fight.",

      "When big-money summer signing, Jill Roord, ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) back in January, it was hard not to fear that the Blues' title charge might start to veer drastically off course. But Park, who joined City as a winger in 2017, is relishing her newfound responsibility in the no. 10 role and has inspired Gareth Taylor's side to huge wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and now United.",
      "For the lifelong City fan, who grew up aiming to follow in the footsteps of Sergio Aguero, it simply doesn't get much better than this; netting a brace against your arch-rivals to send your club - at least temporarily - top of the Women's Super League (WSL) table. Boyhood City fan Phil Foden did the same for men's side against United earlier in March, winning at the Etihad by the same scoreline - and now it was Park's turn.",
      "It is worth noting that it was only a few short months ago that United took to the pitch at Old Trafford two points better off than their city rivals, hoping to maintain their unbeaten start to their league campaign and truly assert themselves in the title race.",
      "Perhaps that afternoon, which ended with the visitors celebrating in front of the East Stand, was the turning point; the moment where the gulf in quality between the two sides first became apparent and the significant chasm that now separates them in the table first began to forge.",
      "Certainly, the landscape heading into this weekend’s showdown at the Etihad was very different. This time, it was advantage City, with the Blues bidding to end the day three points clear of the indomitable Chelsea ahead of their clash with West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, meanwhile, travelled to east Manchester as the would-be disrupters. A win at the home of their noisy neighbours would not quite abate the simmering frustration sparked by what has been a largely underwhelming season, but stopping City from winning a first WSL title since 2016 would at least go some way to tempering the supporters’ angst.",
      "Indeed, even Blues boss Taylor couldn’t find a way to diminish the magnitude of the contest for his side. “Every game is so important because the margin for error is really tight,\" he said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Any kind of dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. We don't underestimate any game. But I probably have to agree (that this is) one of the biggest derbies.\"",
      "And maybe it was the high stakes that contributed to City's subpar start on Saturday afternoon, with United enjoying the best of the early chances in M11. First it was Nikita Parris who came close, drawing a fine save from Khiara Keating, before Brazil international Geyse drilled an effort just wide of the post.",
      "City, though, are always dangerous, even when they are not at their best. And it was Park who fired the first warning shot, taking aim from 25 yards out and forcing Mary Earps to smother the ball to safety.",
      "United still had their moments, most notably when Lucia Garcia's deflected effort had to be tipped over the crossbar by Keating. But City grew in stature with every passing second and took the lead in the 37th minute when Leila Ouhabi teased the ball into the path of Park, who volleyed brilliantly past Earps.",
      "There may have been some justifiable consternation in the United ranks, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "And so it proved, as - just minutes after Shaw saw her strike correctly ruled out for offside - Park had made it two, prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box. The England international was given a heroes reception as she made her way down the tunnel at half-time, while Taylor turned to give a triumphant fist pump to the crowd.",
      "But the job was not done yet and it quickly became clear City had no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half, with Shaw finding the back of the net mere seconds after the restart. The Jamaican, who finished coolly after a perfectly-weighted through ball from Park, had managed to cement herself as City's top-scorer before the VIPs in the Colin Bell stand had even had the time to finish their half-time pies and return to their padded seats.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. However, while Marc Skinner's side enjoyed the lion's share of possession in the final quarter, City's defensive fortitude won out, ensuring the hosts won the day in front of a 40,086-strong crowd.",
      "\"It's always felt like (this could be our year),\" Taylor said when quizzed on the possibility of his side winning the title this term. \"When we started the season, our first game at West Ham was very good and you start to see things the team.",
      "\"Obviously there's a long way from that point to where we are now and full credit to the players and the group behind the group to get us to this position. It's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of trust. The most important thing now... is not to worry too much about anything else and control what we need to control.\"",
      "On Park, the City boss added: \"The cherry on the cake we've been looking for with Jess has been goals and assists and she gave us that today on a big stage. Her performance was good, with and without the ball she drives really well and gives us a lot of energy and a lot of quality.",
      "\"Jess has stepped into the opportunity really well. When you think about how patient she had to be, she's done really well.\"",
      "Certainly, Park will have been delighted to have seen England manager Sarina Wiegman in the stands to take in her exceptional display. With the European Championships to come next summer, the 22-year-old is surely edging ever closer to a starting spot in the Lionesses team. But, if City can carry this momentum into the final run-in, Park and her teammates might just be celebrating a different trophy in a couple of months' time.",

      "\"They have to win next weekend as the season will be over if they don't. Erik ten Hag has got to look at this season whereby he could finish his first two seasons with two trophies in the bank, one in each season. That should never be sniffed at.",
      "\"There's nothing left to say about some of the league performances we're seeing and some of the things we're watching, the tweets and the likes, we've said it so many times before.",
      "\"But what we can say is that Erik ten Hag's future is largely dependent on the FA Cup, as their performances in the league are gone. They are not going to change, now what we are seeing is how they will finish the season it seems like the players have switched off away from home at times.",
      "\"At home, they have to turn on as there's 75,000 people who won't allow them to get away with it. The Man Utd fans, they never stop away from home and they are watching some really dodgy stuff. They never turn against the team or manager and they have been dealt with some right guff. But the FA Cup is everything.\"",
      "United beat Liverpool in a thrilling FA Cup quarter-final before the March international break and Ten Hag said afterwards he believed it could be a turning point for his side.",
      "But since resuming action, United have failed to win a match and put in highly-criticised performances at Brentford and Bournemouth, as well as throwing away a lead to lose at Chelsea. There was a Premier League draw at home to Liverpool but their rivals' finishing let them off.",
      "Neville says that while the poor displays may have now become familiar to United supporters, Ten Hag cannot rely on injuries which have hit his squad as an excuse.",
      "\"There's nothing more to say we've seen it all before,\" said Neville about the team's recent form.",
      "\"It's a repeat of what's happened over the last six, seven, eight years with managers in their second or third seasons at Manchester United where there seems to be that breakdown at the end.",
      "\"The main thing is the performance levels and we've seen at Brentford, we've now seen at Bournemouth, they are really low performance levels which is a worry.",
      "\"I know people point towards the injuries and Manchester United have had a mountain of injuries but I said the same against Liverpool, nine of that team that started on Saturday would probably be in the starting XI if everyone was fit.",
      "\"[Andre] Onana, [Harry] Maguire, [Diogo] Dalot, Casemiro, [Kobbie] Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and [Rasmus] Hojlund, [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Marcus] Rashford.",
      "\"Those are nine players, who are Manchester United's best players in those positions. You bring in Luke Shaw and you bring in [Lisandro] Martinez and you can possibly argue between [Raphael] Varane and Maguire but there's nothing in it.",
      "\"They have had lots of injuries but at the moment there's no excuses for the levels of the performances we're seeing and every team has one or two players missing at certain points.",
      "\"There's no explanation for how they are playing. The anger, or disappointment has gone out of many Manchester United fans' voices. We've got to a point where the FA Cup is a big thing.",
      "\"You've always said winning a trophy a season is a real achievement. But it is a bizarre experience watching Man Utd, how bad they can be in games.\""

      "Sunday 14 April 2024 12:31, UK",
      "Erik Ten Hag admitted Man Utd \"didn't deserve more\" than their 2-2 draw at Bournemouth as Andoni Iraola bemoaned refereeing decisions against his side - including two penalty calls.",
      "Man Utd twice came from behind to earn a point at the Vitality Stadium but were second best for much of the contest.",
      "Defensive errors and sloppy play, particularly in the first half, allowed Bournemouth to dominate. But two goals from Bruno Fernandes - the second after a harsh penalty against Adam Smith - saw the visitors take a point back to Manchester.",
      "\"We are into the final stage of the season and this is not enough. But the truth is today, we didn't deserve more,\" Ten Hag told Sky Sports after the game.",
      "\"In the end, if you allow them so many chances in the first half, as a team you don't deserve more. You have to take control, don't give chances and score goals for yourself.",
      "\"It's up to them... In this moment, with all the problems we have, we played to our levels and did very good to our levels.",
      "\"But you have to do it throughout the game, right until stoppage-time, and the last four games we dropped points from winning positions. Today, we were in losing positions and fought back.",
      "\"But coming into losing positions is totally unnecessary. We lost the ball three times in the areas where we should not lose those balls. They [United's players] were not always well-organised, especially on the right side where there came some gaps for the opposition to benefit from it. We should have done this better.",
      "\"Second half, we took more responsibility and we closed that side... [There were] individual mistakes, we have players who can do better with the ball. On the right side, go with your opponent, that is your job, close it. It's a small part in it, it's about collaboration, but the main part is discipline.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp on Saturday Night Football:",
      "\"Fernandes has got a lot of stick from people and some of it I get. But I also think it's unfair.",
      "\"I see a player that genuinely cares. Sometimes, there is pettiness and calling out his players, but he is the sort of player you'd be looking to build the team around. He's a player, he makes things happen.",
      "\"Where the frustration comes from is that people don't care as much as he does. It's like an epidemic at the club. Do people care? Do they do enough? Do they go flying into tackles?",
      "\"Fernandes does and sometimes gets himself into situations he shouldn't. But he cares about the club, the team, he's got his team back into the game today.",
      "\"I don't see too many others right now showing the appetite he does. I see multiple Champions League winners walking around the pitch sometimes like they don't care, and you can't have that.",
      "\"I've watched Casemiro for years and he's one of my favourite defensive midfield players in football, I've loved watching him play.",
      "\"But right now, it looks like he's in Soccer Aid. He's playing the game at such a pace where it's a bit of fun and there's celebrities coming on - no, this is the Premier League.",
      "\"I think to myself 'what would Rodri do?' and he'd be flying to help his team-mates. And that's what he should be doing.",
      "\"At the moment, Casemiro is not setting the right examples to the young players around him. It isn't good enough.\"",
      "Bournemouth boss Iraola believes his side deserved all three points from a game they largely dominated - but added refereeing decisions were not kind to them.",
      "He told Sky Sports: \"We cannot finish and be happy with the point. You always have to give importance to a point against Man Utd, but I think we were the team who deserved the three points.",
      "\"We missed the chances especially in the first half and I think we could have gone in at half-time with a better result, but also in the second half.",
      "\"But the reason we didn't win was because we missed the chances and all the refereeing decisions went against us.\"",
      "Christie penalty overturned by VAR",
      "Late in added time, Ryan Christie was fouled by Willy Kambwala, with referee Tony Harrington pointing to the spot. However, a VAR review decided the foul took place outside the area.",
      "Iraola said of the incident: \"Completely [a penalty], because if you saw the penalty we conceded against Newcastle, we started pulling two metres outside the box, he goes inside and it's a penalty.",
      "\"If you put it in one frame, he's probably one centimetre outside the box. But he continues stopping the player one or two metres inside. It's not just one kick and then boom [it's a foul]. He goes with Ryan Christie one or two metres inside the box. For me, it's obvious.\"",
      "According to The FA’s Laws of the Game (Law 12.3):\n\n\n\"If a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Redknapp added: \"I think once Kambwala steps out, it's almost irrelevant because once you're holding him, you're stopping him running into the box and that's where I thought this wasn't going to get overturned.",
      "\"It's like a rugby tackle, he uses his arm… he's just got to run him down the side.",
      "\"I was amazed it got overturned. I get that it's outside the box, but it's the fact he was travelling into the box which is why I think it should have been given.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Izzy Christensen said: \"I thought that [contact outside the box] initially and I stand by that.",
      "\"There's contact, of course there is. Kambwala has had to step and he's stepped at exactly the right time that it's not in the box. Six inches deeper and it's a stonewall penalty. Christie is clever in the way he nicks the ball past Kambwala.",
      "\"Because he [Kambwala] is square and Christie runs into him, you have to wonder what he can do, he's going to hit him as he runs into him.\"",
      "Smith penalised for handball",
      "Man Utd equalised for a second time after the break as Smith was penalised for handball. A shot from Kobbie Mainoo hit Christie before deflecting onto Smith.",
      "While Iraola said that \"normally they don't call these kinds of handballs\", both Redknapp and Christensen believed it was a penalty, pointing to Rashford's positioning.",
      "Christensen said: \"The way that it evolved was very unfortunate for Adam Smith - and the way the deflection takes place.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has a key part to play in this because of his position. Rashford is lurking and Smith knows that.",
      "\"Smith moves his body towards the ball and his reaction says it all. He knows he's moved his arms slightly towards the ball as he's adjusted his body.",
      "\"It's harsh - but for me, it's a penalty.\"",
      "Redknapp added: \"It's a twitch. That's how things react sometimes. Of course we don't want to see these given but in the current climate with the way football has moved with handball, I've seen a lot worse given.",
      "\"You can see there's the slightest movement from Adam to put his right arm out. If Marcus isn't behind him, he finds his way out, let's the ball run across his body and clips it up the line.",
      "\"It felt like a slight panic and slight movement and that's all it took. It was never going to be overturned.\""

      "Match report as Manchester United Women set up FA Cup final showdown against Tottenham after goals from  Lucia Garcia and Rachel Williams seal surprise victory over Chelsea; Emma Hayes' side reduced deficit on stroke of half time through Lauren James",
      "Monday 15 April 2024 09:54, UK",
      "Manchester United advanced to an FA Cup final against Tottenham after holding out for a historic 2-1 victory over holders Chelsea at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "In a rematch of last year's final, which they lost 1-0, Marc Skinner's United went in front in the first minute through a Lucia Garcia header before doubling the advantage midway through the first half when Rachel Williams headed home.",
      "Former United player Lauren James pulled a goal back just prior to the break and the visitors did most of the attacking thereafter but were unable to force extra-time, with Mary Earps making a superb save to thwart James and substitute Catarina Macario hitting the bar.",
      "The result is a first victory for United over Chelsea since the team's launch in 2018 - and they now have a chance to secure a maiden piece of major silverware when they return to Wembley on May 12 to face Spurs, who beat Leicester in the other semi-final earlier on Sunday.",
      "Chelsea, meanwhile, saw a trophy bid end for the second successive game, having lost 1-0 to Arsenal in the League Cup final last time out.",
      "They remain in the hunt for the Women's Super League - currently topping a table in which United lie fourth - and the Champions League, with a semi-final first leg in Barcelona to come next Saturday, as they seek glory in their final few games before boss Emma Hayes departs to take charge of the United States.",
      "United made a dream start as they grabbed the lead in the opening few seconds, Chelsea full-back Eve Perisset being punished for losing possession with Leah Galton claiming the ball on the left and delivering a cross to far post, where Garcia headed in.",
      "And after unsuccessful attempts at the other end from James and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, the hosts then extended their advantage via another header teed up from the left, Ella Toone this time providing the delivery and veteran forward Williams, brought into the starting XI for Nikita Parris, nodding past Hannah Hampton.",
      "Williams had the chance to make it 3-0 soon after but could not get her shot on target, before James fired into the side-netting.",
      "Chelsea subsequently exerted further pressure as the interval drew near, and following a header from Mayra Ramirez going wide and Earps doing well to turn one from James around the post, the latter halved the deficit as she fired in from Niamh Charles' cutback.",
      "Earps - who was dropped to the bench for England's win over the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday, with Hampton playing in her place - then pulled off an even better save to keep out another James header six minutes into the second half.",
      "As Chelsea continued to hunt a leveller, Rytting Kaneryd's claims for a penalty were dismissed after she struck the ball against Katie Zelem, and Earps was in action again to deny Erin Cuthbert and James.",
      "The verdict was no penalty again after a Williams collision with Charles, and Chelsea were then inches away from equalising as Macario's curling corner connected with the bar.",
      "Stoppage-time saw a Parris strike saved by Hampton and fellow substitute Aggie Beever-Jones shoot into the side-netting as Skinner's team sealed a ground-breaking triumph.",
      "Man Utd goalkeeper Mary Earps told BBC:",
      "\"It feels so good, this season has been so hard. It's been mentally brutal but I'm so glad. We're in the final and it's one more game to go. Let's go.",
      "\"We're been lacking aggression in our games this season and we gave this one a real go. It's heavy when things don't go your way in the league and it's been difficult.",
      "\"It was ugly, it was horrible, but we don't care as we won. It was really gritty and it just means so much.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Marc Skinner told BBC:",
      "\"We said all week that we were going to have to suffer. Chelsea have an abundance of talent in every position and they can bring more on. So we knew we would suffer.",
      "\"Tooney said to me in the first half, 'Mark I'm doing dog ears,' and I said 'Yes, we need to,' it is part of these types of games. To beat a Chelsea team like this you have got to dig in. Every player played their part, from the starting XI to the players that came on, the magnificent fans, everyone did their bit.",
      "\"As a coach these are the real moments that make it worthwhile. When you feel the collective energy of a team like Manchester United it makes you feel alive. These players performed alive today and that is why we won the game.\"",
      "Chelsea boss Emma Hayes told BBC:",
      "\"You can't defend as a team like that and expect a maximum result. It changes the course of the game. A mistake in the first minute doesn't help a side. These things happen in football.",
      "\"We dominated the ball and the attacks. We get a goal at half-time. Back in the game, Mary Earps produces a couple of world class saves and it was our turn to be on the receiving end of not getting the big refereeing decisions today.",
      "On going out of the FA Cup: \"I'm grateful for everything. I've been unbeaten in four years, that's an unbelievable record. As always I'm reflective on what I need to do. Congratulations to Manchester United. Their fans but in a great shift for them and as a team they performed at a good level and just congrats to them.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes twice hauled Manchester United level at Bournemouth as Erik ten Hag's side grabbed a barely-deserved 2-2 draw that further decreases their Champions League hopes.",
      "United had conceded at least 28 shots in their last three matches and, while they weren't quite as open at the Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth will no doubt regret missing the opportunity to complete a Premier League double over their visitors.",
      "The Cherries were the better side throughout the first half and led when Dominic Solanke punished Willy Kambwala's slip to fire the hosts ahead, only for Fernandes to slam in a volley from short range against the run of play.",
      "Bournemouth restored their advantage when Justin Kluivert capitalised on more questionable United defending but United were level again when Fernandes rolled in a penalty after Adam Smith was penalised for an unfortunate handball.",
      "Bournemouth then saw a stoppage-time penalty for a foul on Ryan Christie by Kambwala overturned, with replays showing the offence occurred just outside the area - although the contact continued into the box.",
      "According to IFAB's laws of the game, \"if a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.\"",
      "It was another fortunate break for United, who ended the game with an expected-goals-from-open-play total of just 0.39 and conceded 20 shots.",
      "The point leaves them seventh - 10 points off the Champions League places with just six matches left to play.",

      "After injuries to Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans forced him into action, Kambwala earned praise for his performance in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool - despite United facing 28 shots on goal.",
      "But in just his third Premier League start, the 19-year-old endured a chastening evening, which began when he was outmuscled by Solanke before losing his footing as the striker powered a confident finish beyond Andre Onana.",
      "In truth, it was Alejandro Garnacho who deserved most of the blame after gifting possession to Bournemouth. The winger was replaced at half-time and may be facing an awkward conversation with Ten Hag after liking social media posts criticising the substitution. He later unliked the posts.",
      "Bournemouth came close to doubling their lead through Milos Kerkez and Luis Sinisterra, before Fernandes' volley levelled the scores.",
      "But Kambwala was in the spotlight for Bournemouth's second just four minutes later, leaving far too much space between himself and Diogo Dalot, into which Kluivert sprang before drilling a finish inside Onana's near post.",
      "There was still time in the first half for Kerkez to miss two huge chances - with United's defenders simply standing and watching - and for Onana to deny an unmarked Kluivert.",
      "Fernandes - who clipped the bar in first-half stoppage-time - remained United's only threat and took the chance to score his second when Kobbie Mainoo's deflected shot inadvertently caught Smith's arm.",
      "United deserve credit for restricting Bournemouth's threat in the second half - but it looked like that work had been undone when Kambwala obstructed Christie deep into stoppage time.",
      "But referee Tony Harrington - who also experienced a tough afternoon - was advised to overturn the decision. The official followed that advice without going to the monitor, and Enes Unal failed to hit the target from the resulting free-kick.",
      "According to The FA’s Laws of the Game (Law 12.3):\n<br>\n<br>\n“If a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.”",
      "United may have held onto a point but they are now winless in four matches and have conceded nine goals in the process - not an ideal demonstration of Ten Hag's merits as Sir Jim Ratcliffe assesses the best way forward at Old Trafford.",
      "Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola was furious at referee Tony Harrington's performance, saying \"all the decisions\" went against his side.",
      "\"We cannot be happy with the point,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We were the team that deserved three points.",
      "\"We missed chances, especially in the first half. But the reason we didn’t win is because we missed the chances and all the refereeing decisions went against us.\"",
      "Iraola was disappointed with the decision to punish Smith for his inadvertent handball, saying: \"It comes from his own team-mate and it’s instinctive. Normally they don’t call these kind of handballs.\"",
      "The Cherries boss was even more frustrated with the decision by Jarred Gillett, the VAR, to advise Harrington to overturn his decision to award Bournemouth a late penalty, explaining: \"The first frame, he is maybe one centimetre outside the box but he continues stopping the player one or two metres inside. It’s obvious.\"",
      "Iraola also questioned why Christie was booked for diving after Diogo Dalot made contact with him in the second half, whereas Kobbie Mainoo was not penalised for simulation earlier in the game.",
      "\"In the first half, Kobbie Mainoo dives and it is not a yellow card,\" said Iraola. \"In the second half, there is contact on Christie and it is a yellow card for diving. What’s the reason?",
      "\"We need the same respect as other teams. All the teams are playing for important things and it’s cost us a lot of hard work.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Joe Shread:",
      "It's hard not to feel sympathy for Andoni Iraola. While referee Tony Harrington made several questionable calls, it was unfortunate for Bournemouth that most of those decisions did not go their way.",
      "While Willy Kambwala's foul on Ryan Christie in stoppage-time began outside the area, he clearly brought the Cherries midfielder down inside the area.",
      "IFAB's laws state that, if a foul continues into the box, a penalty should be given. It was curious that VAR Jarred Gillett did not even recommend Harrington reviewed the decision at the monitor - he simply advised him to change his mind.",
      "Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the penalty Adam Smith conceded is that Harrington technically made the correct decision. IFAB says that a handball occurs when a player “touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger.”",
      "Smith had no intention of making contact with Kobbie Mainoo’s shot after it deflected in his direction, but his arm was extended away from his body.",
      "However, Iraola is right to say those kind of handballs are often not given in the Premier League. And just because the laws as they are currently written say it should be a penalty, it doesn’t mean that is right, or even that it is good for the game.",
      "Should a player accidentally brushing the ball with their arm while minding their own business on the edge of the area really result in a nearly 80 per cent chance of scoring?",
      "The handball law remains broken - and Bournemouth suffered because of it.",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag admitted his side did not deserve to beat Bournemouth and criticised his players' first-half performance.",

      "Plus: Anthony Gordon shows his class; Jeremy Doku shines in emphatic Manchester City win; Nottingham Forest demonstrate relegation fight after battling Wolves draw",
      "Saturday 13 April 2024 21:58, UK",
      "Anthony Gordon was instrumental in Newcastle's 4-0 win over Tottenham at St James' Park. It was his strength when pressing that sparked the shift in momentum in the build-up to the opening goal. Destiny Udogie had the weight advantage but was still outmuscled.",
      "Gordon picked out Alexander Isak with the pass, scored the second himself within two minutes and even provided the cross for Fabian Schar to make it four late on. An emphatic win and an emphatic performance from the former Everton winger.",
      "This was the first time that he has been involved in three goals in a single Premier League game and he now has more goal involvements than anyone in home matches this season. It should be enough for Gareth Southgate to take him away to Germany this summer.",
      "But this Newcastle win owed as much to Eddie Howe's tactics as any individual performer. It was impressive how he was able to nullify Tottenham's build-up play through their inverted full-backs, even changing his own team's defensive shape to do exactly that.",
      "\"Tottenham are unique in what they do and we felt we needed to change to give ourselves the best chance of what we wanted to do. I thought tactically it worked, it was a really good delivery from the players, they always deserve the praise for the execution.\"",
      "Those players, Gordon among them, will receive praise following such a stunning result. But this was a big day for Howe too, his tactical acumen winning the day.Adam Bate",
      "Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou said ahead of his side's clash with Newcastle that there was \"no reason\" for him to watch last season's 6-1 defeat at St James' Park.",
      "In hindsight, maybe he wishes he had.",
      "The heavy defeat back in April - Newcastle were 5-0 up after 21 minutes - proved to be the end of Spurs bid to qualify for the Champions League last season, and the big defeat this time around could prove just as damaging to their hopes this year.",
      "Spurs were second best in every department against Newcastle as Eddie Howe tactically outthought Postecoglou. The switch to a back five worked wonders for the hosts, who countered at will against a lacklustre Spurs.",
      "The 4-0 scoreline sees Postecoglou's side drop to fifth on goal difference, with Aston Villa, who face Arsenal live on Sky Sports on Super Sunday, moving up a place to fourth without kicking a ball. And with England's hopes of pipping Germany in the race for an extra Champions League spot set to go down to the wire, Spurs Champions League qualification hopes remain firmly in the balance.",
      "It doesn't get any easier for Spurs. They now have to stew until April 28 when they face north London rivals Arsenal, live on Sky Sports before games against Chelsea and Liverpool.Oliver Yew",
      "Each of Tottenham’s last three Premier League defeats by 4-plus goals have come against Newcastle at St James’ Park – also 1-5 in May 2016 and 1-6 in April 2023. Indeed, they’ve now lost by 4-plus goals against Newcastle more often than they have vs any other opponent in Premier League history (five).\n\n\nSpurs have now conceded 61 Premier League goals against Newcastle at St James’ Park, only conceding more at one away venue in the competition (64 at Anfield).\n\n\nNewcastle have scored 93 Premier League goals against Tottenham, more than they have against any other opponent in the competition. Meanwhile, today was their first home clean sheet against Spurs in 18 home league games, since a 4-0 win in December 2003.",
      "For once, even Erik ten Hag didn't try too hard to defend Manchester United's performance.",

      "But after United allowed another 20 shots against Bournemouth, Ten Hag criticised his side for their sloppiness in possession, as well as failing to carry out their jobs in defending their right flank.",

      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe ready to oversee his first off-season at Old Trafford, Ten Hag is running out of time to suggest he should be part of United's new era.Joe Shread",
      "It's hard not to feel sympathy for Andoni Iraola. While referee Tony Harrington made several questionable calls, it was unfortunate for Bournemouth that most of those decisions did not go their way in their 2-2 draw with Manchester United.",
      "While Willy Kambwala's foul on Ryan Christie in stoppage-time began outside the area, he clearly brought the Cherries midfielder down inside the area.",
      "IFAB's laws state that, if a foul continues into the box, a penalty should be given. It was curious that VAR Jarred Gillett did not even recommend Harrington reviewed the decision at the monitor - he simply advised him to change his mind.",
      "Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the penalty Adam Smith conceded is that Harrington technically made the correct decision. IFAB says that a handball occurs when a player \"touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger.\"",
      "Smith had no intention of making contact with Kobbie Mainoo's shot after it deflected in his direction, but his arm was extended away from his body.",
      "However, Iraola is right to say those kind of handballs are often not given in the Premier League. And just because the laws as they are currently written say it should be a penalty, it doesn't mean that is right, or even that it is good for the game.",
      "Should a player accidentally brushing the ball with their arm while minding their own business on the edge of the area really result in a nearly 80 per cent chance of scoring?",
      "The handball law remains broken - and Bournemouth suffered because of it.Joe Shread",
      "It felt like Jeremy Doku was everywhere for Manchester City. Doku here. Doku there.",
      "City did do a lot of attacking against Luton - as the 393 passes in the final third proves. And Doku was at the heart of the constant pressure towards Thomas Kaminski's goal. He recorded 23 touches in the Luton box - that's the most of any player in any game this season. Two of those actions led to a goal.",
      "First when dancing past Fred Onyedinma, whose tired legs could no longer resist the urge to have a nibble, and Erling Haaland stroked home the penalty. Doku then grabbed the goal his exhibition of dribbling deserved with a masterful solo effort.",
      "Pep Guardiola had described the Belgian as shy during the early stages of his Manchester City career. He's now craving attention - and defenders don't know how to deal with his direct and dazzling feet.Lewis Jones",
      "Before Burnley's game with Brighton, assistant manager Craig Bellamy vowed his side would continue their way of playing and not change their methods in the face of relegation. Come full-time, he may be rueing those words.",
      "Burnley, with their possession-based style of play despite having an inferior-quality playing squad compared to most, have been too nice this season in terms of their lack of ruthlessness and easiness to play against.",
      "But then there was hope. Josh Brownhill's opener against Brighton briefly put them four points away from safety with a big game away at Sheffield United to come next week. Survival was still improbable but the great escape was very much on.",
      "Then came Muric's mistake - a costly lack of concentration from a safe back-pass - and that hope was gone.",
      "While it was a costly individual error, Burnley's way of playing was partly to blame - Muric made 94 touches against Brighton, the most by a Premier League goalkeeper in the last eight seasons.",
      "Yes, Muric should do a lot better in the moment, but trying to play out the back with 10 minutes to go in a must-win game is part of the process at Turf Moor - when it shouldn't be.",
      "This lack of streetwise attitude is why Burnley are likely to be in the Championship next season.Sam Blitz",
      "I Am Maximus romped to victory in the Grand National, and while Brentford would eventually win here at a canter, they did so without their own gladiator. Ivan Toney remained in the stable, an unused substitute.",
      "Having only been called upon against Aston Villa last weekend after Ollie Watkins' late equaliser, you begin to wonder just how much more will we see of Toney in a red and white shirt.",
      "Injured or not, Thomas Frank knows he has to start preparing his players for life without their talisman. Frank's attack was still not quite at full throttle, but here they still carried more than enough potency to extend Sheffield United's abysmal away record.",
      "The Blades, still without a clean sheet on the road, were unable to capitalise on Toney's absence.",
      "The striker is on his lengthiest Premier League goal drought, having amassed 21 shots and 36 touches in the opposition box during seven consecutive starts prior to his omission at Villa Park.",
      "\"Ivan Toney was ill during the week, and his hip injury is still not perfect,\" Frank said afterwards. \"Now we have time to get him ready for Luton and I'm convinced he will be ready.\"",
      "No Toney, no problem for Brentford? Not quite, but if he is to be sold as expected this summer, the return of Kevin Schade to fitness alongside Bryan Mbeumo means it would be smart management to use him sparingly in the remaining games - regardless of his fitness.Ben Grounds",
      "How Wolves have missed Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian was injured early on against Brentford in February, having scored twice in the win over Chelsea in the previous match. He delivered another two goals on his return to the starting line-up at Nottingham Forest.",
      "The first of those goals was a fine example of what he brings that others cannot. A powerful run from deep, a smart turn to elude the defender and an emphatic finish. His second was an atypical poacher's effort to take his Premier League total for the season to 11.",
      "It was not enough to win the game for Wolves. Cunha was withdrawn with the game in the balance, a nod to the fact that he is still ahead of schedule - the initial prognosis for his muscle injury was that he should still be on the treatment table, not the pitch.",
      "Gary O'Neil may still be wondering what might have been had he felt able to call upon Cunha for the FA Cup quarter-final against Coventry when teenager Nathan Fraser was asked to lead the line instead. With Cunha back, Wolves are always able to pose a threat.Adam Bate",
      "Grudge and grievance bubbled beneath the surface. How Nottingham Forest would have loved to get the better of their Midlands neighbours in league competition for the first time since 2018.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White taunted the Wolves fans that used to applaud him after scoring his fifth league goal of the campaign. Had Forest gone on to win the game, clawing themselves three points clear of the drop zone, the entire episode would have been justified.",
      "But goading his former employers was perhaps a little ill-advised given what actually transpired five minutes later - a Matheus Cunha equaliser. Gibbs-White does, however, remain key to Forests' survival hopes and their future is crucially in their own hands.",
      "The importance placed on upcoming games against Everton, Sheffield United and Burnley is increasing by the week. Five games to rescue a season.",
      "Forest have fight, that's for sure. But do they have enough quality, consistency and nerve to stand up in games against direct relegation rivals, with the consequences so grave? Not so sure.Laura Hunter",

      "Man Utd goalkeeper Andre Onana on his tough start at Old Trafford: \"You have to be strong. You have to survive, use your opportunity, use your moment, and start to shine again\"; Watch Bournemouth vs Man Utd on Sky Sports Premier League from 5pm on Saturday, kick-off 5.30pm",
      "Saturday 13 April 2024 17:51, UK",
      "During the savage criticism that coloured the first six months of his Manchester United career, Andre Onana's head never dropped, his spirit remained unbroken.",
      "The goalkeeper refused to hide and insisted on taking responsibility.",
      "He wanted to front up every error, and admit he was not yet operating to his own standards, rather than having his team-mates or Erik ten Hag explain that on his behalf.",
      "Bruno Fernandes felt Onana was shouldering too much of the blame for what was ultimately collective failings, and as captain, stepped in to stop him from becoming a shield.",
      "The team wanted to protect the Cameroon international, but he was refusing to allow some bad moments to reframe his entire journey.",
      "Onana left his village in Mefou-et-Akono at 10, moving four hours away to join the Samuel Eto'o Academy. At 14, he was exposed to a new continent, language, culture, and way of life in Barcelona. He'd have to adjust again aged 18 when Ajax signed him.",
      "Onana became an international at 20, a Europa League finalist the following year, and a Champions League semi-finalist aged 23.",
      "At 24, he fought a doping ban which still robbed him of football for nine months - despite the Court of Arbitration for Sport finding \"no significant fault\" against him.",
      "Onana hurdled that with poise, delivering the Supercoppa and Coppa Italia for Inter, whom he helped steer to last year's Champions League final against victors Manchester City.",
      "The struggles, sacrifices, and successes since his formative years have offered a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"In life, everything is temporary and so you have to find a good balance,\" Onana tells Sky Sports ahead of United's Saturday Night Football clash with Bournemouth.",
      "\"Not too high, not too low… I knew six months before, I was seen as the best. Then it can be that in six months, everything changes and you just have to deal with the situation.\"",
      "Staff at Carrington who would ordinarily be concerned by a new player making mistakes and being met with widespread abuse, were instead marvelling at Onana's strength of character.",
      "The 28-year-old has been described as \"the biggest positive influence at the club,\" but his humility sees him redirect the compliment to the goalkeeping department.",
      "\"We are in this together,\" Onana, United's reigning player of the month, says. \"I want to thank Tom [Heaton], Altay [Bayındır], Richard [Hartis] and Craig [Mawson]. It's been a difficult time, a difficult situation, a difficult start for me.",
      "\"We have to protect each other, especially when things are not going good.",
      "\"They were there with me. They told me, 'Andre, listen, we know who you are. We were sitting in front of the TV, we were watching you playing the Champions League semi-final. You were almost close to winning against City in the final.",
      "\"'So we all know who you are. Take your time. Most of the keepers who have been here at Manchester United had difficulty in the beginning.'",
      "\"These are the kind of messages they were giving me, and the players also helped me so much.\"",
      "Onana didn't mind the scathing takes in the final months of 2023. \"Critics are a part of life, especially when you reach this kind of level,\" he shrugs.",
      "\"And especially being United goalkeeper after coming from Inter as the best. When you are new at a club, the expectation is high. If you're lucky to have a good start, everything is quite easy.",
      "\"When you don't have a good start, you have to be strong. You have to survive, use your opportunity, use your moment, and start to shine again.\"",
      "It's simple maths to calculate why Onana is so beloved at Carrington. He is a measured thinker and exudes a natural warmth in his interactions.",
      "His fluency in Spanish, French, English, Italian and his understanding of Dutch marks him the 'golden thread' of the dressing room.",
      "Onana has been a sounding board for the youngsters around the first team, and has particularly shepherded 19-year-old Willy Kambwala.",
      "He has also been a saving grace for United in recent months, as they stacked the unwelcome status of having conceded the most shots of any team in Europe's top-five leagues.",
      "\"If this year is a price to pay, I'm ready,\" Onana says, circling the club's defensive injury crisis which has prompted them into a low-block approach that invites pressure.",
      "\"Last season, Manchester United didn't concede so many shots. But I don't think it's a big issue because at the end of the day, football is about goals and now we are scoring a lot. We'll receive some against us sometimes, but we have defenders that work hard and we will do everything to block the shots.",
      "\"It's the risk we take because we are a very offensive team with the quality we have in front.\"",
      "Injuries have forced United into 31 different combinations at the back this season, which surely impacts a goalkeeper's consistency?",
      "\"Well, it's quite easy when you're used to playing with the same back four,\" Onana concedes but adds: \"We are Manchester United, so every player around the first team has the level to belong here.",
      "\"Unfortunately we have a lot of injuries but that is an opportunity for others - like Willy, he was brilliant for us.",
      "\"Being a goalkeeper is a position with a lot of responsibility. You have to be ready to play with anyone and… I can't complain. Of course, when you are used to playing with the same line, it's the best, but at the moment we don't have that.",
      "\"So we just have to deal with the situation, stay positive and look forward.\"",
      "Onana strays into Roy Keane territory, labelling the sea of shots he has to deal with as \"just doing my job, it's why they brought me here,\" but he talks about \"being more dominant with the ball\" and assisting the attack.",
      "Was the long kick out to Bruno for Marcus Rashford's beauty in the Manchester derby a prime example?",
      "\"Yes, one example, but not only that,\" Onana says. \"It's also to give more confidence to the players, let them know I'm the spare man and when we have the ball, I'm the one who has to find the free men.",
      "\"When you play against big teams, sometimes they go one against one, sometimes you have pressing from the No.10… so you have to recognise these kinds of situations and you have to make a decision. I'm here to take that responsibility and give confidence to my players.\"",
      "Onana declines to pick out a game for United which has showcased his best attributes because he doesn't feel he has reached full stride yet. He does have a favourite experience though: the FA Cup quarter-final victory over Liverpool at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was crazy,\" he puffs. \"I was in shock. It was just beautiful to be there. The noise, it was so loud. The joy… wow!\"",
      "Onana wants that feeling to be the norm for United fans, and he'd like Ten Hag to be the man who delivers it.",
      "\"Football doesn't have a memory,\" he says. \"You deliver good today and yesterday, tomorrow you don't deliver good and they are always going to remember what you did last. And unfortunately, you can't change that.",
      "\"Erik is a very good manager. I'm not here to back him because he's already big enough to back himself. He did great things for United last season. But this is football and I always say football is temporary. It is about moments, we have to know how to deal with the bad period because what we are facing this season in terms of injuries, I never saw that in my life…",
      "\"You know, we have more than 35 injuries. It's not an excuse, especially being a United player, but these are the things you have to deal with. You cannot hide. That is reality.",
      "\"We are doing everything to turn the situation. And it will turn, I'm sure a hundred percent.\""

      "\"Don't judge us now, we have to fight to the end,\" he told me ahead of this weekend's game with Bournemouth. \"Play every game with the right attitude. We have had a lot of setbacks, but every game is a new opportunity and that's how the approach should be. You have to get on with it.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has talked openly about how good European coaches have found life difficult at Manchester United. Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho to name two.",
      "Van Gaal lost his job almost as soon as the final whistle was blown at Wembley in 2016. Manchester United had just beaten Crystal Palace in the FA Cup Final.",
      "I was on interview duty at the time watching the chaos swirl around the tunnel area in front of my very own eyes. I remember him carrying the cup in one hand garlanded with its winning red ribbons as he celebrated on the pitch.",
      "His smile betrayed what was about to unravel in the corridors of the national stadium as rumours of his impending departure spread like wildfire.",
      "Even if Ten Hag delivers FA Cup success this season there are no guarantees he will be given the opportunity to go again. For now, he trusts the process and has all the energy he needs to continue.",
      "He opined: \"I'm a positive human being. The sun is always shining. Maybe it's behind the cloud at the moment but when I wake up in the morning it's a new day",
      "\"I get on with it. I want to enjoy every day. If you can do the most of what you like, working and co-operating with young people to bring them to their maximum levels, that's the best you can do.",
      "\"They have told me the direction. I feel very positive about this. You feel the energy coming in, I understand the structures they want to bring which will help and support us to get better results.\""

      "Alexander Isak, see me in my office.",
      "The Newcastle striker's failure to score for Newcastle at Fulham meant both bets last weekend went into the Sky Bet satchels.",
      "All eggs were in his basket and it proved a foolish move on my part. The both teams to score and over 2.5 goals in Tottenham and Nottingham Forest landed - as did Axel Disasi to make a foul vs Sheffield United but no Isak, no party in terms of the 13/2 treble. His failure to trouble the scorers also meant the Isak to score twice punt at 10/1 went tumbling into the abyss. Two points lost. And lessons learned, you'd assume.",
      "Or not.",
      "I'm keeping the faith with Isak. Time to repay that faith, Alexander.",
      "This bet lands if Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool score six or more first-half goals between them this weekend against teams they are 1/12, 1/5 and 1/5 to win this weekend.",
      "This bet gets me excited for many reasons. Not only is it a great one from an entertainment perspective as it will have some sort of chance of landing heading into the Arsenal game at 4.30pm on Sunday, but we're also playing a line that looks very attractive to me. All three teams are in a busy spell with big European matches on the horizon in midweek, especially Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "I think there's a strong chance of both managers wanting their side to rack up a comfortable lead in the first 45 minutes against Aston Villa and Luton to save some legs for midweek. It could lead to dull second halves, like Arsenal produced in their 2-0 win over Luton recently. And Liverpool will surely be in reaction mode after what happened on Thursday night. Crystal Palace could feel that force in the first half.",
      "Isak's price just can't be ignored again in Newcastle's clash with Tottenham where goals look almost guaranteed.",
      "Spurs (81%) and Newcastle (71%) sit first and third when it comes to percentage of their Premier League games going over 2.5 goals so a goals-based bet has to be considered. Isak is that play.",
      "He's scored 10 goals in his last 14 appearances and Isak's goals per 90 rate is the fourth best of any player in the Premier League at 0.70. In a goal-heavy game, he can get in on the act.",
      "We're dealing with two of the worst attacks in the Premier League since December when Burnley and Brighton met. If you take out matches against Sheffield United since December, Burnley have scored 17 goals in 18 matches - 0.94 goals per game whilst if you remove Sheffield United from the equation again, Brighton have scored just 13 goals in their last 15 games across all competitions. Under 2.5 has to be the play at the prices.",
      "Any opportunity we get to back both teams to score around Evens should be gobbled up this season in the Premier League. It's a bet that has landed in 62.9 per cent of games - a huge increase on the average from the last five seasons of 50.66 as the goal rush in this league continues to flow at never-before-seen levels.",
      "Well, the price for it to land in Liverpool vs Crystal Palace is 5/6 and it looks a confident selection to hopefully bring home the treble on Super Sunday.",
