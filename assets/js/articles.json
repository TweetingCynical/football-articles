      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery insists he still has complete faith in Jadon Sancho's abilities and is committed to unlocking the winger's potential during the remainder of the campaign. The 25-year-old, who is on loan from Manchester United and will therefore be unavailable to face his parent club this weekend, has yet to make a Premier League start under Emery and hasn't found the net since arriving at Villa on deadline day.",
      "Sancho has, however, featured from the off in Villa's last four Europa League matches, though he is still awaiting his first assist for the club.",
      "Sancho has demonstrated glimpses of his talent when coming off the bench, particularly against Arsenal a fortnight ago, when he kept possession alive in the build-up to Emi Buendía's late winner.",
      "With the January transfer window looming, there has been talk that Villa might look to create room in their squad by terminating Sancho's loan early. However, Emery made his position on the winger crystal clear during his pre-United press conference.",
      "\"Jadon is still being young. He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance,\" the Villa boss said. \"I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us.",
      "\"Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea.",
      "\"He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it.\"",
      "Villa are heading into their showdown with United on a winning streak, having triumphed in 15 of their last 17 matches, including nine straight victories, six of which were in the league - setting a new club record.",
      "However, United have historically held the upper hand against Villa, securing 41 Premier League victories against them, 18 of those away from home. Only the Red Devils themselves have defeated a single opponent more frequently, both overall and away, with 42 total wins and 19 away victories against Everton.",
      "When questioned if he had discussed Villa's poor track record against United with his team, Emery responded: \"I like usually to share with the players the numbers we have. Our own numbers and also Aston Villa's numbers, also with the trophies they got in the past.",
      "\"The players can analyse better, sometimes - not the moment we are in now - but how is the history for the team. Those numbers really mean a lot. We are facing on Sunday Manchester United ... and it is Manchester United!\".",
      "\"We must be motivated how we are now and how we are setting our objectives. We are third, but the reality is that we were at the bottom at the beginning.",
      "\"We are competing to be consistent in Europe and at the end of the season to try to get into a European position and also get trophies in different competitions.",
      "\"To be consistent and in the demands we are now, setting these demands every day higher, this is the way and the motivation we have.",
      "\"How we can achieve three points on Sunday? This is our motivation. Of course, we connect with our supporters at Villa Park fantastically, and the connection is the best quality we can have.",
      "\"There are lot things, individually and collectively, that give us confidence and motivation to help us get it again.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have climbed up to sixth in the top-flight table after a dismal beginning to the season, but they face a tall order when they travel to Villa Park. Unai Emery's squad have won their last nine games in all competitions.",
      "McTominay has thrived since leaving Old Trafford in 2024 for Napoli, having won a league title and been named Serie A's Most Valuable Player last year for his contributions.",
      "On Thursday evening, his side faced AC Milan in a crunch Supercoppa Italiana semi-final and they emerged as 2-0 victors thanks to goals from David Neres and United loanee Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "But in the 81st minute, with Napoli 2-0 to the good a fight broke out. McTominay committed a foul in midfield and the referee blew the whistle. But as he did, the ball rolled towards ex-Chelsea star Fikayo Tomori.",
      "Tomori, with McTominay still running at him, booted the ball at the Scottish international. McTominay did not take kindly to this and squared up to Tomori, with team-mates flooding in to break the pair up.",
      "Words were exchanged and McTominay was furious. Both players received yellow cards for the altercation which mainly consisted of pushing and shouting and the game ended 2-0.",
      "If transfer rumours are to be believed then McTominay could soon be joined in Naples by young Kobbie Mainoo. The 20-year-old has failed to break into Amorim's first-team plans and even made a loan request over the summer.",
      "Mainoo continues to ride the bench and has been surrounded by rumours linking him with a move away from Old Trafford come January. With McTominay and Hojlund currently on loan with Napoli, the Italian side have emerged as a potential suitor.",
      "Before the cup final win, Napoli's sporting director Giovanni Manna spoke out and addressed the speculation linking Mainoo with a transfer to his club.",
      "Manna explained to Sportmediaset: \"Mainoo? I've always said we need to be very thoughtful and cautious in the January transfer window.",

      "Barcelona are increasingly likely to sign Marcus Rashford permanently, with a decision on Hansi Flick's future boosting his chances. Rashford, 28, sealed a dream move to Barca by joining them on a season-long loan in July.",
      "The deal includes an option for Barcelona to purchase the England international for just £26million, despite having two-and-a-half years left on his contract at United. Rashford has contributed to 15 goals in his first 23 matches for Flick's side, helping them open up a four-point gap over Real Madrid in La Liga.",
      "His goal to wrap up Wednesday's hard-fought 2-0 win away to third-tier side Guadalajara was another important contribution. As things stand, Barcelona are more likely to trigger their clause than not.",
      "That's according to Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo - but there's a catch. Camp Nou chiefs want to see how Rashford fares competing with the fit-again Raphinha during the second half of this season.",
      "Rashford has predominately played on the left of Barcelona's attack since joining. That's the position in which vice-captain Raphinha shone last season, racking up an incredible 34 goals and 22 assists goals in 57 games, and helping Barca win a domestic treble.",
      "However, Raphinha has been used as a No.10 by Flick on occasion this season and with veteran striker Robert Lewandowski's contract expiring in June, Rashford will be looking to nail down one of the positions. What's more is that reports from Germany claim that Barcelona want to extend Flick's contract beyond 2027.",
      "The ex-Bayern Munich boss is a big fan of Rashford, so signing a new deal would only increase the likelihood of a permanent stay for the loanee. It's not to just on the pitch where Flick admirers Rashford either.",
      "After leaving Rashford on the bench for a recent game, Flick recalled: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected, and the last time I checked with him he replied me, 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions. The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important'.",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I am so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has shed light on his former team-mate Marcus Rashford, discussing how their playing styles worked well together.",
      "Rashford, a product of United's academy set-up, made his first-team debut in 2016 at the age of 18. He went on to rack up over 420 appearances for the Red Devils across all competitions, netting 138 goals and providing 78 assists.",
      "However, following the appointment of Ruben Amorim last November, Rashford found his game time reduced and spent the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "This season, he's plying his trade in La Liga with Barcelona, where he's scored seven times in 23 appearances to date during his loan spell.",
      "Fernandes, meanwhile, joined United from Sporting CP in January 2020 and quickly became a key figure. In nearly six years at Old Trafford, he's clocked up over 300 appearances and was handed the captain's armband in July 2023.",
      "Since 2020, Rashford and Fernandes have shared the pitch on more than 200 occasions, contributing to 26 goals between them.",
      "While Fernandes has played alongside some top-tier forwards over the years, including recent summer signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, his on-field partnership with Rashford remains one of the most effective.",
      "Speaking on Rio Meets on the Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, the 31-year-old reflected on the bonds he's forged with team-mates, both current and former, including Rashford, Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial.",
      "\"With Rashy,\" Fernandes said. \"It was more about the type of player I am and the type of player he is.",
      "\"So the type of service he needs was kind of a match between us two. Rashy’s runs in behind were unbelievable and powerful.\"",
      "It remains to be seen if the two will ever be reunited at United. The Spanish heavyweights have an option in Rashford's loan that allows them to land the forward on a permanent basis next summer for £26m.",
      "But if Barcelona look to strike an agreement worth less than that set figure, United will have to decide whether to pull out of a deal and potentially bring Rashford back to Manchester.",
      "This Sunday sees Fernandes and United take on a challenging away fixture in the Premier League against surprise title-chasers Aston Villa. Then, on Boxing Day, United welcome Newcastle to Old Trafford as they look to improve their league position before the New Year arrives.",
      "Meanwhile, Rashford and Barcelona face Villarreal away on Sunday, hoping to extend their advantage at the summit of La Liga. Following that, they'll enjoy a brief winter hiatus before resuming action in early January with another away encounter, this time against Espanyol.",

      "Fortunately for both London clubs, the tournament will not impact their squad availability, with no players set to be involved. It is a different story for United, however, who will have to navigate the next month without some big names.",
      "The Red Devils will miss Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who are representing Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Morocco respectively. All three of those nations, particularly Morocco, are likely to reach the latter stages of the competition.",

      "Participating nations can name up to two reserve players who can be called upon before the tournament kicks off in light of any last-minute injury concerns.",
      "Guessand joined Villa from French side Nice back in the summer for a fee in the region of £30million.",
      "The right winger has scored two goals in his 18 appearances across all competitions so far. Both came in Europa League matches, the first against Go Ahead Eagles and the second during their recent trip to face Basel.",

      "Having left hometown club Royal Antwerp to sign for United aged 16, the midfielder became close friends with Adnan Januzaj, and played alongside Jesse Lingard, Michael Keane and Andreas Pereira. In 2014, Ekangamene joined Carlisle United on loan and made his professional debut in their League One clash with Bristol City.",
      "The Belgian decided to leave Old Trafford later that year and returned to his homeland, joining Zulte Waregem on a four-year deal. Ekangamene went on to play for clubs in the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain and Gibraltar.",

      "Following on, Bryan Mbeumo is in the same situation representing Cameroon.",
      "They have group stage games against Gabon (Dec 24), Ivory Coast (Dec 28) and Mozambique (Dec 31). Similarly, the attacker could be back in Manchester in time to play against Leeds if his country don't make it beyond the first hurdle.",
      "Knockout stage qualification will only increase Mbeumo's absence, which again could extend seven matches in total.",
      "Finally, Noussair Mazraoui will represent tournament hosts Morocco at AFCON in the coming weeks.",
      "His country have scheduled group stage matches against Comoros (Dec 21), Mali (Dec 26), and Zambia (Dec 29). Were a major shock to take place and the hosts be eliminated this early on, the full-back would miss only three United matches and be eligible to return against Leeds.",

      "Since his British-record £125m transfer from Newcastle United to Liverpool, Alexander Isak has struggled to match his previously goalscoring form.",
      "To start, he is barely having an impact on play for the Reds, averaging only 14 touches per game - and an even lesser two touches in the opposition penalty area - per appearance so far this term...",

      "The Brazilian has been penalised 13 times - three more than any other player in the division. What's more, it has cost him four goals ruled out for offside so far...",
      "Coming back to Wolves' woes, perhaps nobody can feel more aggrieved by this than Hugo Bueno.",
      "The 23-year-old full-back has actually been one of the Premier League's biggest attacking inspirations. With 21 successful crosses in open play, no other player has managed more than that so far this season.",
      "He'll be frustrated his teammates aren't converting his lay-ups into goals, with Wolves on the scoresheet a measly six times this campaign - only two of those actually coming from crosses...",

United have not won the Premier League since Ferguson claimed his 13th league title in 2013 and have been struggling for consistency ever since their legendary boss retired.",
      "Their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth on Monday showed improvements in attack following the £200million spend on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, but also their leaky defence.",
      "Ferguson remains a regular at Old Trafford and has been keeping a close eye on their development under Amorim, who has now been in charge for over a year and has won 23 of his 59 matches.",
      "\"He (Amorim) is a good personality. It is not easy,” Ferguson told Press Box PR. “I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "\"We are now in the same situation. It could be 10 years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle. It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\"",
      "United face Aston Villa in the league on Sunday and Amorim was asked about Ferguson's prediction in his pre-match press conference. “He understands football more than me, especially English football,” Amorim said. “I think we are not (going to) take that long to win a league.",
      "“I don’t know which manager is going to be here, but I truly believe that we can fight for the title in the next years. I think it’s not going to take so many years, but you never know.”",
      "Amorim also responded to Kobbie Mainoo's half-brother wearing a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Old Trafford on Monday in a post that went viral on social media. “No, it was not Kobbie that wore the t-shirt,\" Amorim said when asked if he'd spoken to the midfielder about it.",
      "“He is not going to start because of the t-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the t-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "“I am used to (it). I am here for a year. It’s not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.”",

The England international is yet to be handed a single Premier League start this season and has been limited to 11 substitute appearances under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "During Monday night's thrilling 4-4 draw vs Bournemouth at Old Trafford, Mainoo once again entered the game from the bench, receiving a rousing ovation from the home supporters. The 20-year-old has been the subject of intense transfer speculation in recent months, with the January window looming on the horizon.",
      "Chelsea, West Ham and Napoli are among the clubs reportedly circling for Mainoo's signature. United are, though, said to have no intention of allowing their academy graduate to depart just yet.",
      "However, Shearer believes a parting of ways could benefit all concerned parties.",
      "\"Clearly the manager doesn't fancy Kobbie Mainoo,\" Shearer said in an interview with Betfair. \"Because if you can't get into a team when they're really struggling, then there's an issue.",
      "\"And I guess it looks from the outside as if a move would be better off for all parties.",
      "\"This is not the first time we've seen that Manchester United players are not fitting into what the manager wants. And he hasn't been afraid to get rid of them or let them go out on loan or sell them - and that looks as if it's going to be the case for him.",
      "\"I don't know, I'm not inside the club, I don't know what his attitude's like. But I guess, looking in from the outside, then it would be best for both parties if he could get out and play some football in January and onwards.",
      "\"Whether that's on a loan or whether that's a permanent deal, then we'll have to wait and see. But clearly, if you're not playing, you have to look at the situation and get out.\"",
      "When quizzed about Mainoo's limited playing time this season, Amorim has been candid about team choices.",
      "\"I see him [Mainoo] as a starter like the other players,\" Amorim said last month. \"I have to make a choice and then - in the end - it's not been Kobbie.",

Amass shared a photograph of himself holding a player of the month trophy at Sheffield Wednesday, whilst Chido's post showed him celebrating a goal for the Under-21s.",

      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.",

      "\"I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.",

United shelled out over £200million on new players in the summer and the new additions have begun to gel in recent weeks under Ruben Amorim’s management.",
      "United brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens before the start of the 2025/26 season, while January signing Diego Leon also arrived following their 15th-place finish. Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp and was installed as the No.1 goalkeeper, with Andre Onana shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "Some pundits were worried that Lammens may struggle with the jump up in quality, having only played in Belgium’s top flight, but he has settled well between the posts. Ferguson, who managed United between 1987 and 2013, is still a regular at Old Trafford to watch Amorim’s side and is a fan of Lammens.",
      "\"I think the appointment of the goalkeeper has made a difference,” Ferguson told Press Box PR. “He's young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player. United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped.",
      "\"The other two, Mbeumo and Cunha, they look as if they will contribute to the recovery of our form.” United are sixth in the Premier League following their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth on Monday at Old Trafford.",
      "That high-scoring draw means United are now joint second-top scorers in the Premier League, level with leaders Arsenal on 30 goals, with Manchester City (38) the only club to have scored more. But their 26 goals conceded shows that issues remain in defence, with that the highest of any side in the top 12 of the table.",

The 2-0 victory against their Serie A rivals secured Antonio Conte's squad a spot in the final - where they'll face either Bologna or Inter Milan, who clash on Friday night.",
      "The four-club competition, taking place in Saudi Arabia this year, includes the champions and runners-up from last season's Serie A and Coppa Italia. There won't be back-to-back winners, as defending champions AC Milan have now been knocked out of the competition.",
      "Hojlund - who is loan at Napoli from United - netted in the 63rd minute to provide his side with a comfortable cushion heading into the final stages. Alongside the significance of his strike, the Danish forward's post-match social media behaviour also caught some attention.",
      "He shared a photograph of himself sprawled on the turf after tumbling in the wake of his goal. The image came with the words: \"No context Rasmus.\"",
      "Supporters seemed largely unbothered by the mysterious caption, instead flooding the replies with compliments for the forward - who appears to be regaining his confidence since leaving United this summer. Another former United player flourishing since departing Old Trafford is McTominay.",
      "He was also involved against AC Milan, although his night featured a contrasting type of incident. With 81 minutes on the clock, AC Milan were granted a free-kick after a tackle from the Scotland international.",
      "The ball subsequently found its way to ex-Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori, who seemed to kick it back towards McTominay. The situation quickly escalated between the two teams.",
      "If not for the neutral location of Al-Awwal Park in Riyadh, things could have become even more heated. McTominay took umbrage at Tomori's actions and confronted the defender, going head-to-head until Napoli striker Lorenzo Lucca stepped in to restrain him.",
      "Both players received yellow cards, and Napoli managed to hold their ground for the rest of the match, securing their spot in the Supercoppa final set for Monday night. Meanwhile, back in Serie A, the title race is still too close to call as we head into 2026.",
      "Only three points separate the top four, with Napoli currently in third place, trailing leaders Inter Milan by two points. Hojlund and McTominay might soon be joined by another former United teammate - as Kobbie Mainoo is rumoured to be on his way to Naples in the January transfer window.",

United finished 15th last term, their lowest finish in the Premier League era, and missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "According to ESPN, a fierce meeting between Eto'o and his committee ended with them alleging Brys had committed \"11 infractions\" ranging from \"disrespectful\" and \"biased\" remarks, \"professional misconduct\" and \"manipulation\" of players, where they specifically accuse him of trying to turn them against the country's FA.",
      "Despite this, Brys insists he has not received any formal communication from the Cameroonian FA regarding his dismissal, even though Pagou is in situ. He has been working, business as usual, except this situation could not be more unusual.",
      "He submitted his own squad list for the competition, featuring Onana as well as other experienced Cameroon stars Vincent Aboubakar, Eric Choupo-Moting and Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui. On the same day, Pagou issued his own squad for the tournament, without the aforementioned quartet.",
      "Last week, confusion reined as to whether the excluded Onana, Aboubakar, Choupo-Moting and Ngadeu-Ngadjui would actually be involved in north Africa. A Cameroonian official has made it clear in the same source any player who is on Brys' list, but not on Pagou's, will not be involved.",
      "The former Cameroon manager, despite asserting that he is still the current boss, has been left furious by this situation. He specifically lashed out at Eto'o, claiming the experienced quartet have been excluded because they challenged the ex-Chelsea forward's authority.",
      "He told Afrik Foot: \"Eto'o has left out important players, and leaders, because he's obviously the one who made this list. How can you go to such a tournament without a world-class goalkeeper, or without Aboubakar? Because these are players with character, who stand up to the president.\"",

      "Manchester United have been tipped to revive their interest in Ruben Neves in January. The Red Devils were linked with the Portugal international before he left Wolves for Al Hilal in 2023, and those connections have now resurfaced.",
      "Neves, 28, captained Wolves to promotion to the Premier League in 2018 and played more than 250 times for the Molineux club in six years. He became one of the Saudi Pro League's big statement signings, though, following compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo in moving to the Gulf.",
      "Al Hilal paid a reported £47million for the midfielder, who is believed to be one of the higher earners in Saudi football. His contract is expiring this summer, though, potentially paving the way for a cut-price January exit.",
      "According to The Mail, Al Hilal are prepared to accept around £20m for Neves, who is said to have no plans to extend his contract. That could make him a more realistic prospect than some of the other midfield targets on United's radar.",
      "Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are both high on the Red Devils' list, but neither is unlikely to be available for less than £100m in January. If Ruben Amorim decides new blood is required in the middle of the park, Neves could tick a lot of boxes.",
      "Neves helped Al Hilal win the Saudi Pro League title in his first season, with the Riyadh club going the whole season unbeaten. They only finished second last term, though, replacing manager Jorge Jesus with former Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi at the end of the campaign.",
      "They are unbeaten after nine games of Inzaghi's first season at the helm, though they're four points adrift of league leaders Al Nassr. Neves has scored four goals - two of those in his last two games - as well as one in a King's Cup quarter-final victory over Al Fateh.",
      "United's links with Neves come at a time when Bruno Fernandes has once again been linked with a move in the opposite direction. Al Hilal failed with a summer move for the Old Trafford captain, who opened the door to a future move in a November interview which has come to light this month.",
      "\"I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge,\" former Sporting CP star Fernandes told Canal 11 (via Maisfutebol and translated by Sport Witness).. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia,”",
      "“My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I’ll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.\"",
      "He said he decided to stay after conversations with manager Amorim but was \"hurt\" by the club's position on a potential exit. \"“I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club,\" he added.",
      "\"The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot.\"",

      "Aston Villa head into Sunday’s clash with Manchester United on the back of nine consecutive wins in all competitions. Unai Emery’s side have lost just two of their last 12 matches in league and cup, and six of their last seven games have featured both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals. The hosts have netted at least twice in seven of their last eight outings, but have only managed one clean sheet in their previous seven matches.",
      "However, Villa’s recent record against Manchester United is less impressive, with just two wins from the last 10 meetings between the sides in all competitions. United have lost only once in their last four visits to Villa Park, earning two draws and a win in that span. Five of the last eight encounters between these teams have seen both sides score and over 2.5 goals.",
      "In the Premier League, Manchester United have suffered just one defeat in their last 10 games, though four of those have ended in draws. Seven of United’s last 10 league matches have produced both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals, and they’ve scored at least twice in eight of those fixtures. With both teams in strong attacking form, another high-scoring encounter is expected at Villa Park this weekend.",
      "Unai Emery faces a headache with Emi Martinez (back) and Pau Torres (calf) facing late fitness tests ahead of the match at Villa Park. Jadon Sancho is not available as he is not allowed to face his parent club as per loan rules while Tyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) continue to serve long layoffs.",
      "Not much has changed in terms of the injury front with Harry Maguire (thigh) and Matthijs de Ligt (back) hope to end their setbacks later this month. However, the Red Devils will need to make adjustments over the festive period with Bryan Mbuemo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui all on AFCON duty with their respective nations.",

      "Manchester United are entering a very tricky portion of their campaign after three players departed for the Africa Cup of Nations. As such, the club could do with as few distractions as possible, but not everyone close to the squad has complied.",
      "In fact, United icon Roy Keane has described his disdain following a recent development in the Kobbie Mainoo storyline. That's after the midfielder's half-sibling was spotted wearing a divisive piece of clothing during the latest Premier League fixture.",
      "Amid the furore concerning Mainoo's playing time (or lack thereof), the midfielder has remained largely silent on the matter. The same can't be said for half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames, however, after he watched Monday's 4-4 draw against Bournemouth while wearing a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt.",
      "Mainoo came off the bench for the final half hour in what was a topsy-turvy encounter, during which the lead changed hands three times. Almost halfway through the Premier League campaign, Mainoo is still waiting on his first start of the season.",
      "The stunt might have gone under the radar had Mainoo-Hames, a former Love Island contestant, not made the decision to pose in front of the Old Trafford turf and posted the image on Instagram. Word of the incident eventually got back to club legend Keane, who addressed it on the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "The Irishman asked: \"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer. He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie [Carragher] made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'He has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane was open to the prospect of Mainoo going out on loan but challenged the prospect to prove Amorim wrong at Old Trafford instead. Amorim, meanwhile, has said he's be open to sitting down for a discussion with the player if approached.",
      "Many a United fan, and likely Amorim himself, is wondering just how the club will fare during the absence of their AFCON stars. And there's little doubt Mbeumo will be the biggest presence missing from their right flank.",
      "However, it's perhaps Mbeumo himself who should feel concern after a supercomputer tipped his Cameroon side for an early departure. The model, which was devised by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com, forecast the Indomitable Lions will fail to get out of Group F after facing the Ivory Coast, Gabon and Mozambique.",
      "Mbeumo's absence would therefore be relatively short, and he may even be back for the fixture against Leeds on January 4 as a result. Former United defender Paul Parker recently put into words the effect Mbeumo's absence will have on the team, with no other player at Amorim's disposal able to fulfil the same duties.",
      "\"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON,\" said two-time Premier League champion Parker. \"They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.\"",

The Red Devils face some lofty competition for the Cherries star, who has a release clause of £65million that activates in January.",
      "Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool are all interested in agreeing a deal for the Ghana international. Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in London at the end of last season, but United were put off by Bournemouth’s £80m plus asking price.",

Amass posted a picture of him with a player of the month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the Under-21s.",
      "Amorim insisted his comments weren't negative and said the response of the pair of 18-year-olds summed up the sense of entitlement that he feels continues to linger around the club. \"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.",
      "\"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping. That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement.",

      "\"I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.",

He's not going to start because of the t-shirt but he's not going to the bench because of the t-shirt. He's going to play if we feel that he's the right guy to play,\" said Amorim.",

      "The 83-year-old won 13 Premier League titles in his time at Old Trafford but feels it could be a while before they are at the top of the tree again domestically, offering qualified backing to Amorim in the process.",
      "\"He [Amorim] is a good personality,\" he said. \"It is not easy. I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "\"We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle. It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\"",

I don't know which manager is going to be here, but I truly believe that we can fight for the title in the next years, and I think it's not going to take so many years, but you never know.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim addressed the situations surrounding Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes during his press conference.",
      "After his brother wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt, questions were asked as to whether the midfielder knew what was going to happen. Amorim rejected these concerns and suggested he would not punish the midfielder for something his family member did.",
      "Amorim added he was aware of what Fernandes had said before the interview describing him feeling hurt were published. The United boss feels the situation is now clear between the captain and the club.",
      "As for team news, United have not lost any other players to injury ahead of the trip to Aston Villa. Both Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt remain unavailable and will not be travelling to the West Midlands.",
      "United's head coach also provided more context on his recent comments about the academy.",
      "Take a look back at what Amorim said below...",
      "Amorim laid into the Manchester United legends telling Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club and urged the midfielder to stay and fight for his place, insisting there is no issue after his half-brother wore a controversial t-shirt to the game against Bournemouth on Monday. Mainoo's brother Jordan wore a t-shirt saying 'Free Kobbie Mainoo', but Amorim said he hadn't felt the need to talk to the academy graduate about the incident and said he wouldn't be punishing him for the actions of a family member.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim has slammed Harry Amass and Chido Obi for posting pictures on Instagram in response to his comments about the academy last week, labelling them \"entitled\" and saying it sums up the mood around the Manchester United squad. Amorim raised the issue of the two players last week, saying Amass was now \"struggling\" at the bottom of the Championship and that Chido wasn't starting every week for the club's Under-21 side.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That's all from part one of Amorim's press conference. The second part will be available from 10.30pm this evening.",
      "He understands football more, especially English football, I don’t think we’ll take that long to win the league [ten years]. I don’t know which manager will be here, but I truly believe we can fight for the title in the next years. It is not going to take so many years but you never know.",
      "In leadership, it’s the moment of the club, you have to fight all the fights. We are improving as a team, as a group, we going to improve in these small things. That will make a difference even to suffer goals, if we are a different group we will suffer less goals but we are scoring more so let's think about the positives and think about the Villa game.",
      "I think the feeling a little bit of entitled one we have in our club, sometimes strong words is not bad words, difficult moments are not bad for the kids. We don’t need always to be accolades for every situation. You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends so if you don’t play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, stay and fight, let's overcome maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling. I’m the first one to say I’m failing. Outside the pitch I guarantee I’m not failing this club. It is is something in our club and the players sometimes they forget the players what it means to play for Man United, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. It’s the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to talk to me. That is the way we solve things. We need to change as a club.",
      "I didn’t say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man United. Sometimes you play for Man United and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man United. That was my point but let's move on.",
      "It continues a little bit of everything on my desk, every problem at the football club is still me that has to deal with it. It will take time. Kobbie’s job is to train and play, I felt he did really well in this game. If he has to play he is going to play.",
      "I don’t know if it’s fair, he spoke about his feelings. He needs to answer to that, not me. He is an example, he gives everything and puts everything on the line in every training and every match, in that he is special, we need to step up to have that feeling. We need to ask him, I think he’s a big example in the group.",
      "He spoke his feelings. I think when I watch Bruno training and playing he is a special character, the numbers and amount of games prove he is a different player.",
      "The difference is he spoke with the club before the interview and said what he was feeling. We can avoid these things because we already know the noise. He talked with the board and I think everything is clear.",
      "No [conversations with Kobbie]. He played really well, that is the important thing, my office is always open, nobody went there this week so everything is normal and we are ready to go to Villa.",
      "We watch the game again against Bournemouth we can avoid those goals. There was a lot of transition and we have to put everything on the line when we’re defending and sometimes we’re not doing that.",
      "Everything can happen. They have a manager with a lot of experience, when you watch Villa you can sense it’s a very mature team, they don’t panic when they’re losing, don’t feel overwhelmed when winning, they can control the emotion all the time. They are a very strong team. If they fight to the end I don’t know.",
      "[He laughs] No, was not Kobbie that wore the t-shirt, he’s not going to start because of the t-shirt and he’s not going to the bench because of the t-shirt. He will play if we feel he’s the right guys. I’m used to it, I’ve been here for a year. I’m not going to do something to Kobbie because someone on his family did something. If he is the right guy he is going to play.",
      "No. Nobody recovers and nobody else is out just the guys you already know.",
      "I think everyone is well, we have one more training but today the rest of the guys are ready to go.",
      "We will be bringing you the quotes shortly...",
      "We are not long off Amorim's press conference. It should be a big one considering everything which has happened this week.",
      "It won't be long now until we hear what Amorim has to say before the trip to Villa. There is plenty on the agenda this afternoon and here are just some of the topics which could be touched upon...",
      "Speaking this week, United's legendary manager has admitted it could be a long time before the Reds manage to be competitive for the Premier League title again. However, Ferguson also gave his backing to Amorim after a mixed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "With everything that has happened this week, it is easy to see the game at Villa as a bit of an afterthought. However, taking their eye off Unai Emery's side would be to their detriment. They have won their last nine games in a row in all competitions and last lost at the start of November to Liverpool. Villa are third in the Premier League and it will be a difficult test for the Reds. Sancho is ineligible to face his parent club.",
      "In his latest interview, this time with Rio Ferdinand, Fernandes admitted he could have won more if he had not shown the loyalty he has to United.",
      "I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim's press conference could be very interesting considering everything which has happened this week. His response to questions surrounding Fernandes will be particularly telling. Amorim has been a big fan of Fernandes and has refused to drop him this season. It seems clear the United boss would not want his captain to leave.",
      "Scott McTominay was asked this week about the improvement some players show when they leave United.",
      "The former Reds midfielder has been brilliant since his move to Napoli and he's not the only player to have flourished since his Old Trafford departure.",
      "However, he refused to say United were the problem when asked about the progress some players make when they leave the club, calling the theory \"a myth\".",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "We'll have every word from the United boss at 1.30pm today.",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo are both expected to be on the agenda after the former's bombshell interview and the latter's brother wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Monday's game.",
      "Team news and injury updates will also be given.",
      "Stick with us for updates and reaction.",
      "Two Bruno Fernandes interviews have been released this week and they've sparked plenty of debate.",
      "The United captain told Canal 11 that he felt the club were open to him leaving in the summer, yet then told a podcast that United asked him to stay.",
      "Amorim is sure to be asked about Fernandes' future this afternoon.",
      "Here's what the club think on the matter >>>",
      "Hello and welcome to the Amorim press conference blog.",
      "The United head coach will be addressing the media today ahead of Sunday's trip to Aston Villa. However, questions on the game could become secondary to what has happened off the pitch since the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.",
      "Fernandes is likely to be a big topic of conversation after admitting he felt 'hurt' by the club being open to selling him in the summer. United deny this was the case but the captain's latest comments will be giving Amorim a headache he wasn't expecting.",
      "Mainoo could also be brought up again after his brother's t-shirt stunt in midweek. With Casemiro suspended, the academy graduate could be given a rare start on Sunday.",
      "Stay tuned for all the updates from the press conference..."

      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery insists he is determined to get the best out of Manchester United loanee Jadon Sancho after a difficult start to life in the West Midlands. Sancho was one of the so-called 'Bomb Squad' who requested to leave Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "Eventually, the Reds managed to agree a season-long loan move to Villa for the former England international on deadline day. But, while Emery's men have flourished from strength-to-strength this season and sit just three points off the leaders Arsenal at the start of the weekend, Sancho has struggled.",
      "The 25-year-old has yet to start a match in the Premier League and in 13 appearances he has failed to register a goal or an assist. On Sunday, United travel to Villa but Sancho will be ineligible to face his parent club. Before the game, Emery was asked for his thoughts on Sancho.",
      "The former Arsenal manager said: \"Jadon is still being young. He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well.",
      "\"Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to. But in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding [of] himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"The first match back he will play is against Chelsea. He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it.\" United head into Sunday's match knowing they have a good record against Villa.",
      "Only against Everton have United beaten an opponent more than the West Midlands club. When this was put to Emery, the Spaniard insisted it was not something being discussed internally.",
      "\"I like usually to share with the players the numbers we have. Our own numbers and also Aston Villa’s numbers, also with the trophies they got in the past,\" Emery concluded.",
      "\"The players can analyse better, sometimes - not the moment we are in now - but how is the history for the team. Those numbers really mean a lot. We are facing on Sunday Manchester United… and it is Manchester United.",
      "\"We must be motivated how we are now and how we are setting our objectives. We are third, but the reality is that we were at the bottom at the beginning.",
      "\"We are competing to be consistent in Europe and at the end of the season to try to get into a European position and also get trophies in different competitions. To be consistent and in the demands we are now, setting these demands every day higher, this is the way and the motivation we have.",
      "\"How we can achieve three points on Sunday? This is our motivation. Of course, we connect with our supporters at Villa Park fantastically, and the connection is the best quality we can have.\"",

      "As Ruben Amorim laid waste to his Manchester United players, barely anyone was spared. Amorim railed against a sense of entitlement within the club, bemoaned the failure of anyone to knock on his door to air their frustrations and complained about the leadership group failing to take some issues off his hands.",
      "This was the day Amorim upped the ante with his squad. Perhaps Bruno Fernandes was one who emerged unscathed, described as a \"special character\" and an \"example\". How Amorim must wish he could clone his countryman.",
      "This felt like a calculated attack by Amorim. After 13 months in charge, he is still unhappy with what he is seeing, not necessarily on the pitch, but off it, and he is taking it upon himself to be the man who turns that around.",
      "\"Sometimes I am the first to say that I am failing this club inside the pitch, I have that feeling we are not performing the way we should,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Outside the pitch, I guarantee you I am not failing this club. I think it is something in our club. The players sometimes forget what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that is the feeling I have.\"",
      "This is the culture Amorim is railing against. His most brutal attack came when he was asked about the quickly deleted social media posts by Harry Amass and Chido Obi on Monday, as they took exception to their head coach's comments about their own struggles.",
      "Amorim insisted his comments shouldn't be seen as negative and twice used the word \"entitlement\" as he made a broader point about attitudes inside the club.",
      "\"I think it is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids. We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "A week ago, Amorim had told Kobbie Mainoo that his office door was always open and that if he wanted to leave in January, he should come and tell him. He told Amass and Chido that if they had an issue, they knew where to find him.",
      "Twice, Amorim repeated the idea that he was always available to his players, and his assertion that nobody was coming to see him felt like another dig; too many were happy to complain on social media or to friends and family, rather than going to their manager.",
      "There was also criticism of his six-man leadership group, which consists of Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martínez, and Tom Heaton.",
      "In the summer, Amorim said he wanted that group to deal with more dressing room issues and that they couldn't let everything fall on his shoulders. Five months later, nothing has changed.",
      "\"It continues a bit everything on my desk, every problem it is still me, but again my door is still open,\" he said.",
      "Amorim has always been an open and engaging communicator in press conferences. He talks freely and sometimes has a message to get across and isn't afraid to throw a few punches in the process.",
      "This week, most of those messages were aimed at his own squad. It's time to see how they respond, and whether the 40-year-old can be the man to end the entitlement he feels is holding Manchester United back.",

      "As Manchester United sought to add a goalkeeper to their squad in the closing days and hours of the summer transfer window, they had two No.1s waiting by the phone ready to receive the call. United's transfer executives were weighing up moves for Senne Lammens and Emiliano Martinez, two goalkeepers at very different stages of their careers.",
      "Lammens, 23, had never played outside of Belgium and had fewer than 100 games under his belt at this stage, of which only 68 had been in the top division. Martinez was a World Cup winner, a two-time winner of the Yashin Trophy for the world's best goalkeeper and had 250 Premier League games under his belt. He might have been about to turn 33, but he still had plenty to offer.",
      "In the end, United's transfer pivot towards youth and data won the battle. Lammens arrived as United's most inexperienced first-choice goalkeeper for a long time. He has had a solid start to his Old Trafford career, if not spectacular, and didn't have a great game against Bournemouth on Monday.",
      "But there is clear potential there. Lammens is a calm goalkeeper who always looks unflustered. His kicking has been secure and he has spread confidence through the defence thanks to his serenity, something that had been lacking in recent seasons.",
      "Martinez had set his heart on a move to United. He had tears in his eyes as he waved to the Villa fans at the end of last season in a move that seemed to signal he would be on his way in the summer. Even on deadline day, a switch to Old Trafford looked a possibility.",
      "For whatever reason, it never materialised. Marco Bizot began the season in goal for Villa, but when Martinez stayed, Unai Emery brought him back in, and he has once again been outstanding at Villa Park, a key figure in what is an unlikely push to enter the title race throughout the first half of the season.",
      "Villa will certainly be the favourites on Sunday. They have won nine in a row in all competitions and 15 of their last 17 games, a remarkable run of form that has propelled them into contention after a disappointing start. You would expect Lammens to be the busier goalkeeper.",
      "That's if Martinez even makes it. He has missed the last two games due to a back injury, and given the possibility of him having another strong performance to deny the club that considered signing him just four months ago, it might be easier for Ruben Amorim if he is unavailable.",
      "It's far too early to judge the success or otherwise of Lammens, who is clearly a goalkeeper still learning his trade. If United had made their decision based on the goalkeeper likely to be a better performer this season, then they would have gone for Martinez. However, under Ineos, there has been a shift towards long-term thinking.",
      "When United signed Lammens from Royal Antwerp for £21.7million, director of football Jason Wilcox highlighted his \"potential\" and after making his debut, Amorim admitted to being surprised by the impact the young goalkeeper had made. His rock-solid debut against Sunderland earned him those comparisons with Peter Schmeichel from the Stretford End.",
      "It was never going to be an entirely smooth journey for Lammens, however, and there is maybe just the hint of a question or two being asked now, although he clearly remains United's best option in goal. The alternative was to sign someone else, and that someone else could well be at the opposite end of the pitch this weekend.",

      "Ruben Amorim laid down the law to Manuel Ugarte last month when he told the Manchester United midfielder he had to improve in training to force his way back into his plans. A return of 13 minutes in five Premier League games since then would suggest the message hasn’t been taken on board.",
      "Ugarte hasn’t even made it off the bench in four of those five games and it feels like his Old Trafford career is teetering on the brink amid plans for a major midfield rebuild. Perhaps this weekend will offer the Uruguayan a chance to resuscitate it. It could well be the final chance. With Casemiro suspended after collecting a fifth booking of the season, Ugarte seems like the only possible replacement in that holding midfield role.",
      "If he is overlooked for Kobbie Mainoo, another player Amorim clearly has doubts about, it will surely spell the end for Ugarte. If he plays and doesn’t deliver, it could be just as damning. Last month, Amorim stressed that he wanted to help his former Sporting charge out of his funk, but what has happened since suggests that it hasn’t been achieved.",
      "“You can sense a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" he said. \"He is struggling at the moment but it is our job to try to help and help him to feel like I felt when he was a Sporting player. But it is a different world. He needs to adapt, and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "It was the second time Amorim had been brutal about Ugarte, telling him after the Europa League final that he wasn’t the same player that the head coach encountered in Lisbon. Their shared history together should have been a significant advantage to Ugarte. He knew Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system, he had a head start when it came to the demands of the Portuguese and what he wanted from players in Ugarte’s position. But he hasn’t put it to good use.",
      "Ugarte left Sporting to join Paris Saint-Germain and managed a year in Ligue 1 before United spent £50.5m on him. His confidence looks to have been rocked by a tricky year in Paris and the chaos of Old Trafford.",
      "He wasn’t Erik ten Hag’s first choice for that position in the summer of 2024 and had a sluggish start to his time at the club. Amorim’s arrival led to a brief renaissance but there has been very little evidence across 18 months that Ugarte is going to cut the mustard.",
      "An exit in January might be unlikely, especially if Mainoo leaves on loan, but a summer transfer is a possibility, especially if Ugarte doesn’t find the improvement required.",
      "The future of every United midfielder is up in the air at the moment, for one reason or another. For Ugarte, the reason is his own performances, and what happens next is largely in his hands. He can take a step forward at Villa Park on Sunday, but if he doesn’t it could push him closer to the exit door.",

      "But Ivory Coast are tipped to go deep into the tournament, therefore Amad could be required to play for his country as late as the AFCON final on January 18, 2026. If so, he would miss seven club matches in total.",
      "Following on, Bryan Mbeumo is in the same situation and will represent Cameroon.",
      "They have group stage games against Gabon (Dec 24), Ivory Coast (Dec 28) and Mozambique (Dec 31). Similarly, the attacker could be back in Manchester in time to play against Leeds if his country don't make it beyond the first hurdle.",
      "Knockout stage qualification will only increase Mbeumo's absence, which again could extend seven matches in total.",
      "Finally, Noussair Mazraoui will represent tournament hosts Morocco at AFCON in the coming weeks.",
      "His country have scheduled group stage matches against Comoros (Dec 21), Mali (Dec 26), and Zambia (Dec 29). Were a major shock to take place and the hosts be eliminated this early on, the full-back would miss only three United matches and be eligible to return against Leeds.",

      "Alan Shearer has backed Kobbie Mainoo to leave Manchester United, given the midfielder's continued lack of regular minutes. Mainoo is yet to start a single Premier League match this season and has made 11 substitute appearances so far this term under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth in the Premier League saw Mainoo make an appearance from the bench, where the 20-year-old received a warm reception from the Old Trafford crowd.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with a move away from United in recent months. With the January transfer window fast approaching, it remains to be seen what the future holds.",
      "Chelsea, West Ham and Napoli are just some of the clubs that have been credited with an interest in signing Mainoo over the last few weeks, although reports have claimed that United have no plans to let the midfielder leave Old Trafford in January despite the speculation.",
      "Shearer has now explained why it may be in Mainoo's best interest to leave United, and why a move may, in turn, also help the Reds.",
      "\"Clearly the manager doesn't fancy Kobbie Mainoo. Because if you can't get into a team when they're really struggling, then there's an issue,\" Shearer told Betfair.",
      "\"And I guess it looks from the outside as if a move would be better off for all parties.",
      "\"This is not the first time we've seen that Manchester United players are not fitting into what the manager wants. And he hasn't been afraid to get rid of them or let them go out on loan or sell them. And that looks as if it's going to be the case for him.",
      "\"I don't know, I'm not inside the club, I don't know what his attitude's like. But I guess looking from the outside, then it would be best for both parties if he could get out and play some football in January and onwards.",
      "\"Whether that's on loan or whether that's a permanent deal, then we'll have to wait and see. But clearly, if you're not playing, you have to look at the situation and get out.\"",
      "Amorim has been asked about Mainoo's lack of game time throughout the season, and he admitted the reason behind his team selection decisions.",
      "\"I see him [Mainoo] as a starter like the other players,\" Amorim said last month. \"I just have to make a choice and then in the end, it's not been Kobbie.",
      "\"In the future, I don't know. Again, I always think the same thing with Casemiro. [He] was not playing and then he plays. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing.\"",
      "United legend Paul Scholes was in agreement with Shearer by stating that Mainoo may be wise to leave Old Trafford, with the former midfielder also responding to the remarks by Amorim.",
      "\"The kid [Mainoo] is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football,\" wrote Scholes on Instagram in response to Amorim's recent quotes about Mainoo.",
      "\"Hate seeing home grown players leave but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson believes it could be at least 10 years before the Reds are battling for the Premier League title and insists he has sympathy for Ruben Amorim. Since the Portuguese head coach took over in November 2024, it has been difficult for United.",
      "Amorim chose to sacrifice the Premier League last season to concentrate on the most likely route to the Champions League through the Europa League. However, this plan backfired as United lost to Tottenham in an underwhelming final. The Reds would go on to finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Since then, United have shown signs of improvement with the attack looking stronger and the Reds currently sitting sixth. However, there are still concerns about Amorim's tactics, with many criticising his reluctance to deviate from a three-at-the-back system, albeit this stance has softened recently due to absentees.",
      "Speaking to Press Box PR, Ferguson believes United are still on a long journey to the force they once were under him. He said: \"He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy. I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee's knees.",
      "\"They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again. We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle.",
      "\"It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\" While Ferguson is pessimistic about United going for the title any time soon, he did provide some comfort for supporters.",
      "\"I think the appointment of the goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] has made a difference,\" he added. \"He's young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player.",
      "\"United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped. The other two, [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha, they look as if they will contribute to the recovery of our form.\"",
      "The Reds will be without the services of Mbeumo until the New Year due to his involvement with Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are also absent for the festive period with Ivory Coast and Morocco respectively.",
      "This weekend, United will also be missing Casemiro from their squad. The Brazilian picked up his fifth yellow card of the season and will serve a one-game ban vs Aston Villa.",
      "His absence could provide an opportunity for Kobbie Mainoo. The academy graduate has yet to start a Premier League fixture this season.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has insisted it is \"myth\" that players improve automatically after leaving Old Trafford and believes it is too easy to blame the club for personal failures. McTominay left United in the summer of 2024 as Manuel Ugarte arrived from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "While the Uruguayan has struggled, McTominay has moved from strength to strength in Italy. He scored 13 goals in all competitions for Antonio Conte's side and became fundamental to their success as they won Serie A last season.",
      "McTominay has continued in similar form this season and recently finished 18th in the Ballon d'Or ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland and Declan Rice. The midfielder's success since leaving Old Trafford is not an uncommon theme.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund have all impressed in spells since leaving Old Trafford recently. But in an interview with CBS Sports, McTominay said it is too easy to suggest the Reds are the problem. He said: \"It’s just too easy of an excuse to say: ‘Oh, they left Man United and now they are doing well.’",
      "\"In my last year, I did well. I scored ten goals and we won a trophy and with Marcus [Rashford] there was obviously different issues which might have transpired which we won’t go into. However, Marcus is a top player and he’s always been a top player.",
      "\"He’s one of the club’s legends and he scored so many goals for Manchester United, done so many great things but because the spotlight is directly on you, it makes it seem a lot worse, in my opinion. Obviously when players go away and they are playing more, they are going to have an increase in confidence and feel better about themselves, rather than playing less minutes for Man United, for example.",
      "\"When you are at Man United, you have to earn those minutes like Bruno Fernandes who has done incredibly well. I think it is too easy to probably say that.\" When asked if getting away from the British media storm is also beneficial for players leaving the club, McTominay said it is a factor but perhaps not the main reason.",
      "The midfielder added: \"There are some players who leave and who we don’t speak about so much. But there are players who everybody speaks about so it depends on the individual and for me I think it is too easy an excuse to blame Man United as a club because when I was there, they did everything for me.",
      "\"They helped me with nutrition, they helped me with training, they helped me tactically - whoever the manager is. Everything is put there for you to succeed. It is not like they don’t give you certain things which other clubs do.",
      "\"So the myth they go away and become better players comes down to confidence. If you go away and you are playing every single game and you score and you score again, people start speaking [about you and] you feel good about yourself and you want to continue in that way.\"",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",

      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Kobbie Mainoo to force his way into the Manchester United team, rather than exploring other opportunities amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo's future at United has been the subject of debate since the summer. The England international asked to leave the club on loan towards the end of the transfer window, but United didn't sanction the move.",
      "The 20-year-old has played just 11 Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this season, all coming off the bench. His only start in this campaign came in the EFL Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, sparked controversy for wearing a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth. Mainoo came on with under 30 minutes left, his third-longest runout in the league this season, in a thriller at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo-Hames posted the image on his Instagram page, and it has led to more questions about the midfielder's future and attitude. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane labelled the stunt idiotic and urged Mainoo to work to get into the squad.",
      "\"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane added on Mainoo's future at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\"",
      "Despite the noise around Mainoo, Amorim has refused to say whether a loan moan would be sanctioned. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",

However, he would still not be available for the Manchester derby on January 17 as that date falls on the third-placed playoff - which Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",

      "South Africa and Algeria, both of whom have qualified for next year's World Cup, are expected to reach the quarter-finals, while Tunisia, another World Cup participant, is predicted to miss out on the knockout stages.",
      "Amorim is going to have to find a solution with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui out for the foreseeable future and former United defender Paul Parker believes it will be a very difficult task.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.\"",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's famous brother made a bold statement against Ruben Amorim by donning a controversial T-shirt at Manchester United's Premier League match against Bournemouth – marking yet another instance of the midfielder's celebrity sibling stirring things up at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo has found himself out of favour with manager Amorim amidst speculation of a possible departure in January. The England international has been absent from the starting eleven for all of United's 16 league games this season, his only start being in the Red Devils' humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old appeared to have the world at his feet following a standout 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, during which he netted the decisive goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and became an integral part of the England team that reached the Euros final.",
      "However, since Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, things have taken a turn for the worse for the Stockport-born academy product, with United icon Paul Scholes among those advising Mainoo to leave his childhood club in pursuit of more playing time. Reports suggest that Mainoo was eager to move to Napoli over the summer but had his request denied.",
      "Despite his limited game time, the young player received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he came on for Casemiro just after the hour mark during United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. However, post-match attention swiftly shifted to a provocative comment made by his brother at the side of the pitch.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was spotted in the front row sporting a black T-shirt bearing the message \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", a move with the potential to exacerbate an already tense situation. The act has divided United's fanbase, with some accusing Mainoo's relative of unnecessary provocation, while others see it as a legitimate protest.",
      "Mainoo's elder sibling may be a familiar face to many – the fashion model and influencer featured on the 2019 series of popular reality TV show Love Island and has since garnered over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "His name will also resonate within Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo disclosed that his brother's time on Love Island had resulted in him being given an unusual moniker.",
      "He stated: \"My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. He's been doing so since I was like 16.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs has urged Kobbie Mainoo to “have patience” given his current role at the club, but admits many feel he should be playing more often.",
      "Mainoo has not had the role he’d have expected at United this season. In the last couple of seasons, he was playing semi-regularly, but this term he has played just 212 minutes in the Premier League and is yet to start.",
      "It’s evident that Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are the favoured midfield pair, and Mainoo knows he’s never going to displace the former.",
      "The suggestion for months has been that he wants to leave United in search of better opportunities, and the latest report suggested his relationship with the club is ‘at breaking point’ as he attempts to find his way out.",
      "But United legend Giggs has urged patience from Mainoo, after his former team-mates Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt suggested he should leave.",
      "He told Metro: “I can see where the lads [Scholes and Butt] are coming from.",
      "“As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United. It’s like a striker. You don’t see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult.",
      "“We all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient. He’s still young, he’s still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I’d like to see him stay.”",
      "Giggs does feel manager Ruben Amorim has shown a willingness to pick young players, though.",
      "He said: [Ayden] Heaven has played in some really tough games lately at centre-half, which isn’t easy. So you are seeing the manager picking a 19-year-old. Recently, Shea Lacey was on the bench, who is only 18. So the manager has played young players.",
      "“But it depends on what the manager sees every day. Because I was given a chance when I was younger. I always give young players a chance because they’ll never let you down and will do exactly what you say.",
      "“United have got a massive history of academy players coming through, but they’ve got to be good enough. They’ve got to be good enough. You can’t just have a philosophy of playing young players who aren’t good enough. That can’t happen.",
      "“So that filters down below the first team. That’s the recruitment, the players who are playing in the youth team, playing in the reserves or the 21s, whether they be local lads or players from around the world.”",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is open to a permanent move away from Old Trafford as he doesn’t see a future at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United would be willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave permanently in January if they receive an ‘exceptional’ offer.",
      "Manchester United’s youngsters are having ‘tantrums’ by posting images of themselves with trophies on Instagram. Disgusting.",
      "Roy Keane has told Kobbie Mainoo he has to prove Ruben Amorim “wrong” at Manchester United, but what his “idiot of a brother” did of late doesn’t help things.",
      "Chelsea ‘will sign’ at least one midfielder in 2026 as a report has detailed their previous interest in a pair of expensive Premier League stars.",

      "Every summer, as soon as the last competitive ball is kicked, football turns into a glossy travelling circus. Clubs criss-cross the globe in search of broadcast exposure, commercial partnerships and, increasingly, the kind of international branding that even mega-corps like Amazon and Google might think was a bit much.",
      "The modern pre-season tour has become a pillar of elite football’s economy. Yet as the miles stretch further, the environmental cost grows heavier. The contradiction is now impossible to ignore: the sport’s most aggressively globalised tradition is also one of its biggest carbon headaches.",
      "The distances involved are staggering. Manchester United‘s 2023 tour, for example, included stops in Edinburgh, Oslo, New Jersey, San Diego, Houston and Las Vegas. According to publicly available flight data for comparable routes, such a journey easily exceeds 20,000 kilometres of air travel. Long-haul flights remain one of football’s most carbon-intensive activities, with aviation consistently identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a major emissions source.",
      "Find out where your team ranks in the Pledgeball table!",
      "United are hardly alone. Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool regularly venture to the United States. Spurs and Newcastle visited Australia barely minutes after the 2023-24 season finished, a single trip that – based on standard aviation emissions calculations for London-Melbourne return flights – produced several tonnes of CO₂ per person, before factoring in staff, equipment and internal travel.",
      "Clubs argue, often fairly, that these tours are commercial imperatives. The Premier League’s overseas broadcasting deals now dwarf domestic packages and international fan engagement translates directly into revenue. There is also a strategic logic: the United States and Southeast Asia are enormous growth markets. As long as sponsors and rights-holders prioritise global visibility, clubs will feel compelled to keep hopping across continents. Put simply, the machine pays too well to slow down.",
      "But the climate reality is moving faster than football’s commercial model. The United Nations Environment Programme has repeatedly highlighted the disproportionate emissions from international sport travel, while UEFA and FIFA’s own sustainability reports acknowledge travel as the single largest contributor to tournament footprints. The contradiction is baked into the structure of elite football. Clubs publicly commit to net-zero strategies, yet continue participating in a pre-season system designed to maximise miles, not minimise emissions.",
      "Some clubs are beginning to take tentative steps toward a different model. Brighton & Hove Albion have opted for more Europe-based pre-seasons in recent years, reducing long-haul flights while still accessing competitive opponents. Brentford have explored hybrid approaches, mixing local training camps with short-haul travel. FC Copenhagen, one of the more progressive clubs in Scandinavia, have publicly discussed avoiding unnecessary long-distance travel outside major competitions. These decisions are often framed as performance-oriented – shorter travel equals better recovery – but the environmental benefits are obvious.",
      "Did you know, 100,000 tonnes of sportswear ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone?",
      "A handful of clubs have experimented with centralised training hubs, a concept borrowed from American sports. Instead of flying from city to city for friendlies, teams gather in a single region or country, reducing the number of long-haul flights required. It is not a perfect solution, but it is measurably better than zig-zagging across continents. Another emerging idea is the “festival” model: several clubs gathering in one location for a mini-tournament, cutting down on both miles and logistical complexity. The Premier League Summer Series in the United States has even inadvertently demonstrated this, grouping fixtures within a relatively contained region to reduce internal travel.",
      "The conversation is also shifting at governing-body level. UEFA’s 2030 environmental strategy stresses travel reduction and more efficient scheduling, though it stops short of regulating club tours. FIFA have commissioned sustainability studies for the expanded Club World Cup, which itself required enormous global travel. For all the talk of responsibility, binding restrictions remain rare. Football seldom limits what boosts revenue.",
      "The science, however, is unequivocal. Aviation emissions are among the most damaging forms of climate impact and long-haul flights generate significantly more CO₂ per passenger-kilometre than most other forms of transport. While clubs often offset flights through tree-planting schemes or certified credits, many climate researchers argue that offsets cannot substitute genuine emissions reductions. The most effective solution remains the simplest: fly less.",
      "This is where football’s commercial priorities clash with its environmental aspirations. Clubs promote recycled kits, solar panels, electric mowers and waste-reduction drives – programmes that are valuable, genuine and necessary. But none of them match the scale of emissions produced by a two-week global tour involving tens of thousands of kilometres in the air. It is the sustainability equivalent of bragging about reusable water bottles while taking a private jet to work.",
      "Still, this issue is not unsolvable. Football has reinvented itself before, sometimes dramatically, when commercial logic demanded it. The same machinery that built pre-season tours into a global brand vehicle could just as easily retool them into a lower-carbon model – if governing bodies, sponsors and clubs decide the reputational upside is worth it. As climate expectations tighten across every sector, that moment may be coming sooner than football anticipates.",
      "Until then, the sport’s most glamorous summer ritual remains one of its dirtiest secrets. The crowds, the content and the commercial gains will continue, but the climate cost will grow heavier each year.",
      "In an era when football increasingly markets itself as a vehicle for social betterment, its love affair with long-haul summer travel remains the one area in which the industry most clearly refuses to look in the mirror.",

      "Thomas Frank has many problems to try and solve at Spurs, but one that may be heading his way is as simple and stark as the optics of vast blocks ...",

      "The Reds are well-stocked up front with Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak, but they are nowhere near as strong in wide positions, and this situation has been made worse by Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo’s disappointing form.",
      "Semenyo certainly fits the Liverpool mould for what they want from wingers, and he is also capable of playing on either flank.",
      "This signing would be a significant boost for Liverpool, especially if Salah leaves, but the centre-back department remains a more pressing concern for Slot due to a lack of options and the declines suffered by Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Marc Guehi, as he was in the summer, is the most obvious fix to this problem, but Liverpool could suffer more disappointment regarding this transfer in the winter.",
      "After Liverpool messed around in the summer, the world is Guehi’s oyster, so he would be foolish to accept a move in January and give up a potentially massive signing-on fee at the end of the season. So they will likely have to settle for Semenyo as their only marquee signing in the winter, which is not to be sniffed at.",
      "As for the other clubs, there have been murmurs about Arsenal doing a bit of business to ease their injury issues, though this “problem” cannot be used as an excuse for potentially another failed Premier League title challenge.",
      "This is also the case because it seems like there will be no notable departees as Mikel Arteta slams the exit door shut, preventing Gabriel Jesus, Ethan Nwaneri, Myles Lewis-Skelly and co. from moving for more game time.",
      "So with Arsenal already having the most complete squad in the Premier League, they have no real need to enter the market in January and surely won’t unless their injury issues suddenly worsen.",
      "Man City, too, are unlikely to do anything regarding incomings, though they are probably second to Liverpool in the running for Semenyo.",
      "Semenyo would obviously be a great addition, but they already have Jeremy Doku in Semenyo’s natural position. His performances have ranged from good to exceptional this season, so they are covered.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Tottenham plummet and Villa soar",
      "But unlike City and Arsenal, Spurs are in a far weaker position with their options in the final third.",
      "Thomas Frank’s side are said to be pulling out all of the stops to sign Semenyo, but this will likely ultimately fail to sign the winger.",
      "Instead, as David Ornstein has mentioned, it is foreseeable that they return for Man City star Savinho as an alternative after targeting him in the summer, with the winger currently only a bit-part player at the Etihad.",
      "And finally, Manchester United’s supposed interest is not a shock as they lingered in the summer before signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha instead of spending £80m on Semenyo.",
      "Man Utd certainly could do with Semenyo as they are already too reliant on Mbeumo and Cunha, but Liverpool are ahead of their rivals in the pecking order for good reason.",
      "So with Semenyo likely heading elsewhere, Man Utd’s window should be more low-key, with potentially only one in and one out.",
      "This would be in the midfield department, with a loan for Kobbie Mainoo said to be dependent on Man Utd signing a replacement, who will be a Conor Gallagher or a Ruben Neves, before getting their chequebook out for Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and/or Adam Wharton in the summer.",
      "Now, feel free to hibernate for the entire January transfer window, because you already know which transfers will and won’t happen involving five of the Big Six. You’re welcome…",
      "Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah could leave in the January transfer window if Antoine Semenyo arrives at Anfield from Bournemouth, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United want to sign Antoine Semenyo from Premier League rivals AFC Bournemouth as they have ‘doubts’ about a current star.",
      "Man City have reportedly leapt ahead of Premier League rivals Liverpool and Man Utd in the race to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth in January.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided that they will ‘go all out’ for Liverpool and Manchester City target Antoine Semenyo in January.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd have “made contact” in the last 48 hours over a deal to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo.",
      "As we approach January and Man Utd in particular pledge to strip every non-elite Premier League club, we look at the biggest assets outside the traditional Big Six."

      "Andoni Iraola did sign Alex Jimenez, but he’s only 20 years old, so Smith has been called upon frequently this campaign. Sharing the right-back load is probably the way to go.",

      "Man City have leapt ahead of Premier League rivals Liverpool and Man Utd in the race to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth in January, according to reports.",
      "The Ghana international is in demand after impressing for the Cherries over the last couple of seasons.",
      "This term, Semenyo – who can play all over the front line – has contributed seven goals and three assists in 15 Premier League appearances for Andoni Iraola’s men.",
      "Liverpool have perhaps been the most heavily linked as they look for help to turn around their fortunes this season despite spending over £400m on new players in the summer transfer window.",
      "Man City, Man Utd, Tottenham and Arsenal have also been credited with interest in Semenyo – who will not be going to the Africa Cup of Nations as Ghana failed to qualify – as the winger has a £65m release clause in his contract in January.",
      "Speaking earlier this week, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed that Man Utd had joined the race and made contact to understand the situation.",
      "READ: Maresca ‘shock’ development, Amorim’s ‘handbrake’ problem and ‘woke’ Lineker’s incredible ‘revenge’ plan",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Antoine Semenyo’s situation is really heating up.",
      "“Tottenham have genuine and strong interest and are being very aggressive. But the final decision will depend on the player.",
      "“In the last 48 hours, both Manchester United and Manchester City made contact to understand the situation. The price is around £65 million.",
      "“Liverpool also called back in November, but they are now assessing their priorities, especially with the situation of Mo Salah, before deciding whether to move in January.",
      "“So there are several clubs involved. Tottenham are pushing hard, City and United are in contact, Liverpool are monitoring, and now the key factor will be the player’s decision.”",
      "And now talkSPORT have claimed that Man City ‘have held talks’ with Semenyo over a potential move to the Etihad Stadium in the January transfer window.",

      "Liverpool, Man Utd and Tottenham are also ‘actively pursuing January deals’ while Arsenal are ‘open to a move if they offload a winger next month, although the Gunners are expecting a quiet transfer window’.",
      "The report adds: ‘City have stolen a march on their top-flight rivals by opening talks with Semenyo two weeks before the winter window opens.’",
      "After Semenyo scored in Bournemouth’s 4-4 draw with Man Utd at Old Trafford last weekend, Iraola praised the 25-year-old, he said: “Antoine is playing well.",
      "“The other day he scored also, [but it was] disallowed by nothing offside. I think he’s been a threat for us.",
      "“Today, he showed also personality. Good aerially, winning duels and I think he’s in a good moment. I don’t analyse Antoine just because he hasn’t scored last, I don’t know how many games.",
      "“I think it’s about team performance, how much he helps us. And the same with all the others.",
      "“Evanilson had scored just one goal before today, but he was playing well and he was being a threat and we trust him and it’s the same.”",

      "Five of the Big Six want Antoine Semenyo, but who will sign him and what will the other four sides do after missing out? Here’s what will *definitely* happen…",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided that they will ‘go all out’ for Liverpool and Manchester City target Antoine Semenyo in January.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd have “made contact” in the last 48 hours over a deal to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo.",
      "As we approach January and Man Utd in particular pledge to strip every non-elite Premier League club, we look at the biggest assets outside the traditional Big Six."

      "Interestingly, Ferguson did not mention Sesko as he has made a slow start to this campaign, but he thinks Lammens has “made a difference” for this new team this term.",
      "“I think the appointment of the goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] has made a difference,” Ferguson added.",
      "“He’s young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player. United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped.",

This move would allow Manchester United to free up a strategic roster spot and reduce their wage bill, enabling them to make an immediate impact signing this winter. Amorim is looking for a specific profile that can integrate into his characteristic double pivot and rotate with figures of the calibre of Casemiro.

      "When asked whether the Man Utd target was worth the £100m quoted, Harewood added: “He is definitely one of those players. If someone said that and put that price tag, with the money that’s going on in the game over the last couple of years, he is definitely worth the price tag and I think he will go on and do really well at whatever club he is at.",

      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though, but spangling Tottenham will have gone down enormously well with his boss for sure.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "But derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting, and the reality is that Howe and Newcastle remain for now behind Tottenham in the league, and that is not the place any self-respecting club should currently find themselves, all things considered.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A pair of subsequent wins cool the immediate temperatures but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. We don’t know, but we’d certainly contend he’s unlucky to be second favourite at this time on current form.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options that prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",

      "Last week, when quizzed on not using academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, Amorim used Harry Amass and Chido Obi as examples, suggesting they were not at the level required for United at the moment.",
      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in the U21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",
      "\"It's the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to me. That's the way we can solve things.",
      "\"We need to change as a club.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man Utd. Sometimes you play for Man Utd and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man Utd. That was my point, but let's move on.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",
      "He repeated that word, 'entitlement'.",
      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",
      "Amass this season has continued his development at Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season - a loan the club felt would seriously improve his future prospects at the club, especially his defensive qualities.",
      "Obi - having watched him multiple times for the U21s, still has plenty of improvement to go with coaches in the academy demanding more in his work off the ball and build-up play.",
      "But both - as well as other players last season - received opportunities because of the multiple injuries to the squad while also prioritising the Europa League. This is what Amorim tried to explain last week and he expanded on today.",
      "There will be a high chance for those in the academy like Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher to potentially impress in the next month and I expect a few on the bench on Sunday with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire injured, Casemiro suspended and Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui away for AFCON.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has discussed his loyalty to Manchester United, saying he believes the club can return to former glories and win multiple trophies.",
      "The Man Utd captain appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, which was recorded before his explosive interview with Portuguese TV channel Canal 11 was published, and also revealed he stayed at the club despite two offers to leave.",
      "Fernandes told Canal 11 he was \"hurt\" that the club were open to offloading him to Saudi Arabia during the summer.",
      "But speaking to Ferdinand, the midfielder says the club can win regular silverware, and he would not have stayed as long as he has if he did not believe it was possible.",
      "Fernandes said: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could.",

When we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I hope everyone at the club is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"I'm very aware that I could have gone a different path and probably won more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. Nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.",

      "\"If that was not the aim then yes, I wouldn't have stayed here, but because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be and where I want the club to be, that's why I came to the club in the first place. If I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.\"",
      "Fernandes is often the focal point of any Man Utd performance, whether that is having a hand in the goals or his passionate on-field reactions.",
      "That has often been the case since his arrival at Old Trafford in January 2020, with Fernandes also offering an insight into how his team-mates help him maintain the club's standards.",
      "He said: \"As a captain, obviously you're going to get more attention, stick and everything. But that comes with the club also - it's not just by the armband.",
      "\"I haven't changed the way I was for the way I'm now because I've got the armband. When Erik [Ten Hag] chose me to be the captain, he knew what type of captain I was. I know I lead by example, because I do everything is needed to do on the training pitch. I train as hard as I can.",
      "\"I can moan as much as people think, but I run more than I moan - I'm pretty sure of that. So I think I'm still an example of the way things have to be done for the club. The standard.",
      "\"Then I think I treat everyone as I would like to be treated and when I talk about everyone, I don't see anyone below me. For me, everyone's in the same level. It could be me, it could be the people that serve us at the restaurant, the chefs, the nutritionists, the staff.",
      "\"No one is below and no one is above me. Obviously, apart from the bosses, the manager and the other ones that are above the managers, but still, the managers, they say 'guys, I'm in the same level as you, I just have more responsibility and I have to take the decisions. That's where I'm above you'.",
      "\"And as a captain, I have sometimes to make decisions on things. But we have a leadership group that is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Heaton], [Noussair] Mazroui and Diogo [Dalot].",
      "\"We then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro and Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "\"From that six [of the leadership group], the message has to be clear for everyone else. We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone.",
      "\"But that's not just me, it's the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, 'guys, this is what we're going to do and mandatory for us. This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club'.\"",
      "There has been plenty of change at Man Utd in the almost six years since Fernandes joined. He has played under six managers - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and currently, Ruben Amorim, on a permanent basis, with interim spells for Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "There has been silverware, including the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, as well as success - and a lack thereof - in Europe.",
      "On what has changed since he first walked into the dressing room in 2020, Fernandes said: \"There were a lot of experienced players. You had David [De Gea], Nema [Nemanja Matic], Juan [Mata].",
      "\"Paul [Pogba] was already a big player. Jesse [Lingard] was a big player at the time already, you had Rashy [Marcus Rashford]. Then we'd come with a mix of youngest.",
      "\"I think everything has changed in the world of football in the last, not just five years, but also the years I've been in football. Nowadays, the young ones put the music [on] in the dressing room.",
      "\"But I really like the mix we have in the dressing room [now] because it makes me feel very young, the energy they have, the way we involve everyone together, and not looking at age difference, who's been here longer, who's been here less.",
      "\"We don't have that thing of who's more important, who's less important... The energy is very good.\"",

      "Friday 19 December 2025 13:26, UK",
      "He may be in his third season at Old Trafford, but it finally seems that Manchester United fans are starting to see the best of Mason Mount.",
      "Question marks were raised when Erik ten Hag paid £55 million for the then-maligned Chelsea star, especially given his fitness concerns and lack of obvious role in the Dutchman's system.",
      "After early struggles, he seems to have found his feet under Ruben Amorim. Earmarked as an early favourite of the Portuguese, he currently finds himself on his most consistent run in the team at the Theatre of Dreams, already equalling his previous best seasonal goals tally at the club.",
      "For many, Mount has become a focal point in how Amorim wants his United side to play. They clearly get better results when he is in the team - the Red Devils have lost just once in the Premier League when he starts, compared to three times when he doesn't. But the numbers show that doesn't necessarily equate to better performances.",
      "Amorim has often insisted that it doesn't matter in what formation his teams line up in. What matters is the finer details as to how the players operate within it.",
      "\"The most important thing is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past. We need time, but we have to win time. To win time is to win games. But the most important thing is identity,\" were his exact words when he was first hired in November 2024.",
      "While he hasn't spoken out on the specifics of what those principles are, history shows that Amorim's teams focus on a possession-based style built around shorter passes and a high defensive line that enables an assertive pressing approach.",
      "On the surface, that sounds like a way of playing that would suit Mount's strengths. Yet when he is in the team, those characteristics seem to falter.",
      "It has been a 50/50 between games started and games where the Englishman has either come off the bench or not featured. When he starts, United not only pick up more points, but they score more goals (2.25 per game vs 1.50) and are far more efficient when finishing their 'big' chances (1.38 goals vs 0.75).",
      "That points towards a positive impact, which can't be denied. Look further though, and you see that with Mount in the team, United tend to move further away from the fundamentals associated with Amorim.",
      "Though the number of chances created when Mount starts is significantly higher, the number of 'big chances' is lower, suggesting that United have far more low xG efforts built up in these games, rather than creating clearer goalscoring opportunities more frequently.",
      "Some of this lack of higher-quality chances can perhaps be attributed to the fact that there is also a major shift towards a more direct style of play when Mount starts compared to when he doesn't.",
      "With him in the team, United average more long passes. They also attempt 10 per cent fewer passes in the final third and pull off 17 per cent less.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, in games where Mount starts, United win possession back in their attacking third less too. Given that the narrative is that Mount's energy aids United in the press, you'd expect the opposite to be the case.",
      "That is not to say that Mount is the sole reason for the drop-offs.",
      "As an individual, he ranks sixth in the team in chances created, fourth in final third passes attempted and completed, only ninth in long passes and second in possession won in the attacking third among the squad.",
      "By those metrics, you can see that he is doing what you would expect him to do based on Amorim's requirements. Yet, as a collective, United are moving away from Amorim's principles more often when Mount is in the team.",
      "Is that a criticism? If anything, it's the opposite. Much has been said of Amorim's reluctance to adapt his way of playing in order to find success, but the data proves that there is flexibility to be played with.",
      "It is more interesting though that a player who was believed to be the epitome of what Amorim needed from his squad has highlighted that his success is coming when he steers away from the methodology that he was so steadfast in bringing to Old Trafford.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League card and tips up a 13/1 weekend treble with Sky Bet.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "Manchester United will only consider selling Kobbie Mainoo in January if they receive an exceptional offer.",
      "The club do not want to sell, and are equally reluctant to see him leave on loan.",
      "A string of Premier League clubs are interested in him, but only a handful could afford a permanent deal.",
      "What is impossible to predict, however, is how the player himself might react - and how that might impact the club's decision-making, if Mainoo remains on the fringes of the first team.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and his brother posed for photographs at Old Trafford on Monday night wearing a t-shirt which read \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", which has since gone viral on social media.",
      "There were loud cheers from the home support when the young midfielder came on against Bournemouth with half an hour to go.",
      "Mainoo is clearly still very popular with United fans, and he is clearly frustrated by the lack of game time, struggling to adjust to a fall from grace since he was a regular under Erik ten Hag and a starter at the heart of the England midfield for last summer's European Championship final in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo won the last of his 10 England caps in September 2024 and, ahead of next summer's World Cup, is yet to feature under new England head coach Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Apart from playing the whole of the second half against Burnley back in August, he hasn't featured for more than half an hour in any Premier League for United game since. His only 90-minute outing came in the ill-fated defeat at Grimsby Town, which saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round.",
      "But Amorim has been very clear that he doesn't doubt Mainoo's talent - rather, the head coach says it is a straight choice right now between him and the United captain.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders,\" Amorim said. \"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "When asked if he rates Mainoo highly, Amorim added: \"Of course. Like everyone else.\"",
      "It makes no financial sense for United's hierarchy to send Mainoo out on loan.",
      "Because of his route through the United age-groups he is on a relatively modest wage compared to other players in the first team, and so there is little incentive to have his salary covered by another team.",
      "Furthermore, if he were to go on loan next month, United would have to replace him to provide extra cover in their midfield for the remainder of the season. That is likely to mean a bigger bill to bring in a new player who would be less familiar than Mainoo with the United environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Roy Keane has urged Mainoo to fight for his place at Manchester United.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, former United captain Keane said: \"Are you telling me he can't sit there for another six months?",
      "\"He might think the manager might be gone in the summer, one or two of the senior players might be gone.",
      "\"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if you're not getting a chance, we've all had to do it at different levels.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is look at a manager and go 'I'll prove you wrong'.",
      "\"Every day is your challenge to prove to the manager and when that manager is picking the team I'm going to train like a beast and when you're writing that team [as a manager] you're going to go, 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that… we shouldn't even be giving his brother the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.",
      "\"The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong,\" Keane added when talking about Mainoo being in competition with Fernandes for a place in Amorim's starting XI.",
      "\"Bruno might get injured. There was a chat about Bruno leaving in the summer. Bruno might leave next summer, so you bide your time as a young player.",
      "\"I've no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team.",
      "\"Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in ahead of Bruno' [your mindset should be], 'I'm going to prove you wrong'.\""

      "AFCON 2025 kicks off this weekend with those Premier League players involved having reported for duty with their national teams; Between the Lines examines which clubs are most and least impacted by the tournament",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Joe Watson",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Premier League players taking part in AFCON 2025 departed to join up with their national teams this week ahead of the tournament opener on Sunday, when hosts Morocco face Comoros.",
      "The players called up could be absent for over a month, with the final of the tournament scheduled for January 18. So which Premier League clubs will be the most and least impacted?",
      "Between the Lines drills into the numbers and looks at the challenge facing some clubs to adapt, including Manchester United.",
      "A total of 32 Premier League players are taking part in the tournament, representing 14 of the 24 competing nations.",
      "As shown in the graphic below, Sunderland are losing the most players with six. Their total is double that of any other Premier League club and the highest by any club across Europe's major leagues.",
      "It includes two players who have played important roles defensively in holding midfielder Noah Sadiki and left-back Reinildo.",
      "The pair have helped the Black Cats keep five clean sheets so far this season in the Premier League, the latest coming in Sunday's Wear-Tyne derby, during which they played the full 90 minutes.",
      "Manchester United are losing three players in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, as are Fulham, in Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey and Samuel Chukwuemeze, and Burnley, in Lyle Foster, Hannibal Mejbri and Axel Tuanzebe.",
      "Seven clubs are losing two players, including Manchester City, in Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri, with a further three clubs losing one player, including Liverpool in Mohamed Salah, who has departed having impressed off the bench against Brighton.",
      "Leaders Arsenal are one of six Premier League clubs not losing any players to the tournament.",
      "Losing players is one thing, losing important players is another.",
      "In terms of minutes played by players taking part in AFCON, Sunderland again come out as the worst-hit.",
      "Their six players called up to the tournament have played a combined 4,412 minutes in the Premier League this season. Sadiki and Reinildo account for around half that total, but Chemsdine Talbi and Bertrand Traore have also featured regularly.",
      "Fulham are next on the list in second, narrowly ahead of Manchester United in third, as both teams lose players with just over 3,000 Premier League minutes played.",
      "For the Cottagers, the biggest losses, in terms of minutes played, are Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey, both of whom represent Nigeria. For United, it's Cameroon's Mbeumo and Ivory Coast's Amad.",
      "Everton and West Ham are next in the rankings, with Ndiaye, Idrissa Gueye, Malick Diouf and Aaron Wan-Bissaka all regular starters who have played more than 1,000 Premier League minutes this season.",
      "While Sunderland will have to cope without crucial defensive players, other clubs will have to manage without vital attackers.",
      "Manchester United and Fulham are losing 11 goal involvements respectively with the departures of Mbeumo, Amad, Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze.",
      "Everton are next, losing eight, with six of them having come from Ndiaye, while Salah's involvement means Liverpool are losing seven, with the Egypt international having added his latest goal involvement with his assist off the bench in his last appearance before the tournament against Brighton.",
      "The clubs most impacted by AFCON have of course had time to prepare knowing which of their players would likely feature at the tournament well in advance.",
      "In Manchester United's case, did Monday's meeting with Bournemouth at Old Trafford hint at Amorim's plans?",
      "He is losing two players key to his preferred system in Amad and Mbeumo, who occupy the right wing-back and right-sided No 10 spots respectively in his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "But the 4-4 draw with Andoni Iraola's side, during which Amad and Mbeumo made their final appearances before the tournament, saw an unprecedented change of shape from the head coach.",
      "For the first time at United, Amorim switched from a back three to a back four, a significant tactical adjustment which may be a response to losing Amad and Mbeumo for a busy run of fixtures.",
      "How Amorim adapts is just one of many questions as Premier League clubs contend with their AFCON absentees.",
      "Can Sunderland maintain their brilliant start?",
      "Will Salah's prolonged absence help or hinder Liverpool?",
      "And could Arsenal capitalise on having no players involved?",
      "We explain why Bruno Fernandes is this season's biggest Premier League game-changer - and why nobody can match Mohamed Salah over the last 15 years.",
