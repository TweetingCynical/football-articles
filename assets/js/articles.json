      "Manchester United favourite Cristiano Ronaldo was sent a birthday message on social media from his former club - even though he left Old Trafford in acrimonious circumstances",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo may have left Manchester United for the second time under a cloud back in November 2022, the multi-time Ballon d'Or winner still holds the club dear to his heart.",
      "Ronaldo, 39, returned to Old Trafford back in the summer of 2021 after spending six years playing under Sir Alex Ferguson at the start of his career, but his second coming was short-lived.",
      "Despite plundering 24 goals in 38 matches in all competitions during the 2021/22 campaign, Ronaldo was given a reduced bit-part role following the arrival of Erik ten Hag before their relationship completely disintegrated.",
      "Ronaldo would end up terminating his contract early after reaching a mutual agreement with United back in November 2022. However, his association with the club remains to this day and the Premier League outfit were quick to send a message of support to the Portuguese superstar on his 39th birthday.",
      "The message from United, which was shared on Instagram alongside the 'Viva Ronaldo' chant, was given a seal of approval by the man himself, who liked the post on his own account.",
      "Ronaldo, who currently plays for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, claimed he felt \"betrayed\" by the club and slammed Ten Hag during an explosive interview with Piers Morgan shortly before his exit was confirmed after growing disillusioned with life at Old Trafford under the Dutchman.",
      "Given the nature of his comments, his departure came as no surprise when it was announced a few days later. Reacting to the news, Ronaldo issued a statement which read: \"Following conversations with Manchester United we have mutually agreed to end our contract early.",
      "\"I love Manchester United and I love the fans, that will never ever change. However, it feels like the right time for me to seek a new challenge. I wish the team every success for the remainder of the season and for the future.\"",
      "Since quitting the Premier League, Ronaldo has plundered 44 goals in 50 games in Saudi Arabia for Al-Nassr, who are currently vying for the Saudi Pro League title. They are currently second, seven points behind Al-Hilal, who are unbeaten so far this term.",
      "In total, Ronaldo scored 145 goals for Manchester United in the 345 appearances he made across his two spells at the club."

      "Former England captain and Man Utd defender Rio Ferdinand says it's still 'inevitable they would get hammered by people'",
      "Rio Ferdinand says football is still not set up to provide the support a Premier League star would need to be openly gay.",
      "The former England captain added that although attitudes have changed for the better in recent decades, top flight male players would face abuse for coming out. Rio, 45, who used homophobic language in the past, also said that what was classed as dressing room banter in his playing days was brutal.",
      "Asked why there are no openly gay players in the top flight in England, Rio said: “I don’t think football has put together the infrastructure for a safe space for a person to come out. There’s a lot of uncontrollable like fans, social media, forums, where it’s inevitable that they’ll get hammered by people.”",
      "For a documentary fronted by TV presenter Rylan Clark, Rio is quizzed about jokingly calling DJ Chris Moyles a “faggot” on Radio 1 in 2006. Rylan asks: “It got you in a little bit of hot water?”",
      "Rio replies: “It didn’t at the time. I think Ofcom got two complaints. That was the way the changing room and we were. It was brutal. If you were to jump back in time and be in that changing room, the language used then would [now] be getting people cancelled left, right and centre. It was seen as normal.”",
      "The former Manchester United and Leeds defender, who played from the mid-90s to 2015, adds: “I’ve been fortunate because my sister is gay. I made her listen to [the Radio 1 clip]. And I was… embarrassed. I’ll do everything I can to make her feel comfortable and acknowledge I was part of a culture that was very wrong, and actually society wasn’t where it is today.”",
      "Rylan, 35, says it “doesn’t make sense” that there are no openly gay footballers in the Premier League. He then meets former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton player Thomas Hitzlsperger, who is openly gay in retirement. The German international says he never considered coming out during his career because he was “terrified” of the consequences. Thomas, 41, said: “It was the dressing room.",
      "“We had conversations in the dressing room, and somebody started a conversation saying, ‘What if we had a gay team-mate? What would you do?’. Then suddenly, players had their opinion on it. Some of the comments were really terrifying. I thought, ‘If they know I am gay would they really do this, what they just said like, “I wouldn’t want to shower with that player, I wouldn’t want to get changed with a player”?’.",
      "“More things were said which I wouldn’t want to say in public. So it wasn’t the media. It wasn’t the fans. It was the dressing room. Every [day] you change with the players, you shower. And if somebody is uncomfortable, you unsettle the whole dressing room. It has an effect on training and games. So that responsibility I didn’t want to take.” After talking to openly gay players in the lower leagues and the women’s game, Rylan says he hopes coming out won’t be a big deal for Premier League stars in future.",
      "He adds: “I cannot wait until we get to a point where I haven’t got to do this documentary.”"

      "Manchester United flop Donny van de Beek has had to deal with another career set-back as loan club Eintracht Frankfurt have left the Dutchman out of their Europa Conference League squad",
      "Despite only joining Eintracht Frankfurt from parent club Manchester United last month, Donny van de Beek has already been omitted from the German side's Europa Conference League squad.",
      "The Netherlands international upped sticks to Frankfurt for the remainder of the campaign at the start of the January transfer window. It had been hoped that the loan switch would kickstart a flatlining career after more than three years of sitting on the bench for the Red Devils.",
      "However, Van de Beek has hardly hit the ground running with the Bundesliga outfit. In just his third appearance for the club, he was hauled off at half-time before being left on the bench for the entirety of Saturday's 2-0 defeat by FC Koln.",
      "Things have since gone from bad to worse for Van de Beek, who has been left out of Eintracht's 25-man squad for the Europa Conference League knockout rounds. UEFA's rules state that clubs can only make three changes to their team for the next stage of the competition.",
      "Sasa Kalajdzic, Hugo Ekitike and Philipp Max - other January signings made by the club have been named instead of Van de Beek. Though it didn't cost much in terms of a loan fee to bring the Dutchman to the club, Eintracht are covering the bulk of his £125,000-a-week wages.",
      "Within his loan contract is an option to buy for a fee that would pocket United just shy of £12million, marking a steep loss considering they forked out £40m to sign him from Ajax back in 2020. In that time, he's managed to make less than 30 starts, meaning he will forever be viewed as one of the most underwhelming Red Devils signings of recent memory.",
      "Speaking in December, Van de Beek was clearly champing at the bit to force through a United exit because of the lack of game-time on offer. His prolonged misery under Erik ten Hag came as a surprise to some, given it was the man that currently occupies the Old Trafford hot-seat that got the best out of the midfielder at Ajax.",
      "Discussing his United failings, Van de Beek explained: \"I had hoped for more games when I was playing well, so you get into a flow. But you have to deal with more factors.",
      "\"Everyone wants to make United successful again, but they are not succeeding - and it's hard to put your finger on it. But I am bursting with energy now that I am fit again and I am really training like an animal. The time has come to make a different choice.\"",
      "A different choice was made, but it has unfortunately produced the same outcome for Van de Beek."

      "Rasmus Hojlund has been starting to make a name for himself after a £72m summer move to Manchester United, and the Danish international as given his opinion on the club's greats",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund found a spot for Cristiano Ronaldo in his dream United five-a-side team, but there was no space for all-time top scorer Wayne Rooney",
      "Ronaldo had two stints at Old Trafford, winning the Ballon d'Or and Champions League in his first. The Portugal star was less successful in his second stint, and left by mutual agreement before his contract with the Old Trafford club was up.",
      "Denmark international Hojlund was brought in over the summer to fill the gap left by Ronaldo's departure. The former Atalanta man started slowly after his £72m summer switch, but has found form since the turn of the year with four goals in as many games.",
      "Hojlund was a United supporter as a boy, starting to follow the club in the first decade of the century, and this has been reflected in his picks for his five-aside team. With only five spots available, though, some big names had to miss out.",
      "Speaking to The United Stand, Hojlund made goalkeeper and compatriot Peter Schmeichel his first pick. \"I need to put Peter in goal. Peter is Danish,\" he said. \"Peter won everything here. Peter is a legend here but is also a legend in Denmark because he won the Euros for us.\"",
      "With only one spot in defence, Hojlund was made to choose between Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. In the end, the English half of the 2007-08 Champions League winning partnership got the nod.",
      "\"I need to put Rio in there because he's very memorable to me,\" Hojlund continued. \"I would love to put Vidic in there, but I can only have one defender.",
      "Only a handful of United players won the Champions League in both 1999 and 2008, and two of them make it into Hojlund's team. Both are academy graduates who spent their entire careers at Old Trafford, with Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes getting the nod in the midfield spots",
      "\"I want to put Ryan Giggs in there, Paul Scholes and then Cristiano up front,\" Hojlund explained. That means no Rooney, and also no room for former United skipper Roy Keane, among others.",
      "Back in the summer, Hojlund told club media the 2008 Champions League final success was one of his first football memories that stuck with him. He also explained the role his dad played in getting him into football, leading to him choosing United as his team.",
      "\"My father pushed it over my head, and I started following everybody around the club and of course, I was very into Premier League football and everything around it,\" Hojlund said. “So, I kept watching, and of course, Cristiano [Ronaldo] was my idol when he was playing back then, so I kept following him and of course kept following Manchester United.”"

      "Eric Cantona wrote himself into the Manchester United history books through his five years under Sir Alex Ferguson, but he easily could have ended up at Liverpool",
      "Eric Cantona is a Manchester United legend, yet things could have been very different but for the decision of Liverpool manager Graeme Souness.",
      "Cantona arrived in England at Leeds in 1992 following a trial at Sheffield Wednesday and ended up at Old Trafford, where he became a mercurial hero under Sir Alex Ferguson. Those five eventful years at United came after he made a name for himself in his native France – both for his talent and his behaviour.",
      "And it was ultimately the latter of those characteristics which saw Souness decide against taking the risk. The Liverpool boss was offered the chance to sign Cantona, but instead went for what he perceived to be the safer option of Istvan Kozma, who arrived from Dunfermline for £300,000 in February 1992.",
      "Souness has since explained his thinking in rejecting Cantona. \"I was manager of Liverpool and we played Auxerre in the cup winners' cup and we lost 2-0 away, we came back and beat them 3-0,\" Souness explained on The Football Show in 2020. \"After the game, Terry Littlewood, who used to look after the players' lounge and my lounge, security-wise, knocked on my door and said there's a pal outside, he's a good friend of yours and he wants to speak to you.",
      "\"I said 'who is it?' and he said 'it's Michel Platini'. Not a close pal of mine, the only time I had come in contact with him was when I played against him when I was in Italy. He came in and said 'I've got a player for you, he's a real problem in France but he's really talented and he'd be perfect for your club'. I said 'look, Michel, I'm fighting fires here at the moment, I'm trying to get some people out of the door that are resisting, I'm fighting a dressing room here. The last thing I need is another controversial figure'.",
      "\"Eric of course then came over on trial with Sheffield Wednesday, then signed for Leeds and the rest is history. When he went to United, it was a young team and young players need someone like that on the pitch to look up to. I think Eric was certainly one of them.\"",
      "The story of Cantona at United is well-known – and the fact Kozma’s time at Liverpool is less well documented says a lot about how it went. The Hungary international only played 10 times for the Reds in the end, failing to make an impression at Anfield.",
      "The midfielder made his debut as a second-half substitute in a goalless draw at Ipswich Town in the FA Cup fifth round before a forgettable first start in a 3-0 defeat by Norwich. His first three starts for the club saw Liverpool fail to score a single goal.",
      "His crowning achievement came when he came on as a half-time substitute with the team 3-0 down against Chesterfield in the League Cup. To his credit, Kozma made a difference, setting up goals for Ronny Rosenthal and Mark Wright as Liverpool drew 4-4 in front of a measly crowd at Anfield.",
      "He stuck around for the 1992/93 season, without getting into the team, and was forced to leave at the end of the campaign when his lack of appearances meant he wasn’t granted a work permit. Kozma went back to Hungary to play for Ujpest and had a stint in Cyprus with APOEL before seeing out his career in his homeland.",
      "It wasn’t all bad. Although he didn’t play, Kozma was at Wembley for Liverpool’s FA Cup final win over Sunderland in May 1992 – and it made an impression on him. \"It was still the old Wembley and a full house,\" he recalled in 2021.",
      "\"We were sitting behind the bench. The next day we went home to Liverpool, a huge celebration began. First we were taken around the city on an open double decker bus where a lot of scarves were thrown at us. It was a huge experience. I still keep a few of the things.\"",

      "Majority owners the Glazer family have been unpopular with sections of the fanbase, some of whom have welcomed the arrival of British billionaire Ratcliffe. However, while future decisions are expected to be made with the input of the new investor, the Old Trafford plans are understood to predate his arrival.",
      "Results have picked up of late for United, who beat West Ham at Old Trafford on Sunday. It followed a dramatic midweek victory away to Wolves, ensuring back-to-back league wins for Erik ten Hag's side for the first time since November.",
      "The relationship between the Glazers and some fans hasn't been the best even when results were altogether more impressive last season, though. Now, a rise of five per cent across the board on season ticket prices are unlikely to improve that situation.",
      "Not only will fans have to pay more next season, a second successive annual increase, but some will be moved to new seats. According to The Mail, those in the Sir Bobby Charlton stand are due to be relocated to accommodate the families of players.",
      "Those in corporate seats will also face higher bills, with some forced to fork out an extra £500 per year. According to communication from United, the changes are designed to ensure the club \"operates on a sustainable basis and to support investment in the team and stadium\".",
      "United have regularly enjoyed attendances north of 70,000 this season, even with the club struggling in Europe and spending the entire league season outside the Champions League spots. Indeed, Sunday's match against West Ham represented their highest attendance of the campaign at 73,612.",
      "On the field, the late midweek drama at Wolves was followed by an altogether more comfortable win at Old Trafford on Sunday. Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring, getting among the goals for the fourth straight game, and Alejandro Garnacho struck twice in the second half after West Ham spurned chances to draw level.",
      "Ten Hag insisted he wouldn't be over-celebrating after his team's biggest home win of the season, but pointed to some of the positives. \"For today, we are pleased with it, but you need routines to get consistent performances,\" he said.",
      "\"So, you have to make decisions. You have to make decisions in a split second. And when every time you have to swap your team, you have to swap your centre-halves, you have to swap your back four, positioning the right full-back to the left full-back and then swap back again.",
      "\"All those adjustments, all those are rules and principles who they know. It's about looking at each other, taking the right decisions. Top football is about details, and when one detail doesn't work, and you concede goals, and then you're following the facts and we had that too much this season.\""

      "Former United manager Moyes has yet to record an away league win against his old club, though he did lead West Ham to a Carabao Cup victory at Old Trafford in 2021. Sunday's loss was a fourth straight defeat to nil in this fixture in the league, after 1-0 losses in each of the last three seasons.",
      "West Ham had chances to get on the scoresheet, with left-back Emerson spurning arguably the best chance shortly before Garnacho doubled United's lead. Speaking after the game, Moyes made it clear he didn't consider it a 3-0 game.",
      "\"No I don't think the scoreline was correct,\" the Scot told Match of the Day. \"Our performance in the main was much better. I am pleased with that but obviously not pleased with different aspects, we didn't finish chances. Overall we played better and our performance was better today.\"",
      "When asked about Emerson's miss, he said: \"That tells you it just was not going to be our day. They broke away and they shoot and it takes a big deflection and that makes it 2-0.",

Hopefully there's a wee bit of mitigating circumstances and hopefully the goals will start flowing in the coming weeks.\"",

      "West Ham have been without some key players in recent weeks, though they were able to welcome back Nayef Aguerd after the Morocco defender's AFCON exploits.

      "It says everything about United's failings that this was the first home league game this season they have won by more than one goal, victory lifting them up from eighth to sixth place. They may still be eight points off fourth spot, but with 15 games remaining, United have gathered some momentum as they continue to make a late and unlikely push for a Champions League spot.",

The ball fell into the path of Hojlund, who sent two opponents the wrong way with his quick movement, before burying an unstoppable shot past Alphonse Areola.",
      "Despite going ahead, United were unable to build on it and frustrated their fans with their willingness to sit on their lead and invite West Ham on to them. The visitors created a host of first-half chances but were unable to convert any of them and were dealt a blow when Areola, who had collided with team-mate Kurt Zouma in the first-half, did not emerge for the restart, replaced in goal by Lukasz Fabianski",
      "The Hammers had a chance to level three minutes after the restart, when a lapse in concentration from Harry Maguire allowed Emerson Palmieri to take possession and surge forward. Emerson chose to go it alone, despite options to his right, his decision proving to be the wrong one as he scuffed his shot high and wide.",
      "It proved a significant miss, with United doubling their lead within two minutes, a shot from Garnacho deflecting off Nayef Aguerd, giving Fabianski no chance.",

      "United lost Martinez with 20 minutes to go, the defender failing to recover after falling awkwardly minutes earlier when trying to shield the ball from Vladimir Coufal. Any hopes West Ham had of getting back into the game ended six minutes from time, when United counter-attacked, with substitute Scott McTominay setting up Garnacho for his second goal."

      "Hojlund bagged his first in the Boxing Day win over Aston Villa and the floodgates have since opened with the confidence flowing through him. The Dane's strike against the Hammers was that of a man who had total belief in his own ability.",
      "A number of his attacking colleagues have copped flack for failing to deliver this season, but Hojlund always showed enough to warrant patience and he's more than paying back that faith now, scoring in his last four league outings.",
      "Few things can be more frustrating than seeing your side impose themselves as an away outfit, only to get back on the bus with no points. That will be Moyes this evening with West Ham certainly showing why they've enjoyed such lofty heights this term.",
      "In the opening exchanges they showed ambition and were, for large parts, better than United, but simply couldn't take their opportunities. West Ham went into half-time enjoying the better of every stat, except the one that mattered.",
      "Harry Maguire presented Emerson with a golden opportunity to level early in the second-half, which he blazed over. Within 60 seconds United had doubled their lead thanks to a deflected Garnacho strike, all but killing West Ham's hopes.",
      "Youth has often provided a beacon of hope for those at United, even during the difficult times. Garnacho is among those to show he has the appetite to succeed at one of the world's biggest clubs and his strike made it 2-0 after 49 minutes as he reeled away in celebration.",
      "He was followed by Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo, the scorer of the winner against Wolves in midweek. The trio posed on the advertising boards with Old Trafford on its feet. They could prove to be three of the most crucial cogs at United for the next decade and beyond as they sat smiling cheek to cheek. Aged just 18, 19 and 21 - the future looks bright with those youngsters firing.",
      "It was all looking so good for the World Cup winner. Say what you want about the Argentine's size, but the bottomline is he's returned from a lengthy injury lay off and helped United win two games in the space of four days - something they've not achieved that often this season. He's slotted straight into the backline, forming a partnership with Maguire, whom he'd have hardly played with last term.",
      "However Martinez landed awkwardly when he was involved in a scuffle as he tried to usher the ball out of play. He went down clutching his knee with team-mates rushing over to check on him. Despite efforts to run it off the centre-half trudged off on 70 minutes with the look of a man who wasn't entirely convinced with the state of his fitness.",
      "Whenever Moyes returns to Old Trafford he must walk past the home dugout and wonder what might've been had he done things differently. As an away manager though he's still awaiting his first win in almost twenty visits.",
      "He was present for some landmark draws, particularly the 4-4 when he was manager of Everton that cost United the title in 2012. Wins though have eluded him with his Hammers side unable to press home a 1-0 advantage last term in the FA Cup. This season he'll have been buoyed by their performance, particularly in the first-half, but remains winless at a visiting manager to the red half of Manchester."

      "Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville does not believe that the Red Devils would have signed midfielder Sofyan Amrabat had Kobbie Mainoo not had an issue during the summer",
      "Manchester United were forced into signing Sofyan Amrabat in the summer according to Gary Neville.",
      "The midfielder arrived at Old Trafford on transfer deadline day in September as they looked to strengthen Erik ten Hag's hand. The Morocco international joined on an £8.5million loan, with the Red Devils holding an option to make the deal permanent for £21.4m.",
      "The 27-year-old has made 17 United appearances this term and returned to Ten Hag's squad for the clash with Manchester United after a stint at the Africa Cup of Nations. His time away has seen young midfielder Kobbie Mainoo continue his rise to prominence however.",
      "The 18-year-old scored his first goal for the club against Newport in the FA Cup, quickly followed by an impressive Premier League winner against Wolves to earn United three points. Mainoo's reputation is quickly growing and he has established himself as a regular in Ten Hag's midfield while Amrabat has been absent.",
      "Former Man United defender Neville revealed that Mainoo's talent was appreciated much earlier at the club however. The pundit suggested that an injury to the teenager was the only reason United decided to make the move to land Ambrabat from Fiorentina.",
      "He said: \"To be fair to Ten Hag, I made the inquiry in the transfer window over the summer about whether they needed another central midfielder. Amrabat was linked with them at the time but they’ve said that if Mainoo hadn’t been injured, they’d have not brought anyone in.",
      "\"Because he did go down, Amrabat came in but the faith was there in him from the start. He’s proven already that he’s got the quality as well as the temperament to play in these big matches, he’s a real star.\"",
      "Mainoo has wasted little time in convincing those less familiar of him with his talent too. Rasmus Hojlund arrived in the summer in a £72m deal and was quickly told about the midfielder that was leaving tongues wagging.",
      "Following Mainoo's match-winning goal in midweek, Hojlund said: \"I didn’t get to see him in pre-season because I wasn’t there. But all of the lads were talking about him and saying he is a generational talent. He has a nice body type, he is very mature and has a good personality as well.",
      "\"He’s very calm, and outside the pitch he’s a nice, relaxed guy. You can see he’s composed and shows his quality, and he showed it again tonight - he’s an incredible talent. He’s only 18-years-old, and I thought I was young.\""

      "Manchester United fans brutally trolled Kurt Zouma after the West Ham defender was fouled by Rasmus Hojlund during their clash on Sunday.",
      "French centre-back Zouma was filmed physically abusing a cat in 2022 and has had to deal with various taunts from opposition fans since. Hojlund, who'd scored to make it 1-0 to the home side in the 23rd minute, was defending a corner shortly after and poked Zouma in the eye. United supporters in the Stretford End were heard chanting when Zouma was down: \"That's how your cat feels!\"",
      "The 29-year-old former Chelsea and Stoke defender was sentenced to 180 hours' worth of community service after pleading guilty to kicking and slapping the cat. Zouma regularly takes stick from supporters of other clubs and social media users often enjoy making a dig at him.",
      "One posted during Sunday's match: \"Zouma has gone down like a cat being punched in the face by a professional athlete.\" Another added: \"Wonder if the cat he kicked went down as easy as him after a finger in the face.\"",
      "Zouma expressed his \"great remorse\" over the much-criticised incent during an interview in 2022, telling West Ham's website: \"It's been a difficult spell for me and my family. Obviously I have done something very bad and I apologise again for what I’ve done. I know it was very tough for people to watch and to see that and obviously I feel very, very sorry.",
      "\"I have great remorse about it and now I’m trying to move on with my family and looking ahead. I learned from it, that's the most important thing, I would say. Obviously, I had support from many, many people around me who helped me stay focused on football and I try to stay happy.",
      "\"The club has been unbelievable with me, the support that I received from my teammates, from the staff, and everyone at the club, and even from the fans, has been unreal, and they helped me stay focused on the game, to try to do my best on the pitch all the time and, obviously, I can’t thank them enough for what they've done. This club is like my family.\"",
      "His brother, Yoan - who admitted one count of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his older brother to commit an offence - was ordered to carry out 140 hours' worth of community service. Having fined the player, West Ham made donations to nine animal welfare charities in the UK and overseas."

And the memorable 4-3 victory at Molineux has sparked hopes that Erik ten Hag's side could put a run of form together between now and May.",
      "At the start of the campaign there was a thought that United could insert themselves into the title picture, having finished third and reached two cup finals in Ten Hag's maiden season in charge. But after suffering nine defeats in their opening 22 matches, they are already a distant 11 points off the top four, albeit with a game in hand.",
      "Speaking ahead of the clash with West Ham at Old Trafford, the two Red Devils legends both suggested that a top-four spot was all but out of reach. Finishing fifth could be enough for the Champions League this season, and Keane and Neville agree that should be the overall target for the season.",
      "Keane said: \"A positive end for them this season would be finishing fifth and getting back into the Champions League if that’d be enough for them to do so.",

      "He will not enjoy a free run at the Crystal Palace star though with Manchester City ready to rival them. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has recently taken control of the football operations at Old Trafford and his influence over transfer dealings is expected to begin this summer.",
      "The Red Devils' squad is in need of reinforcements and Olise is one of the hottest prospects in the Premier League. He's continued to thrive at Crystal Palace, signing a new deal in the summer as the Eagles warned off interest from Chelsea, who are expected to return again in the summer.",
      "The expectation though, according to The Sun, is that United and City will be the frontrunners. Pep Guardiola's side are ready to throw more than £60million at the winger, who will only move if he is guaranteed game time at the Etihad.",
      "Olise's new deal included a release clause, although that figure is not yet widely known. He's scored six times this term and provided a further three assists in a Palace side that have struggled throughout the season.",
      "Ten Hag is seeking more reinforcements after a hit and miss history in the market as United boss. The team are in need of improvements on the flanks with a host of their options underperforming. Antony, one of the club's most expensive ever signings, has failed to live up to expectations.",

We're now going into the season with pretty much the team we ended last season with. We'll try to do one or two more things next week but this makes us all feel a bit better. Michael's got his own mind and people have got to make decisions about their own life.",

      "Getafe manager Jose Bordalas has described Manchester United loanee Mason Greenwood as \"a great guy\" who shows \"exemplary behaviour.\"",
      "Greenwood, 22, has been in the headlines this week after England star Jude Bellingham was accused of calling him a 'rapist' after making a crunching tackle on him during Getafe's 2-0 defeat at home to Real Madrid on Thursday. In February 2023, Greenwood had charges of attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "An expert lip-reader believes that Bellingham did indeed make the slur at Greenwood, who's also had chants involving the word 'die' aimed towards him this season by various groups of opposition supporters. La Liga have now launched an investigation after Getafe complained and boss Bordalas has defended the forward, who'll remain with the Spanish club until the end of this season.",
      "\"I know the same thing that you know,\" Bordalos told a press conference. \"It's not up to me, it's the club, La Liga and the (Spanish Football) Federation (RFEF) that have to make an assessment about it. The only thing that I can say is that I ask for respect for Mason Greenwood because he is a great guy. He is a man who respects everyone and has exemplary behaviour.\"",
      "After Bellingham's alleged slur had gone viral on social media, Getafe - who are also based in Madrid - asked referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea to note the allegation in his match report. The 20-year-old, who cost Real £88million to sign from Borussia Dortmund and is expected to be one of England's most important players at the European Championships this summer, could be subject to a disciplinary case led by the RFEF.",

Getafe will also play on Sunday, as Greenwood and his team-mates travel to face Real Betis. The United academy graduate has scored four goals and provided four assists across 18 La Liga appearances this season, prompting speculation over a big-money transfer move.",
      "Barcelona are reportedly interested alongside Valencia and Real Sociedad. Greenwood's move to Getafe was shrouded in controversy, with United deciding that he'd continue his career away from Old Trafford amid protests from supporters regarding his potential return.",

It takes more work than talent. We were confident because of the talent, because of the level he has had.",
      "\"Being able to opt for a player of this level at Getafe is complicated, almost impossible. And well, given the situation, we bet on him. We are happy and content because we have a great player, he is a good boy, he has fitted in really well and he just needs to learn a little more Spanish.\""

But neither of them brings the calmness on the ball and the quality in possession that Martinez provides.

      "Man United have won three games in a row for only the second time this season and they have the nucleus of a promising side.",
      "You will recognise the photograph but maybe not its name. Sir Alex Ferguson would. Lunch Atop A Skyscraper, the image of 11 workers having a breather on a steel beam 800 feet high in Manhattan during the construction of the Rockefeller Plaza in 1932, adorned Ferguson's office wall when he was the Manchester United manager.",
      "Ferguson's affinity with New York dates back decades (he owns an apartment there) and he noticed the image is of 11 workers. An obvious parallel with the day job.",
      "Apprentices at United would be ushered into Ferguson's office and the Scot would draw their attention to the picture. Cristiano Ronaldo evocatively recalls seeing it and being struck by the absence of a single safety harness.",
      "That image came to mind as Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo assembled for United's second goal against West Ham. The only peril they were in was of tumbling a few feet into the terraces but the bond and unity was comparable with the New Yorkers.",
      "\"The picture covered a lot, I think, of the three youngsters celebrating together,\" Erik ten Hag said. \"It's not about one player, it's about a team. That's what I have seen today. It looked like a team. 11 defending, 11 attacking. For me, it was enjoyable to watch.\"",
      "Garnacho mimicked the West Ham winger Mohammed Kudus's celebration and described it as an \"inspiration\". But the similarity with an image captured almost a century ago is more relevant.",
      "Ten Hag was free to pick his strongest United team in both fixtures last week, they won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since November and racked up seven goals - more than they had tallied in their previous six league matches. The word \"team\" surfaced nine times at his post-match debrief.",
      "\"I'm not telling you we are there where we want but you see the potential,\" Ten Hag said. \"But you can only work on the potential when the team is available and when certain positions are not available you have to be creative. We have times in the season where every time we have to adapt to put an XI out and now in this moment, we don't have.\"",
      "Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo are at the forefront of United's mini resurgence. That they are so integral is hardly revelatory. Mainoo was preparing to start the season in the starting XI during pre-season until the Real Madrid winger Rodrygo collided with his ankle in Houston in late July.",
      "Mainoo's first-team return came four months later and that was overdue. He had been fit for more than a month but was eased back in, featuring in a Uefa Youth League and EFL Trophy match. His selection at Salford City on Halloween was a disappointment as he should have been with the first team, preparing to face Newcastle in the League Cup 24 hours later.",
      "That tie was a missed opportunity. United were reeling from a 3-0 derby defeat and there was a chance to turn the page in the competition they won last season. Some of Ten Hag's selections were uninspiring (Anthony Martial and Antony) and there was a second successive 3-0 home humbling.",
      "Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo were not selected in the same XI until Liverpool away on December 17, when United gained a creditable point. The trio have started in all but one of the past nine games except the defeat at Nottingham Forest as Hojlund was unwell.",
      "Hojlund turned 21 on Sunday but his coming of age moment was the instinctive winning volley against Aston Villa on Boxing Day. He has scored in every league start since and broke double figures against West Ham. Garnacho has claimed two two-goal hauls and Mainoo's name is now in the goalscoring charts.",
      "\"Us young guys, we have a little group and we're chatting to each other and it's very cool to have other young players around the team,\" Hojlund told the Manchester Evening News last week. \"And hopefully we can set an era for the club and be here many years together.\"",
      "\"We now have a team that is in balance on the pitch,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"We can play better, also you see the progress is coming. We bought players in the summer for the future, we also made choices to give players who deserve it, to give opportunities in the first team as Garnacho and Mainoo.",
      "\"Mainoo in the second game against Madrid gets a real bad injury, then the plans you have, you have to adapt. Hojlund had a period, he came late in, young, but you see he is progressing, when there is a consistent team in his back with routines they will serve him better and you see a frontline in balance.",
      "\"It is a threat for every opponent and also you see they enjoy it, to play football, they enjoy it, to give opponents problems, they want to do the togetherness.\"",
      "There was some levity at Ten Hag's press conference following his sorrowful update on Lisandro Martinez. He laughed that journalists \"didn't believe\" that United would come good with their regulars back. \"Oh, I did!\" replied a witty time-served reporter.",
      "Martinez's potentially lengthy lay-off is a colossal setback but there was encouragement to be extracted from Harry Maguire's proactive performance, even if it was blemished by two glaring errors.",
      "United committed more than £50million to sign two goalkeepers in the summer and Andre Onana had a much-needed stable afternoon, reacting impressively to repel the ricochet off Edson Alvarez. Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw, tied down on new contracts last year, are nearing their peaks of Ten Hag's first season.",
      "Casemiro's performance level has been reminiscent of his influential first season rather than his start to this season since he returned. Marcus Rashford has looked more engaged over the last week than in the first five months of the campaign. Ten Hag referred to a core squad of \"15 or 16 players\" and Scott McTominay contributed off the bench for the second time in a week to assist Garnacho's clincher.",
      "It is a promising blend of youth and experience. \"They (the youngsters) need experienced players, experienced players who've achieved everything to help them, to put them in the right positions, right moment and right attitude,\" Ten Hag noted.",
      "Ten Hag claimed United \"bought players in the summer for the future\". That is true of Hojlund but Onana, Mason Mount, Altay Bayindir, Sofyan Amrabat and Jonny Evans had an average age of 27 when they arrived.",
      "A couple of uplifting wins should not alter plans for next season. United still need a new right-back, a centre-back, at least one midfielder and two forwards. Of that quintet of targets, three have to be recruited to enhance the starting XI.",
      "Then United may have an image of 11 workmates worthy of adorning walls.",

      "Lisandro Martinez could be set for another spell on the sidelines and Man Utd have already struggled without him this season.",
      "It was probably no coincidence that Manchester United’s best week of the season came when Lisandro Martinez returned to the side. The Argentine gives them so much not just defensively but going forward as well.",
      "United scored 11 goals in three straight wins and although a goal at each of Newport County, Wolves and West Ham came when Martinez was off the pitch, he gives Erik ten Hag’s side something that no other defender can.",
      "There have been times this season - this week, even - when United have defended well as a unit, but individually Harry Maguire is having a good season and Raphael Varane has been good since his return to favour.",
      "But neither of them brings the calmness on the ball and the quality in possession that Martinez provides. His ability to take the ball under pressure and progress it forward is unparalleled for a centre-back at Old Trafford and what’s more, he does it with his left foot, bringing balance to the backline.",
      "Martinez is arguably the best line-breaking passer from defence in the Premier League and his ability to take players out of the game, firing accurate passes into the feet of his midfielders and forwards, has launched many a United attack.",
      "He also helps with the quality of the build-up play and it’s been noticeable that Andre Onana has been more confident playing short passes out with Martinez in the team with him against Wolves and West Ham.",
      "Defensively he adds something as well, as the most aggressive and front-footed defender in the squad. United have had a soft underbelly this season and they still aren’t doing enough to stop teams from creating chances - West Ham had 22 shots on Sunday - but the Argentine is an excellent one-on-one defender and that counts for something when Ten Hag has tried to turn United into a more attacking, more positionally aggressive side this season.",
      "Of all the players whose absences have affected the form and stability of the team this season, Martinez’s has probably been the most telling, so having only had him back for three games, you can understand why Ten Hag labelled a fresh injury setback for the 26-year-old as a “disaster”.",
      "Martinez immediately looked in discomfort when he went down after a tussle with Vladimir Coufal. He is a tough footballer so when he punches the grass while waiting for treatment it is a sign he is struggling.",
      "That should have been the moment caution prevailed and he was withdrawn, but for some reason he was allowed to return to the field of play and then went down for a second time. It’s certainly possible he could have aggravated the injury in that time.",
      "United are now praying the injury isn’t as bad as feared, but Ten Hag cut a pessimistic figure despite his team securing their most comfortable league win of the season at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We do everything to get the right diagnosis to see what the damage is,” said Ten Hag. “He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it's a personal disaster when it's really bad. But let's wait for what it is.",
      "\"But for the team, also it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",
      "There can be no arguments with that statement. Martinez has already missed 34 games since last April with a metatarsal injury that he picked up against Sevilla and then aggravated earlier this season.",
      "If he faces another spell on the sidelines it is likely Varane and Maguire will combine again, although Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are in reserve.",
      "None of them offer the quality on the ball or the balance that Martinez does, however. When he doesn’t play United’s build-up suffers and they find it harder to progress the ball and harder to create chances.",
      "Maybe signing a player with similar attributes to Martinez will be a priority this summer, but that will be easier to do if United secure the revenue that comes with Champions League football. That is already an uphill task for them, but it will begin to look like scaling a mountain if Martinez is out for any length of time.",

      "West Ham defender Emerson had successfully marked Garnacho out of the game until he fashioned an opening and fired his shot beyond Lukasz Fabianski in the 49th minute. There was a touch of fortune for that goal due to the deflection but the youngster didn't care.",

      "The winger did not start in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City at Old Trafford in October but he's started every game since then, recently making a switch to the right side of the attack.",

      "The 19-year-old was recently asked on a gaming stream which position he preferred - the left or right wing - and he intelligently responded: \"Being on the pitch.\"",
      "There was always a suspicion Garnacho would be just as effective on the right and he's matured in front of fans' eyes this season, adapting to what his manager wants and contributing goals.",
      "Garnacho did not have his best game against West Ham and still scored twice. The ability to score when having a quiet afternoon is invaluable and he now has seven in all competitions.",
      "In comparison, he scored just six goals last season and he could double that haul by the end of 2023/24, which has seen Garnacho finally establish himself as a reliable senior player.",
      "The biggest area of improvement for Garnacho was to start having the same impact when he started games as when he came off the bench and he's certainly achieved that.",
      "Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo perched themselves on the advertising hoarding after United's second goal and the outcome of that celebration was a brilliant photo.",
      "Garnacho is sat in the centre of the trio, with a wide grin on his face. \"We bought players in the summer for the future, we also made choices to give players who deserve it, to give opportunities in the first team as Garnacho and Mainoo,\" Ten Hag said at his press conference.",

      "As the Reds attempt to save their season, Erik ten Hag must battle with the idea of who replaces Martinez. For supporters, this is an easy decision to make.",
      "Raphael Varane has proven, when fit, how good a defender he is and on paper he seems the perfect option to line up next to Harry Maguire who excelled againt West Ham. However, the Dutchman has already explained why he is likely to overlook the Frenchman when it comes to replacing Martinez.",
      "Back in November, he explained: \"There are moments in certain games where they [Maguire and Varane] can play together and they have already proven they can do it. But the buildup is not that fluid when one of them is playing from the left centre-back position because I think Licha [Lisandro Martínez], obviously, Luke Shaw, obviously, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, they are right-footed, but they can play really comfortably with their left and make the right angles, then you can construct a better formation where you can start to play.\"",
      "Due to this belief by ten Hag, he is unlikely to pair Maguire and Varane together from the off. So the question is, who misses out?",
      "Based on his performance against the Iron, Maguire is likely to get the nod at Villa Park meaning Varane will remain on the bench. Such a decision will prove unpopular but moving Shaw centrally or recalling Lindelof to the starting XI seems more plausible at this stage.",
      "Maguire's renaissance under Ten Hag is nothing more than exceptional and he deserves his place in the team. It also serves to underline why Varane's future is now in doubt.",

      "Lisandro Martinez could miss as many as nine matches for Manchester United after he was forced off with a knee injury against West Ham United on Sunday.",
      "The Argentine was starting only his fourth match since returning from a previous lengthy lay-off but was forced out of the 3-0 win at Old Trafford after clashing with Hammers defender Vladimir Coufal in the 71st minute. Martinez could be seen clutching his knee in agony after the incident, raising fears that he could be set to endure another spell out of the team.",
      "And that seems to have been confirmed by Argentine journalist Gaston Edul who has shared an update on the situation via social media. As translated, the TyC Sports reporter wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"Lisandro Martinez has a sprained collateral ligament. The worst scenario was ruled out. It is between a month and a half and two months of recovery. You don't have to have surgery. Good news.\"",
      "The suggestion that Martinez will not require surgery should mean his season has not ended in February, but the 26-year-old is set to miss a number of key matches. Should he need the full two months to recover he will miss eight Premier League games and at least one FA Cup fixture.",
      "Martinez will miss out on the crunch trip to Aston Villa on February 11, where United will attempt to make up some points on the team that currently occupies the fourth Champions League qualification spot. He will also have to sit out a trip to Luton Town on February 18.",
      "A game against Fulham on February 24 is the first home game he will miss. United will face either Bristol City or Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup fifth round on February 28, but they will have to make the midweek trip without their Argentine defender. Of course if United make it through to the quarter-final of the FA Cup, he could miss that too.",
      "Martinez is likely to be more frustrated by the fact that he will be unavailable to face champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Match 3, before United play host to Everton on March 9.",
      "Another home game against Sheffield United follows on Match 16 before a tricky away trip at Brentford could be encountered without Martinez on March 30. Should he require the full two months out, the final match he will miss is a key trip to Chelsea under the lights on April 3.",
      "Assuming Martinez will be fit again after this date, his first match back could hardly be more significant. United will host arch rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford on April 6, where the opportunity to dent Jurgen Klopp's Premier League title ambitions should serve as motivation alone to get back to full fitness.",

Emerson Palmieri seized on Maguire's hesitancy and looked to pass when he had to shoot. He only threatened those in the Scoreboard End. A minute later, Garnacho wriggled out of Palmieri's pocket and scored.",

Hojlund has now broken double figures for United goals and his 10th was his most singular. The Dane has scored some great goals and his potential to be a great goalscorer is more apparent with every game.",
      "Hojlund had the confidence to deceive the West Ham defenders and switch the ball to his weaker right foot. He wellied the ball in as though it was his strongest. Whilst players joined the throng, Ten Hag had stuffed his hands back into his pockets. He is nearing vindication with the £72million striker.",
      "Steve Holland, Gareth Southgate's assistant, was in the directors' box and nattering with the United football director John Murtough before kick-off. Five England internationals started across both sides but the one Holland had to have cast his eye over carefully was Mainoo. The 18-year-old drew applause in the 21st minute for a smart shimmy that deceived Kudus before setting Garnacho on his way.",
      "Another England midfielder, Kalvin Phillips, was promptly dropped by Moyes after a chastening debut against Bournemouth in midweek. Phillips's substitute status did not spare the former Leeds and Manchester City midfielder from the Stretford End giving him grief during an early warm-up. Phillips was a good enough sport to engage in the repartee. Then he was robbed of the ball for Garnacho's second goal.",
      "Phillips was still seated when Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo sat down.",

      "Investment from INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been formalised - subject to Premier League ratification - and changes have been made behind the scenes",
      "Gary Neville reckons Erik ten Hag might need to usurp Aston Villa or Tottenham in order to keep his job. Change is on the horizon for Manchester United behind the scenes with investment from Sir Jim Ratcliffe rubber-stamped on Christmas Eve - although that deal remains subject to Premier League ratification.",
      "There has been precious little to celebrate at Old Trafford and beyond on the pitch this season. However, now the injury woes have started to subside, United have won their last two matches to move up to sixth-place with goals from Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho (2) doing the damage against West Ham.",
      "Five teams from England - rather than the usual four - could be awarded Champions League spots next campaign and that opens the door up for improved United moving forward. However, with Villa and Tottenham four and six points above them respectively, there is work to do.",
      "Speaking about Ten Hag and his position, Neville told Sky Sports: \"That's the biggest decision the new ownership will have to make in the next few months. They'll bring in a sporting director, because there's not one already, but whether they keep the manager is the one everyone will be looking out for come the end of the season.\"",
      "Neville added: \"Roy [Keane] said it that fifth is the best I think they could possibly do. One of those teams, Aston Villa or Tottenham, would have to slip up because I don't think they're anywhere near Arsenal, City and Liverpool.",
      "\"Those teams are gone. For United and Ten Hag - if he wants to continue here - he'll have to impress those above him before the end of the season. INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, they'll go into that club and be disruptive, they have to be, so I think that they're all under pressure.",

      "Man United need to clear the decks in the 2024 summer transfer window and begin the process of trying to avoid mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe corrects just one department at Manchester United this forthcoming summer, it has to be the recruitment department.",
      "For far too long, United have been guilty of over-spending on players, courtesy of poor strategic planning and rash decision-making. As part of their minority investment at Old Trafford, INEOS have secured management of the club's football operations, meaning they will oversee all aspects of recruitment.",
      "INEOS, of course, have acted swiftly to try and lay the foundations for a brighter future on that particular front, swooping for Omar Berrada, who has been installed as the club's new CEO, from Manchester City. He has already warned about the dangers of paying over the odds for players - something United have been guilty of time after time.",
      "The £85.5million acquisition of Antony from Ajax in September 2022 is a prime example. The art of perfecting recruitment is a two-way system and United have not mastered it in recent years. They have been guilty of stock-piling players, often allowing them to run down their contracts and leave for free, or selling them for minimal fees when the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City have commanded respectable fees for their unwanted stars.",
      "Though they have played their part for United this season, the club's failure to offload both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay last summer are prime examples of their failure to trim the squad and command hefty transfer fees. United cannot afford to repeat such errors ahead of 2024/25, and it is unlikely that INEOS will allow them to.",
      "This forthcoming summer's transfer window promises to be one of the most intriguing United have faced in years. The eyes of the world will be on Old Trafford to see what impact INEOS have.",
      "If they are serious about taking United back to the top, they need to significantly improve the club's ability to trade in the transfer market. Looking ahead to the summer, the Reds have a whole host of players on their books who need moving on permanently.",
      "Focusing primarily on those who will be under contract at the beginning of next season, you can argue that a minimum of 11 players need selling, both for the benefit of the club and each individual's career. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Victor Lindelof have both had their contracts extended until June 2025, meaning United have avoided the risk of losing them for free this summer.",
      "United plan to recruit a first-choice right-back ahead of next season, meaning either Diogo Dalot or Wan-Bissaka will need moving on. Dalot has a higher ceiling, meaning it would make sense to cash in on Wan-Bissaka this summer, with the next transfer window representing United's last chance to try and secure a respectable fee for him.",
      "The same can be said for Lindelof. United want to sign a new centre-back this summer, meaning the Swede's game time could be reduced even further, resulting in his valuation dropping.",
      "Other United defenders are not safe from being sold, either. Will Fish, under contract until 2025, with the option to extend for a further year, is currently on a second loan spell at Hibernian in as many seasons, meaning, with all due respect, he is never likely to make the grade at Old Trafford and become a regular under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Brandon Williams and Alvaro Fernandez both have clauses within their contracts for additional one-year options to be triggered, meaning they could then pave the way for potential offers to come United's way, so long as suitors have already declared interest. The deal which saw Benfica sign Fernandez includes an obligation to buy if he starts 50 per cent of matches and they will pay €6m plus €3m in potential add-ons. There will still be an option to buy if the obligation isn't triggered.",
      "Hannibal Mejbri and Donny van de Beek both departed on loan last month, joining Sevilla and Eintracht Frankfurt respectively. Each deal could be made permanent.",
      "Though Hannibal offered flashes of his class earlier this term, he is unlikely to have a long-term future at Old Trafford. Van de Beek needs moving off the books as soon as possible.",
      "In forward areas, Facundo Pellistri and Jadon Sancho departed on loan in the January window, potentially ending their hopes of long-term futures in M16. Sancho had been frozen out by Ten Hag since September after a public fallout.",
      "If both players impress during their respective loans at Granada and Borussia Dortmund, this summer would represent an opportunity for United to cash in. The sales of both players would almost certainly see them record losses, though.",
      "Mason Greenwood is still under contract at Old Trafford, meaning United need to actively try and get him off the books permanently this summer. Several clubs in Spain, including current loan club Getafe, have been linked with signing him.",
      "Omari Forson may also be sold for a fee if United tie him down to a new contract. He is out-of-contract this summer, but the Reds, in the past, have tied a player down to a new deal and then sold them at the next available juncture.",

      "Here are the moments you might have missed from Man United's 3-0 win over West Ham United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Two goals from Alejandro Garnacho, both of which came in the second half, and one from Rasmus Hojlund prior to the break gave the Reds their biggest home league win of the season. United have now won each of their last two league outings, scoring seven goals in the process.",
      "Though the victory suggested United had everything their own way, West Ham had the better of the chances in the first half. They also spurned a golden opportunity to draw level moments before Garnacho made it 2-0 at the start of the second period.",
      "Nevertheless, United were full value for their victory over the course of the 90 minutes, inspired by eye-catching displays from Hojlund and Garnacho. The duo, particularly the latter, caused no shortage of problems for David Moyes' side, who had arrived at Old Trafford one point ahead of the Reds in the standings. Below, MEN Sport has highlighted some of the moments you may not have spotted from Sunday's encounter at Old Trafford.",
      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, former United striker Robin van Persie was spotted back in familiar surroundings. The former Netherlands international spent three years in M16, scoring 58 goals in 105 appearances in all competitions between 2012 and 2015.",
      "Such was the level of success he enjoyed during his time at the club, it was hardly surprising to see so many United fans sat in front of the directors' box asking him for a picture and his autograph. Van Persie kindly agreed to those requests and spent a few moments engaging with supporters. He was also in attendance at Old Trafford for the 3-2 win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day.",
      "Though United took a slender 1-0 lead into the half-time interval, their defenders had had to deal with more than what West Ham's had in the first half. Either side of Hojlund's opener, United's back-four and keeper Andre Onana were called into action.",
      "With 35 minutes on the clock, West Ham attempted to work the ball into the left channel of the penalty area with Emerson Palmieri latching onto a clever pass from Mohammed Kudus. But before Emerson even had chance to lift his head in the hope of picking out a man in a white shirt, Lisandro Martinez was across to greet him.",
      "The Argentine arrived on the scene in the blink of an eye, making an excellent challenge to put the ball into touch. As soon as he was back on his feet, Diogo Dalot was slapping his flesh in a show of appreciation and celebration.",
      "Dalot produced a tackle at Molineux on Thursday night that resulted in Raphael Varane, Onana and Martinez coming over and celebrating it like a goal. This may have been Martinez's way of returning the favour.",
      "As Harry Maguire gave the ball away in a dangerous area, few inside Old Trafford would have anticipated celebrating a second United goal a few moments later. But after the Reds had got themselves up the pitch quickly, the majority of those inside M16 were on their feet.",
      "Garnacho provided the all-important knockout blow, seeing a deflected effort fly past replacement West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. He wheeled over to the far side to celebrate the adjoining corners between the Stretford End and the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand.",
      "Once in position, he perched himself on the edge of the advertising hoardings and was soon joined by Kobbie Mainoo and Hojlund, with the duo sitting either side of him. Each donning huge smiles, they put their arms around each other for a few seconds, no doubt savouring the smiles and happy faces all around them. We could be seeing the same celebration on show time and time again in the coming years.",
      "After converting his second goal of the afternoon, Garnacho ran in the direction of where he had celebrated his first. Just like on the previous occasion, the youngster perched himself on the advertising hoardings.",
      "With Mainoo off the field of play by this juncture, there was no chance of his first celebration being replicated in full. However, after being mobbed by his teammates, Hojlund embraced his fellow forward and gave him a small kiss on the cheek. It was another moment that highlighted the togetherness and spirit within the squad.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",

Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",

      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",

This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Martinez had only just recovered from a long-standing foot issue, too, before working up his fitness upon a return to the team. Here, we take a closer look at three ways United can line up without the Argentine for however many games he eventually misses.",
      "United made one alteration to their starting XI for the win over West Ham with Harry Maguire replacing Raphael Varane as the World Cup winner was afforded some rest after back-to-back games. It was the former Real Madrid defender who replaced Martinez when he went down clutching his knee at Old Trafford.",
      "Maguire and Varane would be the sensible and most-likely combination for the Villa match. Last season, Ten Hag opted for continuity where possible and now things are finally starting to ease on the injury front - Martinez aside - the Dutchman will probably not shake things up too much unless he needs to.",
      "There is another route for Ten Hag to explore, though, as he did on occasion last campaign. Luke Shaw excelled at centre-back when Martinez was absent, previously, but an ongoing injury to Tyrell Malacia - not to mention Sergio Reguilon returning to Tottenham last month after his loan spell - leaves United short on left-backs.",
      "Malacia is due to back from a long-term knee problem any time now. As and when he becomes available, it would enable Ten Hag to move Shaw into the middle if he wants to utilise his trusty left foot and passing range.",
      "United had to be creative in the early months this term when they had so many injury absentees. That included an unsuccessful audition for Fiorentina loanee Sofyan Amrabat at left-back. Fortunately, there are more suitable picks right across the board, even though United will miss Martinez for however many games.",
      "Varane continues to be nursed through amid his well-documented injury record. A return for Aaron Wan-Bissaka is on the horizon, while Victor Lindelof could also step in alongside Maguire for another contingency.",

The player's first year at Old Trafford coincided with a seventh-place finish in the Premier League - United's lowest since 1990.",

The midfielder stayed and fought, eventually finding his feet with Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho in charge, with the latter in particular getting the best out of him.",
      "The Belgian became an impact player, capable of scoring key goals, and he left to join Chinese side Shandong Taishan in 2019 with the best wishes of fans. From scoring in the Manchester derby, to helping United reach the FA Cup final and producing late, match-winning headers in the league, Fellaini knew where the net was.",

      "Man United won 3-0 against West Ham in the Premier League with Alejandro Garnacho scoring twice and Rasmus Hojlund also on target",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has warned he is 'hungry' to score more goals after netting for the fourth Premier League game in a row against West Ham on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Many felt the 4-3 victory against Wolves in midweek could be the turning point in the season and United built on that performance by securing a comfortable 3-0 win against the Hammers. Hojlund opened the scoring in the first half with an excellent finish and Alejandro Garnacho scored a brace after half-time to make sure of the result.",
      "Hojlund spoke to MUTV after the game and made a goalscoring pledge. He said: \"Reaching double figures already for such a big club is a big achievement, but I think I've said it the whole season, I'm not done. I'm hungry for more and want to keep developing, keep scoring goals, keep moving up the table and keep getting wins.",
      "\"Keep linking up with my teammates because I'm enjoying it at the moment. I think confidence is not the right word [when not scoring], you start to get a little annoyed and angry, so you lose the calmness in some situations.",
      "\"I always believed in myself, so I kept trying, and looked at my own game and what I could improve. Speaking with my teammates and the manager, asking what they see.",
      "\"We've had some talks and I've improved since I came here, so it's looking good right now. When the confidence is going, I believe I have good shots with both feet.",
      "Hojlund was asked about playing with his attacking teammates, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes and Garnacho, and said: \"A lot of excitement. Every day I come in for training and to do my job.",
      "\"I'm happy because I know I need to play with those guys, I enjoy it and you can also start seeing the connection getting good now. We're giving each other confidence and goals, involvements in the game, so I'm very happy.\"",

      "Lisandro Martinez's injury has highlighted a transfer issue Manchester United will need to address in the summer transfer window",
      "Manchester United may have believed their immediate problems at centre back were over with the return of Lisandro Martinez from injury in mid-January.",
      "However, having suffered another setback in United’s 3-0 win against West Ham the Argentine’s injury reopened numerous questions about the future of the position at the club. Erik ten Hag still has four senior options at centre back, but with all four over the age of 30 at the start of next season, there is a need to sign a long-term option that can partner Martinez when he returns.",
      "So, who should be the Reds' top target? Throughout Europe, there are a number of top options, including Bayer Leverkusen’s Jonathan Tah, Inter Milan’s Alessandro Bastoni and Barcelona’s Ronald Araújo.",
      "Any of those would represent a good signing but perhaps the perfect long-term option is Sporting Lisbon's Gonçalo Inácio. The Portugal defender was heavily linked with an exit in the January transfer window, with Newcastle and Liverpool touted as possible destinations, but there was no firm offer and Inácio signed a contract extension.",
      "The deal was a clever move by the Portuguese club to raise the 22-year-old's buyout clause to £52million, still a relatively low figure for a player of his ability. Inácio has been key to the resurgence of Lisbon under Rúben Amorim, with a league title in 2021, when Inácio was an integral member of the starting XI.",
      "The centre back would slot seamlessly into Ten Hag’s side as the Dutchman looks to continue developing his possession-based, front-foot style of play at Manchester United. Inácio’s ability to calmly play out from the back with the ball, maintain possession, and start attacks from defence demonstrates his suitability to be an important part of the United backline.",
      "Inácio has an outstanding ability to read the play, helping to manoeuvre him into positions to cut out dangerous attacks, while his pace and ability to perfectly time challenges help to limit the threat of attacks against his side.",
      "Pair these abilities with the calm, reassuring nature of Inácio’s personality and this makes him a potential stalwart of any defence for years to come. While the Reds will have to wait until the summer, he is well worth the wait if United have the patience and willingness to pay his release clause.",

      "The horse will now join British champion trainer Paul Nicholls and list legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson as one of his owners. Andy and Gemma Brown, who manage their horses under Caldwell Construction, shook the racing world when they announced they would sell all their horses.",
      "Caldwell Potter was eagerly anticipated among the 29 lots set to be auctioned off at Fairyhouse. This was no doubt due to its top-rated form over obstacles for Gordon Elliott and outstanding pedigree.",
      "The bidding began at €100,000 but dramatically escalated in a last-ditch duel between two prospective buyers. Silence filled the sales ring when a €700,000 bid was accepted.",
      "Despite Gordon Elliot's counteroffer of €720,000, the final hammer was struck at €740,000 setting a new record for the dearest National Hunt horse ever publicly purchased. It was revealed that successful bidder was Highflyer bloodstock agent Anthony Bromley.",
      "He begrudgingly informed Tattersalls: \"I don't feel great about taking the horse out of Gordon Elliott's yard, he's done so well with the horse, but this is business and you've got to do your best for your clients.",
      "\"When I saw this horse was coming up for sale there was only one call I made and it was to John Hales. He's been a client of mine for many years, since back in the time of Azertyuiop, and we've had Neptune Collonges and Politologue in between. I bought him for a little partnership they've got together, four guys John Hales, Ged Mason, Sir Alex Ferguson and Peter Done.\"",
      "\"I'm thrilled to get the horse, but it is a little bittersweet because I could see how much Gordon was trying to get the horse back when he was bidding.\"",
      "Caldwell Potter, a six year old son of Martaline, has shown promise, winning three times from seven starts in all and two of his first three outings over hurdles, including a Grade One success at Leopardstown's Christmas meeting. He holds entries in the Supreme Novices' Hurdle and the Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle at next month's Cheltenham Festival, but Bromley warned he is not certain to line up in the Cotswolds.",
      "He added: \"He'll go to Paul's and he doesn't have to go to Cheltenham, I believe. It's not the be-all and end-all because it's only going to be four weeks and he has to settle into his new regime. It could be that he needs that bit of time to settle in and go to Aintree, but really we've bought him as a steeplechaser because he's got a pedigree for a Gold Cup in him, I think.\"",
      "\"At the moment he's only run at two miles and he's such an exciting horse for the longer term. Realistically that's why we bought him, not for four weeks' time.\" Caldwell Potter's fee topples the previous record set when Darren Yates bought Interconnected at an auction in Doncaster in 2019 for £620,000.",

      "\"Alejandro Garnacho, 19, scored twice and the 21-year-old birthday boy Rasmus Hojlund also got on the scoresheet as United brushed aside a wasteful West Ham United to climb above them into sixth place. Garnacho, Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo, himself only 18, were sitting arm in arm on one of the advertising hoardings after the Argentinian’s first goal — United’s three young hopes, smiling and delivering as they try to rescue their team’s season.",
      "\"United were ruthless in attack in their third successive win in all competitions, but Lisandro Martínez, Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot played their part too with some lion-hearted defending. Sadly for Martínez, he came off in the second half with a serious-looking knee injury after tangling with Vladimir Coufal. It was a bitter blow for the inspirational centre back, who was playing his fourth game back after a long-term foot injury.\"",
      "'It was that type of afternoon for Erik ten Hag’s work in progress'",

      "\"It was that type of afternoon for Erik ten Hag’s work in progress. On his 21st birthday, Højlund greeted his finish with a hopping air-guitar mime and a raucous cheer was provoked when, after Garnacho doubled the lead, Diogo Dalot skidded along the grass to block Jarrod Bowen’s shot.",

      "Man Utd secured their easiest home win of the season in the Premier League as they beat West Ham 3-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "A clinical touch",
      "On the balance of play it's fair to say Manchester United didn't deserve to win this game 3-0. But for the first time this season, they are starting to show the clinical edge that can sometimes mark out the very best sides.",
      "West Ham had almost twice as many shots as United and some very good chances, but they weren't efficient in front of goal and Erik ten Hag's side were. It's a ruthless side of the game we haven't seen enough this season but which is beginning to come to the fore at a valuable point of the campaign.",
      "United have scored 15 goals in their last five games and although two of those were against teams from League One and League Two, they also scored twice against Tottenham, four times at Wolves and now three against West Ham.",
      "The finishes produced by Rasmus Hojlund for the first and Alejandro Garnacho for the third showed how important players who can put chances away are. Maybe it's a learning curve for young players, but this side were guilty of missing too many chances earlier in the season. Now they are capitalising more often than not.",
      "Hojlund is leading that change. His goal to open the scoring on Sunday came out of nothing. He worked the space for himself and finished brilliantly. It set an example that Garnacho followed and although this wasn't a brilliant United performance the scoreline was convincing, which has rarely been the case this season.",
      "On countless occasions this season Ten Hag has complained about the lack of a clinical edge in his team. He even did so after the draw against Tottenham last month. He told his team they \"weren't clinical enough\" after the 3-3 draw with Galatasaray in Istanbul that all but ended their Champions League campaign. Finally, it looks like the message is getting through.",
      "Martinez concerns",
      "There were shades of Virgil van Dijk's defending against Moussa Sissoko with the way Lisandro Martinez saw off a dangerous West Ham counter early in the second half. In 2019 Van Dijk was lauded for allowing Sissoko to shoot and instead blocking off the pass to Son Heung-min, who was clearly the more dangerous player.",
      "Martinez did exactly the same here and although he didn't touch the ball, he knew how decisive his decision-making had been when he turned to the crowd to celebrate. It was Emerson Palmieri with the chance, seizing on a loose touch from Harry Maguire to race clear in a two-on-one.",
      "But Martinez blocked the square pass to Jarrod Bowen and forced Emerson to go on his own. His finish was befitting of a full-back who had clearly been desperate to pass.",
      "Martinez's absence has perhaps been the most important of all for United this season, so the sight of him hobbling off in the second half left a cloud over the victory. Ten Hag's post-match diagnosis didn't sound at all encouraging.",
      "Casemiro's contribution",
      "Hojlund will rightly take the plaudits for the brilliance of the goal that gave United the lead, but it wouldn't have been possible without the aggressive, instinctive play that Casemiro displayed throughout last season.",
      "The Brazilian has been a disappointment this season but since returning from an ankle injury he's shown signs of rediscovering his best form. He played a key role in the opener. He looked second favourite to reach the loose ball from Kurt Zouma's clearing header but read the game well and showed good strength to get in front of James Ward-Prowse and beat Tomas Soucek to the ball.",
      "Casemiro made up 10 yards in very little time to slide in and touch the ball to Hojlund. And although what followed was all down to the Dane, the contribution of United's holding midfielder shouldn't be overlooked given it felt like the kind of thing he wasn't doing enough of in the first few months of the season.",
      "Mainoo v Phillips",
      "Kalvin Phillips made the move from Manchester City to West Ham to play the regular football he needs to cement his place in England's Euro 2024 squad, so with Gareth Southgate's assistant Steve Holland watching on at Old Trafford, the midfielder would have been disappointed to have been dropped after one game by his new club.",
      "Phillips gave away the penalty from which Bournemouth scored in midweek and was immediately benched by David Moyes. As a former Leeds and current City player, he had to warm-up in front of the Stretford End, which went as you would expect it to.",
      "It's been a tricky 18 months or so for Phillips since leaving his boyhood club and he was never fancied by Pep Guardiola at the Etihad. He has been a favourite of Southgate's, but his place in the England squad must be under pressure. Several youngsters are making a push for the squad and 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo has to be at the forefront. He is now just 16 games into his senior club career but must be on Southgate's radar, especially with Ghana trying to convince the Stockport-born midfielder to represent the country of his parents.",
      "Maguire's return",
      "Raphael Varane's fitness record speaks for itself at United and in a way the World Cup winner had a good run starting six successive games without picking up another issue, before being benched against West Ham.",
      "That was his longest run of starts in a row in two years and shows how badly injuries have affected his time at the club and his ability to string a run of games together. He remains a superb centre-back, but he struggles to play twice a week, has already retired from international duty and has gone public with his complaints about the schedule.",
      "He is going to need to be rested every now and again and with Maguire back fit it made sense to rotate here, especially given Varane had played at Wolves on Thursday night. Maguire's form this season has warranted more starts.",
      "He defended well against the Hammers in the first half. He read the game superbly early on to get to the ball ahead of Bowen and then made a superb tackle later to block Mohammed Kudus, when he was about to play Ben Johnson into acres of space down the right.",
      "There were a couple of shaky moments after the break, gifting a big chance to Emerson Palmieri at 1-0 and then allowing a ball to go over his head to let Bowen in at 2-0. He got away with both, however, and that is maybe the difference for Maguire at the moment.",

      "Man Utd could make one change to their side when they host West Ham in the Premier League today.",
      "Erik ten Hag named his strongest Manchester United side against Wolves. They still nearly managed to throw it all away.",
      "There were certainly positives to take from the dominant performance, and on another day, it might well have been a victory by a far bigger margin, but the harsh truth is that it wasn't. It was the same story against Newport a week ago. United could have won by a three- or four-goal margin but instead, they threw away another lead when they should have been comfortable.",
      "Yet it would still be a surprise if they chose to make any changes today. Ten Hag has regularly cited his ambition of having a settled squad, and now he has the opportunity to do just that.",
      "It doesn't mean they shouldn't, though. See, while it might be the strongest United side on paper, there is still an argument to suggest it could be better.",
      "United's midfield was ripped apart at ease twice in the last week, but Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo won't be dropped, and the defence has conceded five goals in three matches when the centre-back pairing is supposed to be world-class.",
      "Of course, keeping a clean sheet is not solely down to the centre-backs, but they are certainly a major factor. Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane are still widely believed to be the best two at the club, and yet the goals are still being gifted to opponents.",
      "Martinez was off the pitch by the time Pedro Neto netted a third goal at Molineux, with Varane the unfortunate victim of United's overcommitment in the attack that left the backline exposed. There was little they could have done about the other two Wolves goals, either.",
      "But the partnership of Martinez and Varane is still difficult to endorse due to their respective injury concerns. They have both missed a large part of the season through injuries, and the Argentine was replaced again in midweek as a precaution.",
      "There is hope that Martinez can put his recent injury woes behind them, but the reoccurring nature of Varane's cast doubt over his long-term suitability. For all of their huge achievements—after all, they are both World Cup winners—the best ability is availability, and that is something that neither of them have nailed down this season.",
      "Ten Hag's pursuit of consistency and momentum is being undermined by the regular changes at centre-back, and with a busy fixture schedule ahead, he needs that familiarity to stem from a settled defensive pairing.",
      "Martinez is an integral part of the plans due to his passing ability and the different angles he opens up as a left-footer, but the plan for the summer is to sign a suitable partner for him who complements his style of play.",
      "Varane just can't be relied upon in the long run, and Harry Maguire, who has arguably been the best-performing defender at the club this season, still doesn't seem to be the right fit for Ten Hag's desired style of play.",
      "It is telling that now nearly everyone is available; it is Varane who has been selected over Maguire, but the real test will be keeping the Frenchman fit, which is far easier said than done.",
      "United's defensive pairing is world-class, but only when they are actually fit.",

      "The early team news and main talking points as Man Utd host West Ham in the Premier League at Old Trafford today.",
      "Manchester United will be looking to build upon their dramatic Premier League victory over Wolves when they welcome West Ham to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Erik ten Hag's side showed real character to go again after letting a two-goal lead slip in midweek, but they know they risk being punished if they don't eradicate the mistakes that so nearly cost them three points.",
      "The return of a few more players could help United, which presents Ten Hag with a welcome conundrum as he tries to select the strongest team. Here are the main talking points:",
      "There is more good news on the injury front, with Sofyan Amrabat and Victor Lindelof both in line to return to the squad today.",
      "Amrabat has not played since the goalless draw with Liverpool on December 17 due to injury and his participation with Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations. Lindelof has been sidelined since December 6 after undergoing groin surgery.",
      "Neither of the players will go into the starting lineup, but they will at least give Ten Hag some more experienced options to call upon from the bench.",
      "Crisis? What crisis? Rasmus Hojlund took a while to adapt to the Premier League, but now it looks like he has finally settled and will only get better.",
      "Like all great goalscorers, the Danish forward was in the right place at the right time to score goals against Newport and Wolves, and he looks full of confidence for the first time in a United shirt.",
      "Hojlund now has three goals and two assists across his last four appearances and is also doing a lot of the dirty work as well. Just as impressive as his goal against Wolves was a brilliant piece of hold-up play in the first half when he used a combination of silk and steel to take the ball past opposition players before unleashing a perfect pass for Marcus Rashford.",
      "We know he can score goals in the Premier League. The next challenge is to do it on a consistent basis.",
      "It is hard to recall any poor performances from Kobbie Mainoo in a United shirt so far. But his worst was certainly the defeat to West Ham two days before Christmas.",
      "The 18-year-old largely looked calm and composed in possession but made a costly error when he failed to control a simple pass to set up Mohammed Kudus for the second goal of the match.",
      "Mainoo has already come a long way since that tough afternoon at the London Stadium, and today he will be looking to prove that those mistakes really are a rarity in his rise to the top.",
      "Speaking of that trip to the London Stadium back in December, it is hard to ignore Kudus again. It felt inevitable he would score in that meeting on a day when former teammate Antony had another performance to forget.",
      "Of all the Ajax players Ten Hag could have signed, Kudus was arguably the one best suited to their attacking line. He cost less than half the price as well.",
      "The Ghanaian is back from the Africa Cup of Nations and won a vital penalty for West Ham on Thursday night, shortly before Antony nearly cost his team with his careless loss of possession that led to a late Wolves equaliser.",
      "United will hope to subdue Kudus this time around, but rather than a battle against Antony, he will have to try and outshine Alejandro Garnacho instead. It'll be a tough ask.",
      "Garnacho has made the right-wing role his own in recent weeks and was excellent from out wide in midweek as well. Many fans would swap Kudus for Antony, but they wouldn't swap him for Garnacho.",
      "United are unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League home games against West Ham (W12 D3), winning each of the last three 1-0. The last team to win four consecutive home games against an opponent by the same scoreline was Sunderland against Man City, who beat them 1-0 four times in a row at the Stadium of Light between 2010 and 2013.",
      "West Ham haven't beaten United in the league at Old Trafford since their famous final-day victory in 2007. It was also the last time they completed a league double against them.",
      "The history books certainly back United to win again today, but recent records provide plenty of doubt. West Ham have earned 17 points from their 11 away league games so far this season (W5 D2 L4), already five more than they earned on the road in the whole of last season.",
      "Old Trafford isn't a fortress either. United have conceded seven goals in their last three Premier League home games, going down 3-0 against Bournemouth, beating Aston Villa 3-2, and drawing 2-2 with Spurs. They’ve not conceded multiple goals in four consecutive home league games since November–January 1971–72.",

      "The 20-year-old endured a difficult start to his Old Trafford career in a team that was losing its way, but although the goals didn't flow for Hojlund, his attitude never changed and he never went missing.",
      "Ten Hag revealed the striker was getting \"angry and mad\" as he went 14 Premier League games without a goal since his summer switch from Atalanta, but after breaking his duck against Aston Villa he has now scored in three successive top-flight games, taking his tally in all competitions to nine this season.",

      "There is a feeling he has been thrown in at the deep end at United, with Anthony Martial suffering from injury and inconsistency and Hojlund taking on the mantle of starting striker when he remained relatively inexperienced, having had a rapid rise in the 18 months since FC Copenhagen sold him to Sturm Graz.",
      "But Ten Hag is beginning to see the traits that convinced him Hojlund was the right man this summer and they are mental attributes as much as physical ones.",
      "\"I can tell you it’s not easy for a striker when you have high expectations from yourself, also the outside world has high expectations, to fulfil that when it’s not working,\" explained Ten Hag.",
      "\"That is the character every striker needs, he gets angry, he gets mad when he’s not scoring, but that’s why we selected him, he has the resilience and the calmness to perform under that stress.",
      "\"He doesn’t have any moment that he wants to give up, he keeps going every time to put himself in the right position. I’m happy he now starts to score, but it counts for many young players there is a lot of space for improvement, but he’s still now on very good levels.\"",
      "Hojlund has scored in Premier League games against Aston Villa, Tottenham and Wolves, as well as finding the net in the FA Cup fourth-round win at Newport County. He also teed up Marcus Rashford for his redemptive opener at Molineux on Thursday and Ten Hag believes there is a partnership forming between his attacking stars.",
      "\"He is a great character, he always keeps going, always wants to improve,\" he said. \"You see now the team is better and more stable, now we serve the front line better and he starts scoring.",
      "\"You see there is something growing with Rashy, with Garnacho, with Bruno, also other players from the second and the third line. He is coming more in a position to score.\"",

      "Making comparisons between established and young players is often not helpful but it's inevitable. Kobbie Mainoo has been likened to Paul Pogba and his performance for Manchester United's Under-21s against Salford City in October intensified the comparisons.",
      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",
      "Mainoo was carefully handled after his return from injury and he featured for the U21s in a handful of games, but it was only a matter of time before Erik ten Hag gave him opportunities.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional since breaking into the first-team this season and he's now one of the first names on the team sheet, which is the ultimate compliment.",
      "Speaking last year shortly after his senior debut, someone who is close to Mainoo confidently said he would play for England and he now has an outside chance of making the Three Lions squad for this summer's European Championship after making just 12 appearances for United.",
      "His progress has been remarkable and he possesses all the attributes to become a world-class talent, just like Pogba did when emerging from the club's academy in the late 2000s.",

      "The Frenchman returned to Old Trafford in 2016 but his second stint wasn't a success and supporters do not remember his time in a red shirt fondly. There is no chance of Mainoo leaving on a free transfer but there is a feeling that the team should be built around him.",
      "United have developed another special talent and he has the temperament and talent to succeed. Mainoo is understood to be quiet, likeable and kept well-grounded by his parents.",
      "There were character issues with Pogba during his time at United and such problems with Mainoo seem highly unlikely to happen. He has the talent to eclipse Pogba's legacy in Manchester and comparisons between himself and Frenkie de Jong have also been merited.",
      "Mainoo has operated as a deep-lying midfielder in the majority of his senior appearances, but those who know him best have suggested his long-term future will be as a No.8.",
      "Adding goals to his game has been privately identified as an area for improvement and his two goals in two games against Newport County and Wolves show he's progressing.",

      "The Danish forward took a while to adapt to the physicality of the Premier League, but now he looks right at home with goals in three successive matches.",
      "What is most pleasing is that the last two goals in particular have been typical predatory finishes, with Hojlund in the right place at the right time to bundle the ball in from close range. He won't get much credit for those goals, but they are exactly the type United haven't been scoring in recent years.",
      "OPINION: Mainoo has done something no other player has done under Ten Hag",
      "Hojlund has also suffered from a lack of consistent support from his teammates so far this season, and it is no surprise his output has picked up at a time when a number of key players returned to the squad. His goal at Wolves, for example, would not have been possible without Luke Shaw in the side.",
      "There is real excitement surrounding Hojlund at the moment, and there is real intrigue about how good he can become after such a promising run of form. Although the answer may intrigue supporters, the club's transfer committee is in dire need of finding it before the summer transfer market opens.",
      "United are in the market for at least two forwards this summer, with Anthony Martial, Jadon Sancho, and Mason Greenwood all set to leave. Facundo Pellistri could also be sold, and Amad might need another loan move too. The jury is also very much out on Antony.",
      "Hojlund's form in the closing months of the season will influence the type of striker United look to add to their squad, as they consider both short-term solutions and long-term additions.",
      "There is still an argument United need another experienced option to help ease the burden on Hojlund, though signing a player currently in their prime would not be good for the player's development.",
      "Likewise, there is also a danger of signing another relatively inexperienced and raw striker, because it could be doubling their problem rather than halving it. This would also cause the issue of trying to develop two players at the same time, something that can't really be done when they only play with one central attacker.",
      "In an ideal world, United would add another experienced option in the same mould as previous signings Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Edinson Cavani this summer, though perhaps one who is slightly younger than those two were when they arrived, respectively.",
      "This would give United a viable alternative to Hojlund in the forward line, but at the same time, they would not have to promise them a key role and regular starts either.",
      "It seems like the best plan for United to reinforce their options this summer, yet in order for it to work, it relies on the Danish forward maintaining his recent level of improvement until the end of the campaign.",

      "Leao only signed a new five-year deal in June meaning that Milan are expected to ask for a big fee. Manchester City have also been linked with an interest in the 24-year-old.",
      "It is claimed that the forward has a release clause of €175 million in his contract, although clubs could try to negotiate a lower fee. His numbers have not been so good this season, having scored six goals in 26 outings.",
      "In other news, Erik ten Hag’s future at United could depend on how much money he is given to spend in the summer transfer window, reports have suggested.",
      "There has been speculation over his future at Old Trafford following the takeover by INEOS. When the summer comes around he will have one year remaining on his current deal after taking over in the summer of 2022, United do have the option of triggering a 12-month extension last year.",
      "The Mirror now suggest that the United boss has been left ‘frustrated’ by being unable to make a loan signing in the January transfer window, despite losing Anthony Martial to injury. The report adds that he feels there has been a ‘lack of consistent backing’ in the transfer market for him to put his own stamp on the squad.",
      "It is said that Ten Hag ‘wants answers’ on whether he will be given money to spend on new signings when the summer transfer window opens United have spent around £400 million on new arrivals since Ten Hag has been in charge.",

      "The academy graduate celebrated his 20th birthday on Friday and is now at an awkward crossroads where he is untested at youth level and needs to be playing regular football at senior level.",
      "Shoretire made his first-team debut at the age of just 17 and still holds the record as the youngest player to represent United in European competition. However, he has struggled to build upon that early promise and has been overtaken in the pecking order by other academy graduates.",
      "LATEST: £150m trio to be removed from Premier League squad after January transfer window",
      "He has trained with the first team consistently in recent weeks and more often than he has at any other point of the season. Yet he has been overlooked.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was the match winner in midweek, a goal that was set up by fellow academy product Omari Forson. They, along with Alejandro Garancho, are the hottest young talents at the club, while Willy Kambwala has also been given opportunities this season.",
      "Shoretire's struggles are a reminder of the cutthroat nature of academy football. A homegrown talent at a club like United is the next best thing until another soon emerges to take their place.",
      "Erik ten Hag has taken on a more hands-on approach with the academy since he joined the club, having felt the U21s were 'isolated' before his arrival. He now takes an active role in deciding which youngsters train with the first team and has set the challenge for at least one youth team player to become part of the first team during every season he's at the club.",
      "The United manager won't give youngsters an opportunity just to keep up traditions, and he has made it clear that only the very best youth prospects will be given a chance in the senior set-up. Mainoo and Garnacho fit the criteria as elite talents; Shoretire should not be ashamed that he doesn't quite fit that bracket anymore.",
      "United are in preliminary talks with Shoretire over a new contract and still hope he agrees to new terms, as they look to protect his value in the increasingly likely scenario where he is sold in the coming years. A loan move was mooted in the January transfer window but never materialised.",
      "While the primary task of the club's illustrious academy is to produce talent for the first team, United also accept that it can be a money-making machine. With current Financial Fair Play rules, it is hugely beneficial to a club to sell homegrown players because the profit on the sale is purely classified as income.",

Anthony Elanga, Zidane Iqbal, Matej Kovar, Teden Mengi, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Laird, Charlie Savage, Noam Emeran, and Marc Jurado were all allowed to leave last summer.",
      "It would make sense if Shoretire was one of the next to join them in exiting the club. He has shone brightly at times, but now it looks to be in the interest of all parties if he were moved on too.",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's fierce shot gave Erik ten Hag's team the lead in the first half, on the occasion of the striker's 21st birthday, before two second-half strikes by Garnacho took the game away from West Ham. Kalvin Phillips made another error for the third goal.",
      "West Ham had 20 shots and might have equalised just before Garnacho's first had Emerson Palmieri capitalised on an error by Harry Maguire on the England defender's return to the team. But David Moyes' men were not clinical and their opponents were.",
      "The result sees Manchester United leapfrog West Ham into sixth spot and build on the momentum of their late winner at Wolves on Thursday evening. It is five unbeaten in all competitions now. Momentum might just be building at Old Trafford.",

      "On the weekend that Old Trafford paid tribute to those who lost their lives in the Munich Air Disaster on February 6 1958, Manchester United were looking to build on their midweek win over Wolves but Moyes' West Ham side made for testing opponents.",
      "Andre Onana was required early on. Set plays are always a threat with James Ward-Prowse on the ball and his right-wing corner found the head of Tomas Soucek, the ball deflecting awkwardly off Edson Alvarez, but the goalkeeper reacted quickly to his left.",
      "In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner.",
      "West Ham had more shots and the better chances in the first half, but their big opportunity came early in the second when Emerson nicked the ball off a sluggish Harry Maguire but proceeded to fire over the bar on the angle of the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United raced straight up the other end to punish that wastefulness. Garnacho's goal owed something to fortune, his left-footed shot was heading straight for goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, on as a substitute, before the ball deflected in off Nayef Aguerd.",
      "It was still not straightforward for Ten Hag and his team. Maguire was caught out again when Jarrod Bowen ran in behind him but Diogo Dalot's saving tackle maintained the two-goal lead. And there was the frustrating sight of Lisandro Martinez going off injured.",
      "But Phillips, on as a substitute after costing his team a goal against Bournemouth in midweek, was then caught out again. Scott McTominay nicked the ball off him in midfield and laid the ball wide for Garnacho to finish expertly with Fabianski flat-footed.",
      "Manchester United have had false dawns before and this was far from a totally dominant display. But, with key players back from injury, two wins in four days have begun to change the complexion of their Premier League season. Upwardly mobile once more?",
      "Ten Hag revealed afterwards the knee injury to Martinez is \"a personal disaster\" for the player. \"I can't say but it doesn't look good,\" said the United boss when speaking in the press conference. \"There is a bad concern. We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis.",
      "\"We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage. He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",

      "Plus: Lack of belief costs West Ham at Man Utd; Nottingham Forest show signs that they can get themselves out of Premier League relegation trouble after draw at Bournemouth",
      "Monday 5 February 2024 13:55, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta praised a string of Arsenal players in his press conference after their 3-1 win over Liverpool. Kai Havertz was \"unbelievable\" up front. Gabriel Martinelli brought a \"streetwise\" edge. But his warmest words were reserved for Jorginho.",
      "\"I always say that he is an example, a role model,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"He has had an issue he has been carrying for months. But he is always the first one in and the last one out. For all the kids at the club, if you want to look at somebody, just look at him.\"",
      "The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods.",
      "His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else.",
      "The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion.",
      "The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data.",
      "But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. \"One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks.\"",
      "He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later.",
      "In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season.",
      "The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism.",
      "Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate",
      "Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier.",
      "Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around.",
      "There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season.",
      "But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale.",
      "For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse.",
      "Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06.",
      "There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker",
      "The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails.",
      "In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over.",
      "Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank.",
      "In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end.",
      "Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display.",
      "Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright",
      "This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession.",
      "Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back.",
      "The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts.",
      "Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager.",
      "Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge.",
      "Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious.",
      "After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread",
      "There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. \"Yes, it could have been more,\" he said.",
      "This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break.",
      "Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints.",
      "The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though.",
      "By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers.",
      "Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long"

      "Erik ten Hag says Lisandro Martinez potentially suffered a \"very bad\" injury in Manchester United's 3-0 win over West Ham on Sunday.",
      "Ten Hag added the injury to Martinez - who only returned from a long-term foot injury last month - is a \"personal disaster\" for the defender.",
      "Martinez suffered the issue when tangling with Vladimir Coufal as he attempted to shield the ball out for a goal-kick in the second half at Old Trafford and was replaced shortly afterwards.",
      "Asked how serious the Argentina international's issue is, Ten Hag said: \"I can't say but it doesn't look good. There is a bad concern.",
      "\"We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis. We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage.",
      "\"He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad, but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, the United boss added: \"It is very bad - very bad for him, very bad for the team. He is a very important player for us.",
      "\"We have centre-backs who can fill in but he brings spirit to the team, apart from his football abilities.\"",
      "Martinez spent nearly three months on the sidelines before returning for the 2-2 draw with Tottenham on January 14.",
      "Since he was brought back into the side, United have remained unbeaten, winning three and drawing one of their four games.",
      "However, they have actually won more points and conceded fewer goals per match without Martinez in the side in the Premier League this season.",
      "United are well-stocked at centre-back should Martinez remain absent in the long term, with Ten Hag able to call on Raphael Varane, Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, who returned to the squad after injury on Sunday.",
      "West Ham boss David Moyes said Martinez made \"a huge difference\" for United, explaining: \"He brings much greater calmness on the ball in their build-up play.",
      "\"I am not an expert on Manchester United but I think that makes them look more comfortable.\"",
      "Moyes even highlighted a key moment in the game when Emerson was running through on the angle after dispossessing Harry Maguire.",

      "Manchester United have won four out of their last six games, with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo impressing; both teenagers have stepped up for Erik ten Hag ahead of the season run-in;  watch Man Utd vs West Ham live on Sky Sports this Sunday from 1pm; kick-off 2pm",
      "Sunday 4 February 2024 12:28, UK",
      "If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season.",
      "The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive.",
      "Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa.",
      "And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most.",
      "Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars.",
      "The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. \"His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,\" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance.",
      "Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot.",
      "Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other.",
      "But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle.",
      "In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career.",
      "And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out.",
      "The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords.",
      "In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left.",
      "The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player.",
      "It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals.",
      "Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack.",
      "But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four.",
      "The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for.",
      "Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season.",
      "Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.",

      "Saturday 3 February 2024 10:23, UK",
      "After an agonising midweek of bad beats, Jones Knows is hoping to punish the bookmakers with his weekend 6/1 treble.",
      "Punters are the kings at talking through their pocket. No group of people do it better. So pardon the frustration that's about to let rip regarding the two losing bets from the midweek action. Somehow both 8/1 shots lost.",
      "I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore.",
      "Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down.",
      "Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter.",
      "We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down.",
      "This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi.",
      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",
      "Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more.",
      "Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 4/5 on 50+ booking points looks a winner in waiting to me.",

      "Friday 2 February 2024 14:03, UK",
      "Kobbie Mainoo scored a sensational 97th-minute winner for Manchester United after Wolves themselves had levelled in stoppage time in a stunning 4-3 game at Molineux.",
      "Marcus Rashford, restored to the team, opened the scoring and Rasmus Hojlund doubled the lead before the break with United dominant but the drama had hardly begun.",
      "Pablo Sarabia pulled one back from the spot before another substitute, Scott McTominay restored the two-goal advantage. Max Kilman's late goal offered Wolves hope and Pedro Neto thought he had secured a point before Mainoo's magnificent winner.",
      "It was a breathless contest to ultimately delight the visiting Manchester United support, although even the crestfallen home team were applauded from the pitch.",
      "Wolves had not lost at home since being beaten by Liverpool in September and could have moved above United with victory. Instead, they remain 11th in the table while Ten Hag's team are up to seventh.",

      "Ten Hag said before kick-off that this might be Manchester United's strongest side and things would look different once the injured players had returned and they played as if that were true during the opening period, scoring before Wolves had really had a kick.",
      "Hojlund laid the ball off to Rashford and the returning favourite caressed the ball beyond Jose Sa and into the corner of the net. It oozed cool and made a mockery of the fuss that has surrounded him all week. United just seemed to grow in confidence thereafter.",
      "Wolves were tactically undone for the second goal, Neto failing to track the powerful off-the-ball run of Luke Shaw and when Rashford slipped him in, the full-back's low cross was bundled into the net by Hojlund after earlier ricocheting off Craig Dawson and Sa.",
      "Hojlund almost had another when Matt Doherty's under-hit pass to the goalkeeper resulted in the clearance cannoning off him but just wide. The Denmark forward was then denied when a narrow offside decision went against him after tucking the ball away late in the first half.",
      "Casemiro, booked early on but otherwise restoring control to United's midfield, found the net with a header before that half was through but was again offside and the onus was on O'Neil to change things at the break. The tone of the game certainly shifted.",
      "Kilman had a header cleared from near the line by Lisandro Martinez, making his first Premier League start since September. Hojlund then spurned a good chance after an error by Toti Gomes. But the penalty offered Wolves a route back into it.",
      "The decision to award the spot-kick was soft, Casemiro barely connecting with Neto - if at all. But Sarabia, on as a substitute, converted and the crowd were in the game. United struck again. McTominay did not even have to jump to nod in United's third from a corner.",
      "Again, Wolves fought back. They showed real spirit in the second half, defending that long unbeaten run at home. Dawson's miscued shot was turned in by Kilman to set up a big finish. Neto delivered it when United inexplicably allowed a counter-attack.",
      "His shot appeared to wrong-foot Andre Onana and Molineux was wild, dreaming of an unlikely winner of their own. But, amid a raucous atmosphere, it was Mainoo who was calm while others were not, skipping away from two before curling effortlessly into the corner.",
      "It was a goal that will be talked about for years, the biggest moment of his fledgling career to date - and a big moment for his manager and team. Had United let this slip, it would have been damning. But this was a night to remember for the right reasons, instead.",
      "\"To be honest, I have mixed feelings,\" said Ten Hag. \"For the neutral, for the spectator, it is great to see. But as a manager, when you have dominated for an hour and should be three or four up, the way we concede the goals, we should manage it better, it cannot happen.\"",
      "\"Incredibly proud of some of what we produced, the resilience, the togetherness, the quality, there were large spells when we looked close to being an excellent team,\" said the Wolves boss. \"There were little bits that we need to improve, obviously.\"",
      "He added: \"The two goals in the second half, very disappointing as it is down to detail. The throw-in at the end is not how we defend throw-ins.",
      "\"You are tested in the Premier League, the emotion of it. We go completely off plan [after Rashford's early goal] and start opening up big spaces. But in terms of the togetherness, the work ethic, I thought second half, we were by far the better side.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Gary Neville:",

      "Plus from Wednesday: Connor Bradley steals the show as Liverpool beat Chelsea; Julian Alvarez grabs the headlines as Erling Haaland returns for Man City in their win over Burnley; Timo Werner shows the value of Tottenham conducting their transfer business early as he helps beat Brentford",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 00:50, UK",
      "“He’s making incredible progress. He is the modern midfield player.” Erik ten Hag was effusive in his praise for Kobbie Mainoo after his dramatic winner at Wolves - and understandably so.",
      "Casemiro. Fred. Donny van de Beek. Nemanja Matic. So many millions have been spent by Manchester United as they tried to find a player to command their midfield. Now, it seems an answer may have sprung from their academy.",
      "To prove Ten Hag’s point, Mainoo excelled in attack and defence at Molineux, ranking joint-first among United players for possession wins (six) while also sealing the points with a goal of rare composure.",
      "It’s already clear Mainoo is part of United’s strongest XI. He offers more physicality than Christian Eriksen, more skill than Scott McTominay and more dynamism than Casemiro.",
      "If Mainoo maintains his current trajectory, it’s not unreasonable to think he could even sneak into an England squad that is not exactly blessed with midfielders at the peak of their form.",
      "But even if he falls short in that aim, the 18-year-old looks as though he has saved United a fortune in the transfer market.Joe Shread",
      "Gary O'Neil spent much of his post-match press conference discussing the challenge of trying - and ultimately failing - to bring in another striker this transfer window but Wolves managed to score three goals against Manchester United and still lost.",
      "It was the details that cost them. The third goal from a corner was routine and the fourth goal came from a throw-in. Wolves appeared caught up in the emotion of the game, while Mainoo was the coolest character in the stadium. It proved the difference.",
      "O'Neil prides himself on those tactical details, which is perhaps why he was so frustrated that his match-preparation time had been disrupted by trying to get a deal over the line. He described having a game on deadline day as a \"terrible idea\" afterwards.",
      "But if there was some comfort in being beaten at home for the first time in over four months it was that even in a sloppy performance, there was a spirit, a work ethic, the sort of togetherness that has his team in mid-table rather than facing the drop as some expected.",
      "Wolves have served up some drama already at Molineux this season, beating Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. They came out on the wrong side of this seven-goal thriller but it said plenty that their players were applauded off the pitch at the end of the game.Adam Bate",
      "David Moyes threw Kalvin Phillips in at the deep and to a certain extent it backfired, but having not made a single start in the Premier League this season for Man City, the England international was always going to take time to get up to speed.",
      "He endured a nightmare start to his West Ham debut, playing the ball straight to Dominic Solanke to score Bournemouth's opener. His struggles continued during the first half and an off-the-pace Phillips was eventually replaced in the 68th minute by Danny Ings.",
      "However, Phillips' lack of sharpness was probably understandable considering his bit-part role at Man City over the last couple of years.",
      "What is important now is how the 28-year-old improves from here. He's been crying out for minutes, particularly as he tries to win a place in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer.",
      "After his first start against Bournemouth, he will be hoping more follow and that he can build and improve quickly.Oliver Yew",
      "David Moyes' pre- and post-match commentary was telling. \"We've had to rejig,\" he said before kick-off, in reference to Kalvin Phillips' inclusion. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\" he conceded after the full-time whistle.",
      "The teamsheet looked imbalanced from the off. Four central midfielders and no striker. Of course Moyes has been hamstrung by injuries and absences in recent weeks, but attempting to crowbar four midfielders into the starting XI caused more harm than good against high-pressing Bournemouth.",
      "Phillips looked lost. Edson Alvarez was scrappy and ineffective. Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse were better, but ever-changing shape restricted their influence. Debutant Phillips registered an error leading to a goal with only his second touch in a Hammers shirt - it was all a bit messy and confused.",
      "That will be the first and last time we'll see that midfield concoction this season, or ever. Question is, where does Phillips fit now? West Ham's central trio - Alvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek - have forged good connections in the first half of this season. Why disrupt it unnecessarily?Laura Hunter",
      "The roar that greeted Conor Bradley's goal in Liverpool's 4-1 win over Chelsea was that little bit louder than the rest. It was a reward for his fine form since coming into the side but it was also a reminder that Jurgen Klopp is building an exciting new team.",
      "Bradley has looked assured defensively, combative in the tackle, impressive in possession and has now shown a finishing ability that Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez would envy. He is more than filling in for Trent Alexander-Arnold. He was a worthy player of the match.",
      "With two assists as well as his goal, the Northern Ireland international has certainly won over the Anfield crowd - they chanted his name more than once on the night. He looks like a strength rather than a weakness, highlighting the depth in this squad now.",
      "That gives Klopp options, the opportunity to deploy Alexander-Arnold in midfield rather than at right-back, for instance. Expect him to have a big impact this season and beyond. At a time when the focus is on Liverpool stories coming to an end, another is just beginning.Adam Bate",
      "Once again, it's two steps forward, two steps back for Chelsea. After winning three in a row in the Premier League for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino, his side produced a woeful display at Anfield.",
      "It was the same in November, when Chelsea followed up impressive results against Tottenham and Manchester City by getting thrashed at Newcastle.",
      "But even more worrying than the inconsistency - or the one-sided result - was the nature of Chelsea's performance against Liverpool.",
      "Jurgen Klopp's side were predictably fired up in their first Premier League game since he announced his planned exit, but it seemingly caught Chelsea by surprise.",
      "The visitors were second to everything. They continuously gave the ball away in dangerous areas. They lost their runners.",
      "Investing in youth has had the predictable consequence of leaving Chelsea short of two vital components that make up successful teams - experience and leadership.",
      "Never was it more apparent than on Wednesday night.Joe Shread",
      "Erling Haaland's return from injury against Burnley was a major boost for Manchester City. His second-half introduction was cheered as loudly as any of their goals. But it was Julian Alvarez who inflicted most of the damage on the night.",
      "His double, scored in the space of six first-half minutes, took him to eight for the campaign in the Premier League and 15 overall. He also has six assists. He is quietly having an excellent season.",
      "And yet a look at the statistics on Wednesday night suggests he did little other than score. The Argentine only had 24 touches, by far the fewest of City's starters, and only completed 12 passes. His goals came from his only two shots of the night.",
      "The Argentine is an atypical Manchester City player, low-touch but high-efficiency, and it is that streamlined effectiveness that makes him so important to Pep Guardiola. Alvarez is not the beating heart of this team but he almost always affects games.",
      "It is for that reason that he has become so prominent. In the Premier League so far this season, the 24-year-old is the only Manchester City player to have started all 21 games.",
      "The assumption is that Haaland's return will bump him out of the team. But do not be surprised if Guardiola continues to find room for him. This was just one of many games this season in which he has underlined his importance.Nick Wright",
      "With James Maddison making his first start since November, the England international was all set to grab the headlines, but it was Timo Werner who impressed most in attack.",
      "The German was a constant threat down the left and caused Brentford plenty of problems, grabbing an assist for the second goal.",
      "His eye-catching performance drew praise from Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "\"I thought he was great,\" the Australian said. \"He's a quality player. As he gets stronger and fitter and understands our game a little bit better, I think he'll become even more effective.",
      "\"I know there's goals in him as well and that will come with time.\"",
      "Spurs usually leave their business towards the end of the transfer window but this month they acted early by bringing in Werner on loan, and that swift action is paying off.Declan Olley",

      "Prior to his Forest stint, Lingard had an eye-catching loan spell with West Ham in 2021, scoring nine goals in 16 games.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been the focus of yet another disciplinary breach at Man Utd; this is the third time the England forward has clashed with Erik ten Hag over transgressions; INEOS want to introduce a culture change at Manchester United, but will Rashford's behaviour fit into it?",
      "Wednesday 31 January 2024 09:47, UK",
      "If the words in Manchester United's statement on Marcus Rashford, released late on Monday night, sounded familiar, it is not a trick of the mind.",
      "Two months ago, when the England international partied at Chinawhite nightclub after the derby undressing against Manchester City, Erik ten Hag said \"he apologised and that is it. It is an internal matter\".",
      "The location and context has changed - Rashford reporting himself ill for training last Friday after going out in Belfast the previous two nights - but the protagonist and United's communication remains the same.",
      "Erik ten Hag will face the media at 12.30pm on Wednesday - follow it live on the Sky Sports app and website.",
      "\"Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions,\" read the club's statement. \"This has been dealt with as an internal disciplinary matter, which is now closed.\"",
      "Rashford has to ensure it is indeed shut - and not just for a matter of weeks. It is the third time the 26-year-old has been caught transgressing under Ten Hag, the first of which was arriving late for a team meeting.",
      "That seemed innocuous, but his actions since have sparked concerns - even before the tequila-filled details of Thursday emerged from an alleged eyewitness account.",
      "It's not solely Rashford's focus that is in question, but a harsher spotlight is now on the continuous off-field issues at United.",
      "It was during September, in the immediate aftermath of Jadon Sancho's social media offensive against being a \"scapegoat\", that warnings of misbehaviour from other members of the squad began to circulate.",
      "Several privy to the winger's anger at being singled out, isolated, and effectively cancelled at the club before rejoining Borussia Dortmund on loan, insisted there were players flouting Ten Hag's standards at Carrington and beyond.",
      "When Rashford was celebrating at Chinawhite in the early morning despite needing to report to training at the end of October, it was flagged as an example.",
      "However, the incident was brushed aside as a one-off by people close to the forward; it was simply a pre-arranged birthday party.",
      "Ten Hag had also insisted Rashford was \"very motivated to put things right. I know how much effort he is putting in. He makes a mistake but that doesn't say he is not fitting in.",
      "\"He is totally with us. He makes one mistake but also off the pitch what he is doing, how he lives, I am sure he is doing everything right to help the team and to perform and let us win.\"",
      "Managers do not take well to having their authority undermined, being misled, and let down after publicly standing up for a player.",
      "Rashford's repeated eroding of the standards and rules set under the Dutchman is set to send him on a collision course with Ten Hag, but he is also at high risk of clashing with the \"clean culture\" INEOS aim to implement under their sporting control.",
      "As Sky Sports revealed in December, Sir Jim Ratcliffe will implement a more ruthless approach to United's process over player contracts in a bid to prioritise the right ethos and recruitment strategy over business interests.",
      "United want to be more \"culture-focused\" in their decision-making and have noted Arsenal as an example where cutting ties with players instead of trying to hold out for a fee can help reshape a squad and develop an environment of healthy habits and success.",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, on United's board and still wading through an audit of the club's football operations, addressed the squad on Monday. He talked them through the INEOS plan of creating an \"ecosystem of excellence\" and how that can only be achieved through total investment from the players, collaborative effort and discipline.",
      "That speech came amid Rashford and his brother/agent Dwaine Maynard meeting with Ten Hag and football director John Murtough, to get a handle on the striker's behaviour.",
      "Rashford means more than most to United, and they have been doing the most to crack the conundrum of what is going on with him. Some at the club feel he just needs a reconfiguring, to be honest with himself about what is truly important and of value to him.",
      "It is interesting to remember what Rashford himself has said about performance less than a year ago. \"Football is probably 95 per cent your mentality. That gives you the baseline to perform. There are a lot of players that have ability - that's why they play at the top level. But what sets them apart is the mentality. I've been on both sides of it.",
      "\"I understand the strength of it and the value. I'm concentrating a lot more on keeping myself in that headspace and it's needed in order to win games and trophies.\"",
      "It is unsurprising that United have sharply moved to draw a line under the misdemeanour. The club have been beset with off-pitch drama in various shapes and at levels of seriousness.",
      "They can ill afford to add another high-profile name and situation to the list. The control for that is out of United's hands though and in Rashford's. He has to show the club, his manager, the supporters and INEOS that he can be trusted.",
      "And that is before his performances even enter the equation. Rashford was in the form of his life last season, top-scoring for United with 30 goals following an inconsistent 18-month stretch hampered by residual shoulder pain.",
      "His return reads four so far this term, in a struggling team desperate for his brilliance when the manager's future and direction of the club is uncertain.",
      "It has been emphasised that if Rashford was still prolific, there would be no fuss over what he was getting up to away from training and matches.",
      "The counter to that is a thread Ten Hag has often stated: what happens on the pitch is a direct result of how you're applying yourself off it. \"I demand the highest standards in sleep, recovery and nutrition because that makes the difference if you can perform every third or fourth day,\" the manager has stated.",
      "He also believes that if you do not respect training in the modern era, you cannot master matches.",
      "Rashford has actually agreed with Ten Hag on this. When he was dropped to the bench against Wolves for arriving late to a team meeting, his assessment was as follows: \"If I was a coach, I'd have done the same. Because if you don't have standards in the training ground, how do you expect to go out on the pitch and win consistently? It's impossible.",
      "\"If you're going to allow each other to slip or have an off day and no one says anything about it … which is at times a position that we've been in.",
      "\"And once you're in it it's difficult to get out of it because it becomes normal and I've not seen it at this club before. It was a little bit strange and it's even more strange when you're involved in it [at Wolves]. So it's constant reminders about discipline.\"",
      "He needs to get his own memos. Rashford will mark eight years in the first team next month. He is in the highest bracket of its earners. Seen as the reference point, it's time to permanently start acting like it again.",
