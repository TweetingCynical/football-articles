      "The agent of Sporting CP star Viktor Gyokeres has reportedly taken a giant leap towards landing his client a Premier League transfer. And it isn't good news for Manchester United fans after the player's agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, is understood to have met with Arsenal's owners.",
      "Things have seemingly taken a sour turn in Lisbon very quickly after it emerged Gyokeres was not happy with Sporting, where he has become an icon in two seasons. It's alleged the Sweden striker was under the impression a 'gentleman's agreement' would allow him to leave for around £59million this summer.",
      "But after scoring 97 times in 102 appearances for the Lions, it seems Sporting are intent on receiving the full value of his £85m release clause if he's to leave. And it's led to claims Gyokeres will go on strike if needed in order to force through a dream move this summer.",
      "CNN Portugal reported Cetinkaya met with Arsenal's owners on Wednesday in an effort to expedite a deal. The Gunners reportedly sent a delegation to Lisbon last month to discuss a potential move for Sporting's prolific frontman.",
      "The update suggests talks between the two parties are \"very advanced.\" And although Arsenal's representatives have met with Sporting in the past, it's understood matters are now looking more formal ahead of a potential deal being struck.",
      "It's also suggested that a move to the Emirates Stadium has been Gyokeres' preference \"from the very beginning.\" And it could mean United boss Ruben Amorim, the man who brought him to Portugal from Coventry City, is left out in the cold.",
      "Gyokeres' inner circle have already made it clear they want him to remain in Lisbon. The player's uncle, Chris, revealed at the Taca de Portugal final, where Gyokeres forced extra time before lifting the title, that the family encouraged their star to stick in his current surroundings.",
      "When asked if the family felt a connection to Lisbon, he told Sport.TV: \"Yes, very much. Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "Not only that, but Gyokeres' girlfriend, Ines Aguiar, has also campaigned for him to stick around. According to A Bola, she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to commit to a third season with Sporting despite the swell of transfer interest.",
      "Gyokeres recently ruled out a return to his home nation and told Swedish Vogue: \"After living in a warm country, it would be difficult. In Sweden, people work hard during the week and only socialize on the weekends. Here there is more life during the week. They have dinners with friends, a glass of wine on Monday. I like that.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta's side may have left United in their wake after seemingly moving ahead in discussions. Arsenal appear to be intent on making up for last year's shortcomings by signing an elite striker this summer.",
      "Injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus left the club short last season despite calls to add to their forward department. And it left new signing Mikel Merino with the responsibility of leading the line for much of this season.",
      "The Spaniard did well in his makeshift role and scored 10 goals between January and May. However, the Gunners are under no illusion that a more natural talent is required up top, and the benefit of offering Champions League football is a major advantage over United.",
      "The same can be said for United after a record-low finish of 15th in the Premier League. The likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have failed to set the world alight as hoped at Old Trafford, with Amorim now seeking to make his own mark on the squad.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, isn't the only forward target believed to be on Arsenal's radar. The club has been closely linked with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko this summer, with the club's hierarchy seemingly keen on the Slovenia international.",
      "However, recent developments would suggest Gyokeres remains the preferred pick if the Gunners get their way. And it may mean United are left devastated as a direct rival hoovers up one of the most coveted talents on the market."

      "Chelsea made their decision to not make Sancho's move permanent official as they named their Club World Cup squad on Wednesday. The Blues were forced to stump up £5million to send the winger back to United after they had satisfied condititions to make the deal permanent.",
      "Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all keeping tabs on the 25-year-old's situation as the Red Devils look to facilitate an exit. Unai Emery's side prefer a loan deal for the ex-Borussia Dortmund star, having taken Marcus Rashford on a temporary basis in January.",
      "United would prefer a sale to bolster their funds amidst a busy summer of rebuilding, as they attempt to replenish Amorim's squad. Already the club have spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and a significant fee is expected to land Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sancho would see a return to Champions League action if a move to Newcastle or Tottenham was completed. It is claimed the sides both see Sancho as 'a strong option' as they attempt to build squads to battle on multiple fronts in 2025/26.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star, who has also drawn interest from his former club, enjoyed a steady if unspectacular loan at Chelsea last term. Sancho made 45 appearances as he helped Chelsea win the UEFA Conference League and qualify for the Champions League.",

      "Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas has claimed that blackmail and threats will not force him to agree to a transfer for Viktor Gyokeres. It has been said that the forward is willing to go on strike after he believed the club had went back on their word over the fee they were willing to accept for a move.",
      "Gyokeres has drawn interest from across Europe and the Saudi Pro League, with Arsenal and Manchester United among contenders for his signature. The 27-year-old is thought to prefer a move to the Premier League.",
      "But Varandas has denied he agreed to allow Gyokeres to leave if an offer reaching £60million arrived for the Swedish striker. And the president has suggested there has yet to be an offer on the table for his prize asset, despite him hitting more than 50 goals last term.",
      "\"One thing you should already know is me better,\" said Varandas, per Record. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Gyokeres' fury is said to stem from his belief that the Portuguese giants are demanding £67m, a figure almost £10m more than he expected. While Varandas accepted the club will not demand the player's release clause be activated, he attempted to explain what he considers the truth of the agreement made with Gyokeres' agent.",
      "New Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana played a crucial role, while he was still with Sporting, before Varandas was required to enter negotiations.",
      "\"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season,\" Varandas explained.",
      "\"During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him. When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.",
      "\"Viana manages the relationship with the agents, and very well, this is done by the sporting director. One of the agent's biggest concerns was whether we would demand the value of the €100m (£85m) clause next year.",
      "\"Viana negotiated with the agents over several meetings, until the agent himself asked for the president's presence to settle the matter once and for all. The issue of the bonus for 'x' goals seemed reasonable and at that meeting, where the president, the agent and Viana were present, no player was present, Viktor was not present, the agent wanted to guarantee certain things.\"",
      "\"It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the following season, especially because he was going to be 27. Then, we knew Viktor's dream of going to a club where he could fight for the Champions League and we have common sense.",
      "\"We guaranteed that we would not demand €100m. In that meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the departure to a value, he spoke of €60m, €70m... And I said 'there's no point in setting a value because I don't know what will happen here in a year, if he gets injured, if he has a disappointing season... There's no point in setting a value, I don't know if it will be €40m, €60m or €80m (£34, £51 or £68m). What I can guarantee is that I will not demand €100m'.",
      "\"From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures and values. 10 months have passed and I see the agent in the press spouting information here and there, but Sporting has common sense, it keeps its word. The president of Sporting said that the club would not demand the clause and that we would adjust the value to Viktor's performance, he was one of the best players ever to step on the pitch in Portugal.\"",

      "Manchester United legends Dwight Yorke and Paul Scholes agree that the club must sign Eberechi Eze for £68million this summer. Eze, 26, has been outstanding since joining Crystal Palace in 2020 and enjoyed his best season to date in 2024/25.",
      "The playmaker scored 14 goals and registered 11 assists for Oliver Glasner’s side, including netting the winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City to hand the Eagles their first-ever major trophy. That impressive form has seen the England international linked with rival Premier League clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "And during England’s 3-1 defeat to Senegal on Tuesday, where Eze played the full 90 minutes, United hero Scholes saw enough evidence to believe he would thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "Taking to Instagram during the game, Scholes posted a picture of Eze in an England shirt with a three-word transfer plea, telling United bosses to: “Just buy him.”",
      "Eze reportedly has a £68m release clause in his Palace contract, which can be activated this summer. Speaking last month, Scholes’ former Red Devils team-mate, Dwight Yorke, also urged United to make a move for the player.",
      "“Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace would be perfect for Manchester United,\" Yorke said. “Yeah, he scored at the weekend in the FA Cup final, but it’s not just about that. A year ago, maybe more, I said this kid and Michael Olise – who went to Bayern – United should buy them for £100 million.",
      "“Put £100m down and you will get two fantastic players. Instead, they listened to the figures in the hierarchy, which is understandable, but it’s glaring just how good these two are.",
      "“Eze has the decision-making, the talent, he’s a good athlete, he can create and score. He’s at the right age to step up and play on a bigger platform. It’s a no-brainer.”",
      "Former QPR talent Eze was outstanding again for England this week despite a woeful overall team performance. He stood out in a central role, winning the ball back from Lamine Camara in the lead-up to England’s opening goal.",
      "But he truly came alive after the hour mark, combining excellently with substitutes Morgan Gibbs-White and Morgan Rogers by being at the heart of England’s best period of the game.",
      "Despite excelling in a No. 10 role, Eze would likely play just behind the striker in Ruben Amorim’s trademark 3-4-2-1 formation if United manage to sign him. Any such deal could also see him partner up with the likes of Bruno Fernandes and new signing Matheus Cunha to form an exciting new front three.",
      "United are, however, prioritising the signing of a new striker and appear to be settled on going for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo over the likes of other attack-minded midfielders like Eze after it was revealed that Fernandes would stay at the club this summer.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is believed to be their number one target, though United have also been linked with Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko to a lesser extent.",

      "Frank is a coach rather than a manger and will be tasked with improving the squad at his disposal. But after the Lilywhites finished in 17th position, the 51-year-old will rarely have a stronger position to negotiate from over what he requires in the transfer market.",
      "There will be key decisions to make over a number of players with the future of captain Son Heung-min a hot topic. But Tottenham technical director Johan Lange will be the figure heading up much of the recruitment, possibly alongside a returning Fabio Paratici.",
      "With a return to Champions League football to manage in addition to the battles of the Premier League, the pressure will be on Frank to deliver on both fronts. And perhaps a new player or two can help boost Spurs' numbers and quality ahead of a better season.",
      "Guglielmo Vicario is set to remain the club's No.1 with the likes of January signing Antonin Kinsky to provide back-up. Goalkeepers Fraser Forster, 37, and Alfie Whiteman, 26, are both set to be released at the expiry of their contracts.",
      "The Spurs backline will see Kevin Danso make his loan move permanent this summer after arriving amidst the club's injury nightmare midway through the season. Already there is some competition with talented stars such as Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Radu Dragusin at Frank's disposal.",
      "With Dragusin still recovering from an ACL injury and Romero being linked to a possible exit for Atletico Madrid, perhaps there is room for another however. Spurs have already been linked to Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, AS Roma defender Evan Ndicka and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi.",
      "If Spurs can take advantage of Guehi entering the final year of his contract with the Eagles, perhaps he his most likely to slip into a backline including Pedro Porro, Van de Ven and Destiny Udogie.",
      "In midfield Frank will have talented youngsters to choose from in Lucas Bergvall and Pape Matar Sarr, while only one of older options Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur is likely to extend their stay via a new contract. The latter could help provide a base alongside Sarr if Spurs plan to stick with the players they have.",
      "Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze have both drawn interest from Tottenham but could prove difficult to prise away from Selhurst Park ahead of Oliver Glasner's side heading into Europe and being notoriously tough negotiators. With James Maddison already in the squad, Frank has an option to play in an advanced role and Dejan Kulusevski could also thrive in such a position.",
      "Across Spurs' frontline a familiar face could arrive in the form of Bryan Mbeumo to provide plenty of goalscoring threat from the right side. Frank is said to have asked for the Cameroon international to follow him from Brentford.",
      "On the opposite flank could be Son Heung-min but after securing his place as a Spurs legend by virtue of finally winning a trophy, he could find new competition. Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo is of interest to Tottenham and would appear to fit in with Frank's philosophies.",
      "Up front, Dominic Solanke is the obvious option to lead the frontline. Son could provide some support in that position throughout the season, in addition to Richarlison but Solanke will be handed the responsibility.",
      "Dream Tottenham XI: Vicario; Porro, Guehi, Van de Ven, Udogie; Bentancur, Sarr; Mbeumo, Kulusevski, Semenyo; Solanke.",

United have slapped a £70million asking price on Garnacho in the hope he can help fund their summer rebuild, but even if he does leave for a big fee, the winger will do so having fallen short of Ten Hag’s expectations.",
      "Thankfully for United, there are interested parties, with Napoli, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all monitoring his situation. The 20-year-old returned 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games last season and his value is helped by the fact he is under contract until June 2028.",
      "It is that contract, worth £50,000-a-week and signed in May 2023, which prompted a challenge from Garnacho’s former manager, Ten Hag. While congratulating him on his deserved deal, the Dutchman - who is now reportedly among the managers that want to sign him - warned that it would lead to increased expectation.",
      "“First of all, I think he has the prize and it’s a prize,” he said. “He also shows he can make the final step – not only in talent but also, he made it. But now it’s a new start, a restart, because now the expectations will be higher, the demands definitely will be higher.",
      "“He is on his way, he is a strong character and that’s why he’s there in the moment on this level, and he did it by himself. But now is coming more work to go because the demands are higher, we expect more from him. But it’s great he made it because it tells we will give young players opportunities, but they have to deserve it.",
      "“When I say ‘give’, translate it to ‘deserve’ and they have to deserve with their feet, they have to show it on the pitch and that means you have to invest a lot and deserve it by training performances, by performance in the under-21s, then wait for your moment and prove it again.",
      "“For Alejandro, he is that step beyond but now the demands will be even more because he has now to compete for a starting XI position. So, every time is the same: you have to cross limits and every time you have to go in the next level. We go with him in that challenge but most important is the player has to do it.”",

      "Ten Hag bought two players with him from the Amsterdam club when he arrived three years ago, with Antony joining Lisandro Martinez, while fellow Dutchman Tyrell Malacia signing from Feyenoord. Last year he signed his old Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "But Antony in particular struggled to repay that huge transfer fee and was heavily criticised over his inconsistent performances.

      "Now it's claimed Ten Hag never wanted to bring Antony to United in the first place and attempted to pull the breaks on the transfer, despite previous suggestions he was key to the move happening.",
      "The claim also suggests United pushed through with the move after learning Arsenal were set to make an approach for the player - but Ten Hag still supported him and tried to help him during his time at the club.",

      "\"I'm working so hard to make sure that I achieve my dream of playing in the Premier League someday but, like I said, it's a process and I just want to keep on this momentum and continue to do well.\"",
      "Although it has not deterred Matheus Cunha from joining United and Mbeumo wanting to join him at Old Trafford, a lack of European football next season could hinder United's chances of attracting Osimhen. He has not gone a season without playing in Europe since 2018/19.",
      "Recently the subject of interest from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, Osimhen is also likely to command big wages and that could be an issue.",

      "Admired by Napoli and head coach Antonio Conte, it remains to be seen if the Serie A champions will make a fresh approach for Garnacho this summer. If they have retained their interest and show a strong desire to take him to Naples, Osimhen might creep into United's thoughts when negotiating.",

      "Despite this plea, United remain chasing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. While they are in the hotseat for the Cameroonian, Thomas Frank's impending move to Tottenham Hotspur could complicate matters.",
      "Meanwhile, the race for Viktor Gyokeres took another turn this week as Sporting declared that they had not promised their striker that he could leave at a reduced rate this summer. A new, higher fee for the Swede could make his signature a difficult one to tie down but if his heart is set on a move, the Lisbon club may have to let him go.",
      "Keep across all the Manchester United transfer updates in our live blog below...",

      "The summer transfer window temporarily closed on Tuesday evening and will not reopen until next Monday, meaning no activity will take place in M16 over the next few days.",
      "However, United are understood to remain in discussions with Brentford about attempting to sign Mbeumo. They are expected to table a fresh bid after their opening offer of £55million was knocked back last week.",
      "If United successfully add Mbeumo to their attack, it would mark a second statement signing of the summer following the addition of Cunha on June 1. He arrived in Manchester after United triggered his £62.5m release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "With United set to focus on attempting to wrap up the signing of Mbeumo once the window reopens next week, they will then have to switch their focus to outgoings to fund further additions. United want to strengthen a handful of other areas ahead of next season.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what United's strongest matchday squad could look like come the end of the window.",
      "Despite wanting a new goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot, the Cameroonian is still likely to retain top spot in the pecking order and start next season as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir is likely to leave and Amorim will want an upgrade on him to provide competition for Onana.",
      "As far as the back-three is concerned, Amorim, once everyone is fit, will be spoilt for choice. United are well-stocked at centre-back and every member of that department will believe they are worthy of starting, meaning pre-season performances could dictate who gets the nod in August.",
      "Currently, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, who both have bright futures ahead of them, are the most likely options to start in the two wide centre-back roles, meaning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt will compete to start in between them.",
      "If United sign Mbeumo, Amad is an obvious pick at right wing-back. The Ivorian was a rare bright spark in 2024/25 and should be one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "In the opposite wing-back berth, Patrick Dorgu is currently a shoo-in after arriving from Lecce earlier this year. He will only get better with time and games.",
      "In the centre of midfield, Bruno Fernandes is an obvious starter. He is highly likely to occupy one of the two No.8 positions amid Cunha's arrival and the expectation he will operate from the left-sided No.10 position.",
      "However, there is an element of uncertainty surrounding who could occupy the midfield spot next to him. United want to sign a new midfielder this summer, but they are yet to have identified a firm target, with outgoings set to determine how big a budget they have.",
      "As things stand, Manuel Ugarte is the most obvious candidate to operate next to Fernandes. He will be able to do the dirty side of the game, allowing the United skipper to advance into forward areas.",
      "As far as the two No.10 positions are concerned, they should be occupied by Mbeumo and Cunha. The latter is a specialist in his role and Mbeumo has the versatility to adapt having predominantly played as a right-winger at Brentford.",
      "The biggest void in need of filling in United's starting XI, of course, is at No.9. They are desperate for a striker and have been forced to alter their plans after missing out on Liam Delap.",
      "Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres would be the dream signing for most United supporters amid his outstanding goalscoring record in Portugal and his relationship with Amorim. He ticks several boxes and would bring a proven goalscoring record to Old Trafford.",
      "However, United's chances of signing him will once again rest on outgoings and generating funds via sales. United do have a collection of players they want to move on.",
      "With United targeting a new goalkeeper to compete with Onana, they could do worse than targeting Leicester City shot-stopper Mads Hermansen following their relegation to the Championship. Their financial difficulties could mean they may have to sanction a cut-price deal.",
      "Defensive cover could be provided by Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and one of Maguire or De Ligt. United are also reasonably well-stocked in midfield, meaning cover could come from Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi could offer attacking cover. Rasmus Hojlund would be an option for the bench if retained.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha, Gyokeres.",

Rashford missed the end of the season at Aston Villa with a hamstring injury, but he showed enough during his temporary stint at Villa Park for a club to take a chance on him - Barcelona have been heavily linked - this summer.",
      "Rashford's sale will be considered as pure profit in the books. His departure will be key for the transfer budget, although shifting Antony and Jadon Sancho is also high on the agenda.",
      "Sancho will not be joining Chelsea on a permanent transfer, which means the Blues will now pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break the agreement they signed last summer.",
      "It's unprecedented for a club to pay £5m to break their obligation agreement and the ordeal is embarrassing for Sancho, whose career has sadly nosedived over the last few years.",
      "It also means a new buyer must come to the table for Sancho. There have been murmurs of interest from Turkey and United will hope they can bank £20m minimum for the winger.",
      "Antony could be remembered as the worst Premier League signing ever, but he was tremendous during his Real Betis loan and the Spanish club would like to sign him permanently.",
      "The Brazilian must be sold for £32.5m to avoid a PSR loss on his transfer from Ajax, but that would make him Real Betis' record transfer and they probably don't have that capital to spend.",
      "Again, that means United need to find a new willing buyer for Antony this summer, but his stock has improved due to his hugely successful loan stint and £32.5m feels like a fair valuation.",
      "The fourth sale up Amorim's sleeve is Alejandro Garnacho, who was informed he could find a new club this summer after a private breakdown with United's coach at the end of the campaign.",
      "Napoli and Chelsea were interested in signing Garnacho in the January transfer window. The fee of £40m was talked up, but United should be holding out for at least £50m for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho has proven himself in the Premier League, he is an Argentine international and has not reached his ceiling. He is worth £50m because of the untapped potential he possesses.",
      "Amorim was asked if Garnacho had played his final game for the club after the win over Aston Villa and said: \"Garnacho is one more player of Manchester United, so I don't know what is going to happen in the future. He is a normal player.\"",
      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Amorim has handled Garnacho intelligently in public to protect his transfer value, giving him minutes on the post-season tour, but the 20-year-old is expected to have played his final game for the club. The combined sales of that quartet would total 142.5m."

      "Not turning 18 until November, the Dane is playing in the Maurice Revello Tournament ahead of schedule.",
      "However, his return of two goals and one assist in his first three appearances in the competition highlights he is not struggling up against more senior figures.",

      "Whereas his goal against Japan was as a result of putting pressure on the goalkeeper and forcing him into a mistake, his strike against Congo was a low drive from outside the penalty area that crept into the bottom corner.",

      "In total, the forward scored 121 goals in 275 appearances for the Reds before leaving to join Blackburn Rovers in 2002. Cole retired from the professional game in November 2008 after a stint at Nottingham Forest and has gone on to work as a coach and pundit.",
      "The 53-year-old has also endured health problems since hanging up his boots, and in 2015, he suffered kidney failure. In 2017, he underwent a kidney transplant.",
      "And Cole has shared an update on Wednesday about his health to his Instagram followers, with several emotional posts.",
      "\"Process.. the journey continues,\" he said in the first post alongside a picture of the hospital ward he attended. \"Tired body in pain... we continue to understand kidney disease is draining at times... but we keep smiling as it's part of the process.\"",
      "In the second post, he shared a picture of his medication and said: \" Keep me going for the next 3 months quitting never an option with the good days we work with the bad days.\"",
      "Back in 2018, Cole shared the personal story of how he owes his sister’s son a ‘lifelong debt’ after a terrifying brush with death. The former footballer had struggled with illness for two years before his nephew, Alexander Palmer, was found to be the perfect match for a transplant in 2017.",
      "During the emotional interview, Andy said: “My family all rallied round to offer to be donors, my sisters and nephews, and that meant I had a donor quickly.",
      "“Alexander said to me: ‘Uncle I will do it. I cannot see you in this pain any more.’ I knew it is not going to be easy. He was 27 at the time, young, fit, the perfect match. But it was still a dilemma. I was thinking ‘what if it does not work, I have put him through all this pain, and he has risked all this for me?’",
      "“Thankfully, it was a very good match, and he made a full recovery. But I know that others in need are not so lucky, and wait years for a donor.”"

      "The start of Manchester United's pre-season campaign will be here before we know it.",
      "United are scheduled to play the opening game of their pre-season programme on Saturday, July 19, facing Leeds United in Stockholm. They will then travel to the United States for their pre-season tour a few days later.",
      "United will play three games in the US, facing West Ham United, Everton and Bournemouth as part of the Premier League Summer Series. After returning to home soil, they will wrap up their pre-season schedule with a clash against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "This will mark the third summer in a row that United have jetted off to the US for their pre-season tour. On the previous two, with the exception of just one game, United have been starved of an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in August 2023 after United had returned from the US and he got injured in the opening game of last summer's pre-season tour, meaning he has not had a full pre-season since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He will desperately be hoping it is third time lucky for him this summer, although Inter Milan's interest in his signature could see him shipped out of Old Trafford before United board their flight to the US in the fourth week of July.",
      "With United prepared to sell any player this summer, they are unlikely to stand in the 22-year-old's way if an enticing offer is presented to them. He scored just ten goals in 2024/25 and patience with him is wearing increasingly thin.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, it is no secret by now that United are desperate to sign a striker. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction that search will head in.",
      "They continue to be linked with the likes of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli, with both seemingly destined to move this summer, but no formal offers for a striker have yet been tabled by the Reds, with their focus currently on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United have already strengthened their attack by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, and Mbeumo is likely to command a similar fee, but ending the summer without recruiting an out-and-out No.9 can't be an option.",
      "The transfer window will temporarily close at 7pm this evening (Tuesday), but will reopen again as soon as next Monday.",
      "Once the window reopens, United need to try and step up their efforts in the seller's market. They want exits to reach double figures this summer and they have a crop of players within their ranks they want to sell who could bring in useful fees.",
      "United have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales, while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave. Selling any player is an easier-said-than-done task, of course, but if United were to successfully offload the aforementioned quartet, they would be looking to bank over £100m.",
      "That would give them a huge boost in their quest to sign a striker. Gyokeres is set to cost north of £60m and he is currently looking as though he could be the most likely candidate to strengthen Ruben Amorim's front line.",
      "Whether it be Gyokeres or an alternative centre-forward, it would be ideal if United could get a deal wrapped up in time to take their new chief goalscorer on the pre-season tour. That adaptation period can be so crucial for players ahead of the competitive action kicking off in August.",
      "Getting a new striker in ahead of the season starting would give Amorim the opportunity to see how he bonds and forms on-field relationships with his new teammates. United were playing catch-up in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee did not go on last summer's pre-season tour after being granted a period of leave following his participation at Euro 2024 with the Netherlands.",
      "With the Club World Cup taking place over the coming weeks, the summer break is bound to feel as though it is going that little bit quicker. It means the clock is ticking for United to secure their most important jigsaw piece."

      "In his first and only season at the Italian club, the Dane scored ten goals in 34 appearances across all competitions. It was a respectable return, but it was by no means eye-catching.",
      "However, United made the decision to pay £64million for his signature. The package could still rise to £72m.",
      "United, who had been interested in Harry Kane earlier in the window, were in desperate need of a striker and their search eventually led them to Hojlund. However, they bought potential rather than a finished product.",
      "He arrived at Old Trafford as an incredibly raw 20-year-old who suddenly had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He had been brought in to strengthen an attack that had been too reliant on Marcus Rashford in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "In truth, the jump from being a starting striker at Atalanta to being a starting striker at United was just too big for the Dane at such a young age. With the exception of the injury-prone Anthony Martial, Hojlund did not have anyone he could lean on for guidance or support.",
      "Despite that, he plundered a respectable 16 goals in his maiden season in England, and there was hope he would build on that tally in 2024/25. However, his performances regressed and he scored just ten goals, of which only four were netted in the Premier League.",
      "It further highlighted the feeling that Hojlund should have been signed to perform the role of United's secondary striker. Martial's injury record meant the Denmark international immediately had to step up and shoulder United's goalscoring burden.",

United are prepared to sell any player this summer and the striker is one of the more likely candidates to be moved on to raise funds for new additions.",

      "It is a striker of that ilk that United need to be signing this summer, as opposed to another striker in the bracket of Hojlund, who was recruited based on potential.",
      "Keane was right that Hojlund should have been signed to provide competition and not be the frontman of United's attack. This summer it feels almost inevitable that United will go down the right route when trying to bring in a No.9."

      "Manchester United are not expected to make any progress in Bryan Mbeumo talks by the first summer transfer deadline.",
      "United submitted an opening offer of £45million with a further £10million in add-ons for Mbeumo, but it fell short of Brentford’s valuation and talks are continuing between the clubs.",
      "There is no update on Mbeumo expected by the first summer transfer deadline. The summer transfer window opened on June 1 and will close again Tuesday, June 10.",
      "The transfer window will reopen on Monday, June 16, and remain open until the newly announced deadline day time of 7pm on Monday, September 1.",
      "United would like to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo as soon as possible so he can report for the start of pre-season at Carrington in July.",
      "Mbeumo contributed 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last season, predominantly playing on the right wing but also making a handful of appearances down the middle.",
      "United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle have been linked with a deal for Mbeumo this summer, but the player has indicated that he would prefer a move to Manchester.",
      "Tottenham are closing in on the appointment of Thomas Frank, who has overseen Mbeumo's development at Brentford, but the player is understood to be keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Mbeumo is about to enter the final year of his Brentford contract, although the London club have the option of triggering a one-year extension in his deal.",
      "United are targeting at least three priority signings, with the £62.5m signing of Matheus Cunha already confirmed."

      "Man Utd have submitted an offer to sign Viktor Gyokeres as they look to beat Arsenal in the race for the Sporting CP striker, according to reports.",
      "It was understood that the Red Devils would be unlikely to compete with other clubs for Gyokeres this summer after failing to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "However, journalist Ben Jacobs claimed recently that the Sweden international would actually be ‘very keen’ on joining Man Utd without European football next season.",
      "That led to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano giving an update on Tuesday, in which he claimed that Man Utd had made “new contacts” over a possible deal for Gyokeres with the Red Devils “still interested”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "READ: Spend now, sell later? Man Utd could be stuck with bloated bomb squad",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",
      "However, Portuguese journalist Nuno Farinha said on Wednesday that Arsenal are the club Gyokeres “has wanted from the very beginning” and the Gunners are “very advanced” on the transfer.",
      "Farinha revealed on CNN Portugal: “The talks with Arsenal are not new but they have now become more formal since the Gyökeres situation became the situation it was.",
      "“The meeting is currently taking place. Gyökeres’ agent is currently meeting with the owners of Arsenal to try to speed up this process. I don’t know exactly what the amounts are or what amounts are on the table.",
      "“Arsenal is the club that Gyökeres has wanted from the very beginning. Gyökeres wants to play for Arsenal, that’s his desire. He was very open about it to his agent.",
      "“No formal proposal has arrived at Sporting. This time it seems that there will be, because things with Arsenal are already very advanced and it seems to me that there is a great desire to speed up this process. That is why a meeting is taking place at this moment.",
      "“I believe it is in London, which is why I mentioned the issue of British punctuality. Basically, what is important from now on is to understand how this meeting went and how Arsenal will prepare for what we already know is Sporting’s position. €60m plus €10m is out of the question.”",
      "But Portuguese newspaper A Bola claim that Man Utd ‘have not given up’ in the race to sign Gyokeres as Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim is now ‘taking on a very important role’.",
      "And Spanish website Fichajes insist that the Red Devils ‘have decided to take the final step and submit [an] offer’ for Gyokeres after Sporting CP’s ‘stance on his asking price has sparked anger among the striker, who had expected a very different scenario this summer’.",
      "Arsenal have two irons in the fire with the Sweden international and RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, while Man Utd ‘have redoubled their interest in Gyokeres’.",
      "And Romano described Gyokeres as ‘furious’ on Wednesday evening after the Sporting president admitted he wouldn’t be sold for €65m this summer.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Tense situation between Viktor Gyökeres and Sporting. Despite previous pact for exit worth fee around €65m w/add-ons, Sporting president insists on higher fee. Price still under €100m clause but not €65m now. Gyökeres, described as furious.’",
      "Arsenal are in “very advanced” negotiations with Viktor Gyokeres’ representatives as they look to beat Manchester United in the race to sign the striker.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United target Viktor Gyokeres has decided to ‘go on strike’ as he looks to secure a big move elsewhere this summer.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists that Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres is not “the guy” to score goals for the Red Devils next season.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly joined a pair of rival sides in pursuit of an expensive striker, but they “would like” to sign a cheaper option if possible.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is ‘worried’ by Arsenal interest in Viktor Gyokeres as RB Leipzig continue to make a deal difficult, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are at risk of being hijacked in the race to sign Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres after a ‘direct call’."

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Florian Asprilla or Faustino Wirtz?\nHi guys",
      "I think Niall makes some valid points. The only caveat I have is that Arne just won the league with a squad 99% created by Jurgen Klopp. I’m therefore confident that he’ll get it right with the players he wants to add to the squad.",
      "That said, the injury to Bajetic, who I thought might be Gravenberch’s understudy this season, highlights what Niall is saying that we should perhaps be prioritising other positions. If Grav is injured, does that mean our midfield is Mac, Szobo and Wirtz? And do we then bench Frimpong, and play Bradley as the much more defensive right back?",
      "If Kevin Keegan was our manager, I’d be emailing calling the Wirtz deal our Faustino Asprilla moment. As it is, in Arne we trust (but if he changes his mind, we trust then also).\nMichael, LFC, in Hackney",
      "",
      "There was an interesting take from Niall about whether we should be splashing out on Wirtz. Then noticed Football365 already (jokingly?) heating up the Wirtz Vs Cherki debate before its even started with the 10 transfers article.",
      "All this during times when one the one hand its very exciting to be linked with a mega-money signing but there is also the worry about what happens if it all falls through…the worst possible thing… being mocked by rival fans.",
      "I remember well the mocking and jeers at Caicedo chose Chelsea over us.  At the time it was a bit depressing. Going to be honest not that sad about it now though.",
      "I was kind of with Niall that maybe its too much and we shouldn’t be offering so much for one player, but then remembered that was exactly how I felt about Van Dijk, He was too expensive and we had embarrassed ourselves. That worked out pretty well. So I reckon we trust the Liverpool system now and realise they probably know what they are doing. They definitely know more than me about what is worth spending the money on.",
      "Anyway making a team of Dan’s was way trickier than I thought it would be. I realised that Dani Pacheco is 34 now and his breakthrough season is coming.",
      "GK Danny Ward\nRB Danny Alves\nCB Dan Burn\nCB Danilo Luiz da Silva\nLB Danny Rose",

      "Some Subs: Daniel Agger, Dani Carvajal, Danilo(Other one), Danny Mills, Dani Ceballos, Danny Ings, Danny Welbeck\nDan T",
      "",
      "Interesting to see Niall, Annapolis’ take on Liverpool’s move for Florian Wirtz this morning. I’m a United fan so I always have to parse my views on the Scousers’ business and avoid the “hope this goes to shit” lens that can distort my takes.",
      "But even when (I think) I manage to do that, I don’t see this as anything other than an odd departure from Liverpool’s normal modus operandi. The Frimpong and Kerkez deals make perfect sense – signing sorted early in the window, decent value obtained, lots of potential upside and limited exposure.",
      "But paying over £110m for one player, who maybe needs to be accommodated in a number 10 role which hasn’t been an orthodox part of Liverpool’s system for the past decade, looks laden with risk. Maybe this is the beginning of Slot shifting from Klopp’s system having had the good sense to not tear everything up when he first arrived. Maybe the balance between midfield and attack can be tweaked and refined. I wouldn’t assume to know the nuances of top level football well enough to categorically state one or the other.",
      "But in the interests of speculating, it does feel a bit Veron-to-United, or maybe Asprilla-to-Newcastle. A high profile, high quality player being added while in a position of strength, but maybe an unnecessary move that creates a selection issue rather than complementing the existing squad.",
      "To my eyes, that money would be better spent on a striker who gets closer to Firmino’s old levels than Nunez has since he joined.",
      "I could obviously be proven spectacularly wrong. Wirtz might be the centrepiece of a grand plan and maybe they build successfully around him. But as a fan of what should be a rival club, I’m okay-ish with Liverpool planning to spend such a high % of their transfer funds on him. To put it in terms that fans of the other big teams might relate to: I’d feel infinitely more concerned if they were dangling that £110m+ in front of Newcastle and going heavy to get Isak.\nKeith Reilly",
      "",
      "Am I missing something?\nAt the bottom of many of the pages I read on this very fine website a poll is running, ‘Who will win the 2025/26 Premier League title?’ and the current results are shocking, they may have changed but at the time of writing it is as below:",

      "I’m just going to rank these in the order I think the top 4 teams will actually finish next season:",
      "1st. Man City – 14% – Huh?",
      "How has Man City fallen this far in the eyes of the “informed” football public? This is a team that has won 6 out of the last 8 seasons, a team that has beaten record after record consistently since Pep took over, a team that had a manager who had quite a few personal problems to deal with this season and still finish 3rd after a meltdown and missing their best player, the lynch pin of the squad, being out for most of the season.",
      "They started rebuilding in January and have just added more quality players, a lot of people forget how this team was built, to solve problems this City team just spends £50 million on a player, if it doesn’t work out, they buy another £50 million player in the same position, rinse and repeat, look at the saga of left back till Kyle Walker signed. They have been keeping their hand in their pocket for the last couple of seasons (probably due to a 115 reasons) but don’t get this team wrong, they are willing to spend and spend big to get back on their perch.",
      "FFP means nothing to them until a punishment is given and by cementing themselves as too big to fail, the FA are more than likely to just roll over, charge them £100 million and dock them 40 points, they finish 8th – 6th on 60 points that season and then go back to winning ways getting another 3 titles until Pep buggers off and then the clone of Alex Ferguson takes over just to take the piss.",
      "How quick people forget, barring Rodri suffering from PTSD due to his injury, this team will win the title next season, just look at the team. Erling will put his other scoring boots on and get the golden boot by December (its weird that a striker who got 31 goals in 44 appearances is seen as a poor season but he is that good), Rodri is one of only 2 defensive players to win the Ballon d’Or in recent memory (last 20 years), Phil Foden is still quite talented, Cherki and Reijnders are coming, they have a shed load of underage talent (not in the Epstein way) and Ederson is Ederson and always will be Ederson. They’ve even got Oscar Bobb, who you’ve never heard of but he has one premier league medal more than you.",
      "This is Man Cities title to lose, the also rans will just have to wait till Pep goes through another divorce or for FFP to give a points deduction, which ever comes first.",
      "2nd. Liverpool – 45% – Wait, what?",
      "At the start of this season Liverpool people thought we were lucky to make it into the top four, let alone win the thing with 4 games to go. I think Liverpool were criminally underrated due to the unknown of Arnie Slot, the season before they had been trying to get the quady for Klopp and were very close (they still had a chance until the 17/03), the change of manager was the only major thing and for the first half of this season no team could touch them, Liverpool went from a team that was on default tactics on Pro Evo to the dick who spends 40 minutes setting up their team while everyone else sits around getting drunk.",
      "They were more fun under Klopp but they are now scarier, Klopps team were headstrong running though walls, if the wall didn’t go down they would still run until they knocked themselves out, Slots team has learnt to move around the wall, apart from the PSG match which they lost but were incredible in, this team always looked like it could go to another level in a match but usually won without having to do it.",
      "The transfers of Frimpong, Kerkez and Wirtz are statement signings, showing intent to be the next era of football, beating all in their path, sadly, like Klopps team when we bought Allison and Van Dyke, they are coming up against a juggernaut called Man City. A striker will help and Liverpool will push City all the way to the end but they will not beat them, this season wasn’t the start of Man Cities downfall, it was just a blip that happened under extraordinary bad luck, luck they have paid a lot of money to change.",
      "I understand recency bias but nearly half the people who visit this website think Liverpool will win next season, I find that insane, we might be making the right noises but you can’t forget the past, it always bloody repeats itself.",
      "3rd. Arsenal – 21% – Ha!",
      "I don’t want to troll Arsenal fans, some of my best friends are Arsenal fans but 21% HA. This team is youngish, has unbelievable talent and can beat anyone on their day, they have an attack that a Saudi team would pay a billion for and a defence that would get £750 million, they have a lot more strength than a “usual” Arsenal team and have the options to bully or out pass a lot of teams, on football manager this is the team you would want as it’d take a few shrewd signings and some really good half time team talks to be a treble winner.",
      "The problem I’ve found with this Arsenal team is the sense of entitlement, the manager and a vocal minority of the fan base, seem to have, they both have an excuse for every situation and seem to think that they deserve to win it just because they played well for 3 seasons. “If it wasn’t for a red card”, “If we hadn’t had injuries”, “If the wind had blown in a different direction”, “if the season had started at christmas…”, its just excuse after excuse.",
      "When Liverpool were always the bridesmaid they didn’t complain anywhere near the amount as some of these youtube, voice of the fan, cockgobblers and Klopp didn’t whine as much as Arteta does, he’s a sexy man with a sexy wife with a sexy life, why does he always look like someone has pissed on his chips. (Might try and turn that last line into a song)",
      "This unearned arrogance seems to have seeped into the mentality of the team, the strops the players have from time to time are apparent, a card goes against them, a VAR decision is DEFINITELY wrong or a tackle was a bit hard and they down tools, wanting to take the ball home because the beautiful game has been marred because its not the Arsenal way.",
      "If this team got a new manager (hopefully Arteta just moves on when they come third next season so the board don’t look like bad guys when they fire him) they could go from strength to strength, if he hadn’t of managed Tottenham Ange would of been great as long as he wasn’t allowed near the tactics, his infectious personality and will to win while also admitting when they are shit was a breath of fresh air and if it had been at Arsenal you could see a completely different player mentality.",
      "Another reason for my reaction is that they haven’t won anything, don’t bring up that bloody FA Cup, they are always near but in the final part of a season/cup they just fall away because they thought they’d already won it, this season would of been hilarious if Man City had got up to second, another “How does Arsenal come 3rd in a 2 horse race?” would of turned them into the new Spurs and who wouldn’t want Arsenal to turn into the new Spurs.",
      "4th.  Aston Villa – 0% (or 11% with other) – Why not?",
      "Its not about Aston Villa being better, its about Aston Villa having less intense games to deal with, the Europa Cup, while fun, isn’t anywhere near as taxing as Champs League, Newcastle are still paper thin having a lot of the same back up players they had in the championship, Chelsea are still young and while they could become amazing, I can also see this becoming the norm around European match time, resting players for the wednesday, losing, playing on the wednesday, losing and then because the teams knackered they lose on the following Saturday, having 3 loses in a row which is a heavy hit to the mentality of a young team.",
      "Man United are still rebuilding from the last rebuild, Tottenham are Tottenham and will forever be Tottenham, Forest may make an upset but its a long season, they will more than likely do what they did this season and sadly fall away. Brighton could get in there, they have a great squad which is constantly being pillaged by the bigger boys, if they can keep them this season and not having any European football its on the card (what a weird sentence, Brighton being a top four team)",
      "Aston Villa has become a team to be reckoned with, we’ve seen what they can do with a competent manager and a team of battle hardened machines that know what they need to do, add a bit of flair into this team and this is a no brainer.",

      "I don’t have a dog in the fight over whether or not Ange should have been sacked, nor do I care a whit whether or not Spurs or Arsenal have had a more successful season, but I’m not sure that O Clark gets to use Spurs’ defensive injury crisis as an argument in defence of Postecoglu.",
      "There’s a fairly solid evidence base that he bears some culpability for the repeated and identical injuries that their defenders have suffered, not merely in terms of the high line system that they play, but also in terms of his somewhat antediluvian training methods.",
      "And that’s not even talking about how common it is for players to break down immediately on return from injury, which leads one to believe that he may be rushing them back too early from their rehabilitation.",

      "Look and Mourinho and Guardiola – they both took the league cup seriously (and won it the season they first won the league) because they wanted to instill a culture of winning trophies. Winning a cup (even a lesser one) is a big part of building a dominant team that is able to handle those biggest games.",
      "If Arteta had won a trophy this season people wouldn’t suddenly say he was doing a good job (he is already, let’s be honest), but as a Liverpool fan I’d be very nervous that this Arsenal team had managed to get over that hurdle. Until that point, there will always be a question over the team taking that final step.\nTom, Andover",

      "Ange was a good coach.",
      "Winning cup trophies is not equal to league success or exhibit superiority over better teams that would usually  beat cup winners in the league(see crystal palace vs city, arsenal vs city in the FA cup), however it does show the ability of the inferior team to beat opposition despite the clear disparity in terms of football skills  and the potential to improve-building from their win.",
      "Cup wins signify success. Tottenham won the Europa cup. Spurs were successful.",
      "Football shall not remember arsenal finishing 2nd for the 3rd time rather it will tell the tale of the Australian guy who won that European cup and the victory by spurs over a supposedly bigger opponent. Cup wins are indeed a measure of a teams’ success even while experiencing failure at the league level.",
      "Ange was a realist. He accepted the situation he was in, where the odds were stacked against him-the players ability (Son was the only world class talent), consistency, cohesion and motivation to win games,support from management was highly depleted-eventually leading him to the transparent conclusion that a league triumph was impossible but the euro cup was achievable. This gamble was made despite the consequences of league defeats to inferior opposition while playing with an (apparently) uninspiring style of football but the cup win was worth it(you could see the happiness of spurs fans despite enduring a bad league season and the subsequent drama in football it brought, like arsenal assuming the mantle of the ‘spursy’ team of the season).",

      "“It is simple. To do something, we need to sell players.”",
      "Ruben Amorim there, acknowledging publicly in February what he must have been saying behind closed doors for three months prior to that. Since then, his resolve to make major changes at Old Trafford can only have strengthened in the wake of United’s worst season in living memory, their wretched failures making it more imperative that the Red Devils finally learn how to sell.",
      "Amorim has commenced his rebuild, paying £62million to get Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Man Utd will probably spend a similar sum on Bryan Mbeumo. Given the chance, Amorim might drop the same again on Viktor Gyokeres. All of which will make Man Utd a lot more fun to watch. But vibes won’t pay their bills.",
      "The club’s financial situation is perhaps not as perilous as Sir Jim Ratcliffe might want us to believe while Man Utd go through another round of layoffs. It was thought that Amorim might have just shy of £100million to spend in the summer market before he had to raise funds through sales. Any two of the three aforementioned forwards would take Man Utd well over that budget.",
      "So it’s time to sell, sell, sell. Something they are notoriously bad at. And the early signs suggest they are yet to catch on.",
      "The Telegraph gave an insight into United’s sales strategy only last month. Apparently, the Red Devils believed they could rake in £90million by selling Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony.",
      "At best, that was wishful thinking. At worst, another sign of the delusion and incompetence that has made Man Utd one of the biggest patsies in the European game.",
      "United’s best hope with Sancho was they were dealing with Chelsea. If the Blues won’t do that deal, who will? Who is going to pay serious money for a barely-arsed big name, one with another year left on a massive contract who everyone knows Man Utd want shot of?",
      "It is a similar story with Rashford. An unwanted, disinterested player on a huge salary. Any club tempted to give the England forward a fresh start would be daft to offer Man Utd anything more than the loan-first deal Villa initially agreed to then refused to follow through on.",
      "Antony might be a more straightforward sale. Yes, at a price to shame United’s recruiters again but and even while offering a £60million hit, there is hardly a clamour, despite the Brazilian showing some signs of life at Real Betis.",
      "Rather than bank £90million to put towards a rebuild, more likely is that two, maybe all three, will once more be loaned out, only after they have sulked around Carrington for some or much of pre-season, before Man Utd accept liability for significant portions of their salary.",
      "That reality appears to have dawned on Man Utd if there’s any truth in the report that they have sought to fill some of that black hole by increasing their asking price for one of their more sellable assets.",
      "However, we can only assume whomever forecasted a £90million deposit for their loan exiles also priced Alejandro Garnacho at £70million. Because that’s an equally nonsensical figure.",
      "Garnacho is no more wanted than Sancho, Rashford, Antony. Less so, perhaps, given Amorim is more familiar with his flaws than the others’. And any club who might take a chance on the Argentina international knows it.",
      "“You better pray that you can find a club to sign you,” Garnacho was told by Amorim during the Bilbao inquest. And, sure, it will serve the player to be elsewhere next season. But Man Utd ought to be the party dropping to their knees. Without divine intervention, they have no hope of raking in £70million for the maddeningly-inconsistent winger.",
      "Chelsea and Arsenal have both been linked with Garnacho, but both have cheaper, arguably better alternatives. Napoli, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all interested, are they? Not at that price, not while United’s desire to be rid of Garnacho is so well documented.",
      "To furnish Amorim with the bare minimum he needs to jumpstart the Man Utd juggernaut on the road to credibility, the Red Devils must at least double the £100million they started with. Selling the four-man bomb squad is unlikely to achieve that, let alone rake in the £160million they anticipated.",
      "Who else could Man Utd take to market? Bruno Fernandes scuppered whatever plans the club may have had to cash in on their captain. Many Man Utd fans, including Gary Neville, would be loathe to see Kobbie Mainoo sold to the highest bidder but the homegrown midfielder is one of few others over whom Man Utd could negotiate from a position of authority.",
      "For the vast majority of Amorim’s squad, certainly those he wants rid of, it is a buyer’s market. And before long, a borrower’s one.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Chelsea\nYou could substitute Chelsea for Liverpool at any point here while discussing the rumours around Ekitike. Both clubs are interested but each have the same problem: Eintracht Frankfurt and their insistence on £85million.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea are being weird here. They wanted Maignan in for the Club World Cup but refused to pay more than £10-12million, only just over half the price Milan want to sell the France no.1. Now the Blues can’t take him to USA, they don’t want him at all. That makes such little sense that it probably isn’t as dead as Chelsea want us to believe.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Manchester United\nOsimhen apparently fancies a move to Old Trafford, presumably because he’s seen the salaries United have been dishing out in recent years. Napoli want around £70million, though they may take Joshua Zirkzee in part-exchange. This one doesn’t pass the sniff test, unless we get to late in the window with all parties in the same position they are now.",
      "",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Bayer Leverkusen\nThere was talk of interest from Newcastle, which was a move we could really get on board with. But a loan with a £67milion obligation always seemed a little fanciful on City’s part. A £40million deal to replace Florian Wirtz at Leverkusen seems more like the kind of fee City would take for a player with no future under Guardiola, but we’d still rather Grealish stuck around in the Premier League.",

      "14) 🔼 Heung-min Son – Tottenham Hotspur to Al-Hilal\nThe Saudi Arabian club are desperate to make a statement signing and the Spurs captain could be perfect. He’s out of contract next summer, and Son admitted on Tuesday that his future is far from certain.",
      "",
      "13) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. Which doesn’t seem likely any time soon.",
      "",
      "12) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Fine, but he won’t get that at Newcastle while Alexander Isak is around. For how long will that be? That is the more pressing concern for Newcastle fans.",
      "11) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered. So Pope might be happy to hear that the two clubs are some way off an agreement with Burnley said to be asking for £40million.",
      "",
      "10) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Tottenham Hotspur\nThe Cherries reportedly want £70m, which feels unrealistic. A transfer still feels inevitable and Man United, Liverpool and Spurs have all been linked and Londoners are the favourites.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Wilfried Ndidi – Leicester to Manchester United\nThe Nigeria midfielder has a £9million release clause and United see him as a good value squad addition to bolster their midfield options, especially if they sell Casemiro this summer. Which makes sense. Everton and the Saudis are also sniffing.",
      "8) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker had overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack after much deliberation on the Gunners’ part. But perhaps they hadn’t accounted for how much of a slog it would be to negotiate with RB Leipzig, who are refusing to accept anything under their £70million valuation. As is their right. Especially when Al-Hilal seem keen to cough up if Sesko can be convinced to move to Saudi.",
      "",
      "7) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Sporting say they haven’t received any offers and they also insist that reports of a gentleman’s agreement for him to leave for £59million are b*llocks. Which Gyokeres disputes. This could get messy.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTottenham’s renewed interest threatened to scupper United’s hopes of landing Mbeumo but even the prospect of following Thomas Frank to Spurs isn’t deterring the forward from pursuing a move to Old Trafford. He’ll get his way ‘soon’, apparently.",
      "",
      "5) Kepa Arrizabalaga – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one is moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million. Interesting one, this. Kepa recovered some credibility on loan at Bournemouth last season and won’t be going to Arsenal just to play second fiddle to David Raya. Bring on the Gunners goalie wars!",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein says it’s done.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Kevin De Bruyne – Manchester City to Napoli\nThere was a hitch around image rights but that has been resolved and De Bruyne is due in Rome on Thursday to undergo and medical and sign a two-year contract to fulfil his dream of playing with Scott McTominay.",

      "United could allow a number of their first-team players to leave this summer. A number of attacking players have been linked with the exit.",
      "Last season’s loan departures Marcus Rashford and Antony are both likely to leave – the former permanently and the latter potentially on another loan.",
      "Fellow forwards Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho are also each being linked with exits.",

      "What calculations have gone into that percentage are unclear. But it is evident that Garnacho would like to head to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It was reported at the beginning of June that the winger had told his agent to make it clear that he wanted to play for Chelsea next.",
      "There will seemingly be chances for him to move out of England too, though.",

      "Beya declared: “Gyokeres, you’ve got to go for him.” To which Lescott swiftly said: “I believe that you’re going to go for him – but he’s not the guy.”",
      "Ferdinand replied: “I don’t think he’s the guy. I’ve not watched him loads [but] I’ve watched him probably three times really, really closely.",

      "“Is there enough – after he’s physically matched – to get him a goal?”",
      "Lescott added: “You don’t get away with that in the Prem.”",
      "A report on Tuesday in Portugal insisted that Gyokeres is ‘furious’ after Sporting apparently broke a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to sell him for €70m (£59m) in the summer.",
      "It had reportedly been ‘agreed’ that his €100m would ‘not be an obstacle’ for a summer transfer and that Gyokeres ‘could leave if Sporting received a concrete offer of €60 million, plus €10 million depending on objectives’.",
      "But Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas has rejected those claims and insisted that Gyokeres “will not leave” for €70m this summer.",
      "Varandas said: “I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that. To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres – neither today nor last season.”",
      "The Sporting president added: “One of the agent’s biggest concerns was whether we would demand the termination clause.",
      "“He wanted to guarantee certain things. And what was agreed? That Sporting would not demand a release clause now.",
      "“For one reason: he was going to be 27 years old and no player leaves Portugal at 27 for 100m eurors or 90m euros.",
      "“In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: ‘It’s not worth us setting a value because I don’t know what will happen in a year’s time.

      "And now The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has an update on the Red Devils’ interest in Mbeumo as he insists a deal “will get done” despite reports of a potential Tottenham hijack.",
      "Whitwell told Stretford Paddock’s YouTube channel: “The first bid was £45m, plus £10m in add-ons… but I think Brentford want a fee more in line with what United paid for Cunha. They’ve looked at it and thought, this is what you’re paying for Cunha, Mbeumo also scores goals, so…",

      "“So now we’re at a point where the clubs are deciding how much that is going to be. I think all the sides think that this will get done, but I don’t think it is imminent.",
      "“I don’t believe anything is going to happen today (Tuesday, before the mini summer deadline), but my personal view is that it will get done eventually.”",
      "When asked if there is anything incoming Tottenham boss Thomas Frank could do to turn Mbeumo’s head at this stage, Whitwell replied: “No, I don’t think so.",
      "“I’m sure the player will have known the likelihood of what that was (Frank leaving for Spurs), but that was trailed as something for quite a while and if the player really felt he wanted it, he could have gone there.”",

      "“The stature of the place – and I know people have been upset about him choosing Man Utd when there is no European football on offer.",

      "Former CBS Sports journalist Ben Jacobs echoed a lot of what Whitwell had said when asked about a potential Tottenham hijack of the deal.",
      "Jacobs said on The United Stand: “Regarding the Spurs part in all of this. You can never say definitively that Thomas Frank won’t influence Tottenham’s transfer business.",
      "“My understanding is very clear as of now, Tottenham know Mbeumo’s preference is Manchester United, as do all other suitors.",
      "“Just because a new manager comes in, especially under Daniel Levy, it’s very unlikely they’ll turn around to Thomas Frank and say ‘is getting Mbeumo a deal breaker and can you hijack Manchester United’s plans.’",
      "“I’m not expecting Thomas Frank’s expected arrival at Tottenham to hugely influence the Mbeumo situation, the most important thing is that Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United and if the clubs agree the fee, regardless of the Tottenham situation, Mbeumo will still pick Manchester United.”",

      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes urged the Red Devils to sign Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze during England’s 3-1 defeat to Senegal on Tuesday night.",
      "Eze played the full 90 minutes against Senegal as Thomas Tuchel suffered his first defeat as England manager as the Three Lions were booed off following an underwhelming performance.",
      "Crystal Palace winger Eze had only been brought off the bench in the second half of their 1-0 win over Andorra in England’s World Cup qualifier on Saturday – but Tuchel trusted him to make an impact from the start against Senegal.",
      "Man Utd are looking to add attacking talent to their ranks this summer with a deal for Matheus Cunha already sealed in a £62.5m deal from Wolves.",
      "The Red Devils have also made a couple of bids for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo with the Bees using the fee Man Utd paid for Cunha as a guide to how much they want for the Cameroon international.",
      "And Scholes has urged Man Utd to sign Eze – who could be available for £68m – after the Crystal Palace star was one of the only bright sparks for Tuchel’s side on a miserable evening on Tuesday.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Wirtz to Liverpool for record fee as Chelsea fail to sign Gittens",

      "Former Man Utd striker Dwight Yorke also recently urged the Red Devils to sign Eze as it’s a “no-brainer”.",
      "Yorke said: “Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace would be perfect for Manchester United.",
      "“Yeah, he scored at the weekend in the FA Cup final, but it’s not just about that. A year ago, maybe more, I said this kid and Michael Olise – who went to Bayern – United should buy them for £100 million. Put £100m down and you will get two fantastic players.",
      "“Instead, they listened to the figures in the hierarchy, which is understandable, but it’s glaring just how good these two are.",
      "“Eze has the decision-making, the talent, he’s a good athlete, he can create and score. He’s at the right age to step up and play on a bigger platform. It’s a no-brainer.”",
      "And another former Man Utd player, Teddy Sheringham, reckons Eze “could walk into” the Red Devils side, as well as Arsenal’s if the Gunners were interested.",
      "Sheringham told Prime Casino: “I think he could walk into the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal’s first team, and he would be a brilliant option for other clubs. City have been linked with him, I can see him fitting into Pep’s style of play because he’s a very gifted footballer.",
      "“You know, they’re all wanting better players and he’s playing at the top of his game at the moment and looks fantastic. So, any one of those clubs would be wanting him. Manchester United could definitely do with someone like that.”",
      "Manchester United have reportedly looked at a pair of stars from the same club who could cost a combined £148million, and one of them will do anything he “possibly can ...",
      "Tottenham have reportedly made an offer for Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze after his heroics at Wembley over the weekend.",

      "Thomas Frank plans to mark his leap up the Premier League pecking order by making Bryan Mbeumo his first signing, copying an expensive move Man Utd ‘never wanted’.",
      "Frank is expected to be appointed Spurs manager shortly after the north London club struck up an agreement with Brentford to make the Dane one of the most expensive coaches in Premier League history.",
      "But the plundering of Brentford might not stop there as Frank has ‘demanded’ that Bryan Mbeumo accompany him on the trip to Spurs, who will have to hijack Man Utd’s move for the forward.",
      "It would not be the first time a manager has joined a bigger club and made sure one of his players joins him – although Spurs will hope it goes better than most of these examples.",
      "",
      "Marouane Fellaini\nDavid Moyes “never wanted Marouane Fellaini to be my first Man Utd signing”, but the subtext is hilarious and crucial.",
      "While he always intended to pack the Belgian among his belongings for the trip from Everton to Old Trafford, the manager was painfully aware of The Optics in using the rare transfer pull of one of the biggest clubs in world football to immediately bring in a relatively uncultured player from his old club.",
      "But Ed Woodward somehow contrived to deliver an even more embarrassing scenario in his first and worst transfer window at Man Utd. Fellaini was the only signing handed down to Moyes after futile pursuits of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Thiago Alcantara, Cesc Fabregas, Ander Herrera and Fabio Coentrao, among a great many others.",
      "“I knew, coming from my old club, the look of him was never going to be [right for United],” Moyes added. It undeniably contributed to the sheer incompetence of Man Utd signing Fellaini for £27.5m on September 3, despite there being a release clause in his contract making him £4m cheaper up to July 31.",
      "Not that Moyes’ concern over perception prevented the club from making a joint bid for Fellaini and Leighton Baines earlier that summer.",
      "The tales of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic being shown tapes of Phil Jagielka are regrettably apocryphal but it is without doubt that a manager out of his depth clutched a comfort blanket that carried the scent of Goodison Park as his big career break ended in inevitable failure.",
      "Then again, as Sunderland manager a few years later Moyes openly said of Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj that he would “drive down to Manchester and pick them up” if a deal was possible, so the bloke obviously just values familiarity.",
      "",
      "Arouna Kone\nIt is remarkable that Moyes jumping up to Man Utd was not the most absurd case of overpromotion those circumstances produced. Rarely ever has a manager failed upwards quite so impressively as Roberto Martinez with Everton.",
      "The Spaniard arrived at Goodison Park as the Moyes replacement armed with an FA Cup winner’s medal, but the addition of a Premier League relegation on his CV suggested the arrangement might not end so well.",
      "A brilliant first season was the precursor to two years of expensive backwards steps, by which point Martinez was sacked and again ludicrously fell higher up the managerial ladder by being entrusted with the Golden Generations of both Belgium and Portugal.",
      "Martinez surely spent his first days in both posts investigating the genealogy of his old Wigan squad. His first signing at Everton was that of Kone, who described it as “an honour to be back working with the manager once again”.",
      "James McCarthy made the same jump soon afterwards, passing Fellaini in the Finch Farm reception on deadline day as Man Utd, Everton and Wigan crystallised their respective places in the football food chain to an unnecessary extent.",
      "",
      "Richarlison\nFrank will inherit a fractured Spurs dressing room in any case but the undying support of one player would have been guaranteed with a different intra-Premier League appointment.",
      "Richarlison specifically cited how he felt it was “important for me here to be with Marco Silva again” when Everton “spoiled” the entire transfer window by signing him in summer 2018.",
      "The pair had first crossed paths at Watford when Silva personally intervened to hijack the Brazilian’s planned move to Ajax. The Hornets sacked Silva five months later in a rare show of impatience with a manager, who landed at Everton by the summer.",
      "His first port of call was to link back up with Richarlison who, for his many faults, helped keep the Toffees up and never lacked for effort before leaving at a profit when Spurs came calling in summer 2022.",
      "",
      "Joe Allen\n“We have got some protection on Brendan coming back for our players in the initial period, which I think is the right thing,” Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said of a gentleman’s agreement – or what he termed “a 12-month respite” – designed to prevent Liverpool from raiding the Welsh club for anything more than their manager.",
      "It lasted all of 70 days. While Rodgers reunited with former Swansea loanee Fabio Borini in his first signing as head coach at Anfield, the Northern Irishman immediately went back on that handshake deal with his former employers to return for Allen.",
      "A furious Swansea lambasted Liverpool for reneging on “a written agreement” not to sign any of their players within a year of Rodgers’ appointment, but a clause which permitted Allen to join the Reds, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City or Man Utd for £15m overrode any informal accord.",
      "Swansea, realising Rodgers was likely willing to drag them through every court around the globe and fight to the death to sign a player so courageous, relented and decided to just win the League Cup with Ki Sung-yueng instead.",
      "",
      "Jermain Defoe\nIt is one of the great bits of Barclays folklore that the 18 most expensive signings in Harry Redknapp’s 34-year, almost 1,400-game managerial career only actually involve 15 players.",
      "Sandro ranks 18th and 12th. Peter Crouch is 8th and 5th. And Defoe comes 14th and 2nd. It is an unfathomably effective way of saying someone managed Spurs, Portsmouth and QPR without explicitly stating it.",
      "And the only thing preventing Niko Kranjcar from making that list is that he did not cost all that much on any of the three separate occasions Redknapp signed him.",
      "“This is the third club I have signed him for. I know what a top-class player he is,” Redknapp said after making Defoe his first signing as Spurs manager in January 2009, spending £15m on a player he bought for £9m as Portsmouth boss 12 months before, and West Ham poached for £1m or so before the turn of the millennium.",
      "That shared history spawned one of the great Redknapp stories – how he downplayed the need for Defoe to undergo a medical before completing the deadline day rule-breaking Portsmouth move “because he knew me from a kid and that” – but it was in north London where he laid the foundations for success on those diminutive but broad shoulders as his first purchase.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s new left-back won’t have too much difficulty in making more of a mark at Man Utd than the first signings of the post-Fergie managers.",
      "Nottingham Forest are throwing their weight around with plans for signings which were previously unrealistic. Either break transfer records or all the rules."

      "These players were all uncapped at the time of their signing; whether they went on to represent England is immaterial.",
      "",
      "20) Alex Scott (Bristol City to Bournemouth, £20m to £25m, August 2023)\nGary O’Neil must have been sick of the sight of Bournemouth in summer 2023, losing out on top Wolves target Scott to the team which traded him for Andoni Iraola months prior.",
      "Scott, then a teenager, eventually impressed after overcoming an injury which delayed his Bournemouth debut. On a different timeline he really might have made that England squad for Euro 2024 but his first U21 call only came that March as other cabs flew off the rank ahead of him.",
      "",
      "19) Tyrone Mings (Bournemouth to Aston Villa, £20m to £26.5m, July 2019)\nIt was A Big Thing when Aston Villa agreed to chuck £20m Bournemouth’s way in the process of making the loan of Mings a more permanent feature in 2019.",
      "The centre-half had played a key part in their rise from the Championship and as that year’s official Promoted Team That Makes A Load Of New Signings, it made perfect sense from Villa’s viewpoint if no-one else’s. An England squad place arrived a few months later and the Villa captaincy followed in 2021, much to Steven Gerrard’s future chagrin.",
      "",
      "18) Jobe Bellingham (Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund, £27.8m to £32m, June 2025)\nOther interested parties included Bundesliga rivals Leipzig and Frankfurt but it is a remarkably strong pitch to simply ask a player how their brother is doing. Dortmund primed Jude for superstardom and Jobe will be eyeing those footsteps like any other hand-me-down.",
      "",
      "17) Jude Bellingham (Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund, £22.5m to £30m, July 2020)\nManchester United pulled out all the stops and even wheeled in Sir Alex Ferguson but Borussia Dortmund’s pitch involved nonsense like clear pathways to the first team and boring Bellingham decided to make the best possible decision for his career instead of picking based on banter and vibes because he is boring.",
      "Within four months of his Germany move, Bellingham was firmly embedded in the England set-up, not to be moved for about two decades. He cannot have been far off doing a Jay Bothroyd and claiming a Three Lions caps while playing for a lower-division club.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Sheffield United to Arsenal, £24m to £30m, August 2021)\nRamsdale was as uncapped by the senior England side when he joined Arsenal as when he moved back to Sheffield United from Bournemouth the year before. The only difference this time was the ridicule he faced upon that switch to north London as a twice-relegated keeper signed as back-up for Bernd Leno.",
      "It took Ramsdale a couple of months to prove the doubters wrong and not much longer to force his way into the England picture. But both club and country moved on quickly to leave him stranded in the Championship.",
      "",
      "15) Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham to Tottenham, £25m to £30m, August 2019)\nIt is a dreadful shame that the 25-year-old Sessegnon remains uncapped. A total of 57 appearances in five seasons for Spurs leaves no mystery as to the problem for a talented player who has been derailed by injuries.",
      "The more comfortable climate of Fulham has inspired a career renaissance from a player happy to concentrate on finding his feet again at club level.",

      "14) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland to Everton, £25m to £30m, June 2017)\n“The club’s only going forward, so it’s the best thing I can be doing,” said Pickford upon his move from Sunderland to Everton, who had just finished 7th in the Premier League and have come 8th, 8th, 12th, 10th, 16th, 17th, 15th and 13th in the subsequent eight campaigns.",
      "His first England call-up came that August before his Three Lions debut in the November. No-one has been able to out-rave him between the sticks for his country in the meantime; Pickford is two clean sheets clear of Gordon Banks and just three behind David Seaman.",
      "",
      "13) Noni Madueke (PSV to Chelsea, £30m, January 2023)\nNever has a club spent more money in a January transfer window, but even at £30m Madueke was only their fourth most expensive signing in a hectic month.",
      "It has not been entirely plain sailing since but the 23-year-old is a Premier League hat-trick scorer with three assists in six England caps.",
      "",
      "12) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester to Chelsea, £30m, June 2024)\nIt was probably not part of the grand recruitment push to offer four times as many Conference League as Premier League minutes but that was the fate which befell Dewsbury-Hall when he accompanied Enzo Maresca to Chelsea.",
      "The Leicester Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season was lost in the shuffle in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and the only likely change will be fewer consolatory European opportunities for Dewsbury-Hall now Chelsea are back in the Champions League.",
      "",
      "11) Archie Gray (Leeds to Tottenham, £30m, July 2024)\nLeeds were ‘heartbroken’ to lose the boyhood brilliance of an academy product Brentford bid £35m for and, according to some outlets, Tottenham paid up to £40m to sign.",
      "Gray perhaps didn’t realise he was signing up for a ludicrously confusing season spent playing in about five different positions for a team which finished 17th and won the Europa League, but Ange Postecoglou knew he could lean on a teenager with 32 combined caps for England U15s, U16s, U17s, U19s, U20s and U21s.",
      "",
      "10) Liam Delap (Ipswich to Chelsea, £30m, June 2025)\nIpswich knew and readily embraced their role as the stepping stone for Delap, even if they might have envisaged a fine full debut Premier League season for the striker being enough to keep them up.",
      "The odds are that Delap would have jumped ship regardless with such a tempting release clause but a dozen goals in an unsuccessful fight against relegation confirmed it.",
      "The only variable was which club would be fortunate enough to inherit the Manchester City academy product; Chelsea will do their best to ruin the slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "9) Tino Livramento (Southampton to Newcastle, £32m, August 2023)\nSigned by Saints from Chelsea for just £5m in 2021, right-back Livramento earned Southampton a massive profit after just 34 appearances, his spell cruelly curtailed by injury.",
      "That likely contributed to his slow start at Newcastle, eventually turning out 35 times in his debut season and helping gradually wean Eddie Howe off his Kieran Trippier fix.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Brentford to Aston Villa, £28m to £33m, September 2020)\nOne season as a centre-forward was enough to tempt Aston Villa into parting with up to £33m for Watkins in September 2020. Those £5m in add-ons have surely been achieved across 87 goals, 18 England caps and Champions League qualification.",
      "",
      "7) Lewis Hall (Chelsea to Newcastle, £28m to £35m, July 2024)\nWith only 12 career appearances to his name by the time he joined Newcastle on loan, Hall was rather unsurprisingly not in the England picture.",
      "A first season with the Magpies in which he made his move permanent but still struggled for game time for the most part did little to improve those prospects.",
      "But the 20-year-old has his feet firmly under the St James’ Park table now as a fully-fledged England international.",
      "MORE TRANSFER COVERAGE FROM F3650\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Arsenal deal ‘done’, Chelsea’s nonsense stance\n👉 Premier League players who need a summer transfer for World Cup place: Grealish, Chiesa",
      "",
      "6) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "5) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "4) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "3) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "2) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "1) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’, but even when he does make that first international appearance, he will remain England’s most expensive uncapped player ever at least in spirit.",
      "Liverpool had have one Florian Wirtz bid rejected and may not find success with a second falling short of Leverkusen’s valuation. They have been here before.",
      "Cole Palmer was poor in an infuriatingly tepid England performance vs Andorra, while Noni Madueke was comfortably Thomas Tuchel’s best player…",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Noni Madueke and Robert Sanchez are on a list of 14 players put up for sale by Chelsea this summer, and Cole Palmer has been tipped for a shock exit.",
      "The imminent signing of Florian Wirtz at Liverpool “isn’t going to stop” the Reds from attempting to sign Anthony Gordon, according to reports.",
      "Cole Palmer has spoken of his excitement to play in Chelsea’s Europa Conference League final amid heading praise on Enzo Maresca."

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea. Spurs are also reportedly keen.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and Arsenal. Galatasaray and Fenerbahce have also reportedly offered the German big money. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund)\nA transfer to Chelsea looks extremely likely for the promising young winger, who scored 12 goals and provided five assists in 48 matches for Dortmund in 2024/25.",
      "The Blues want Gittens for the Club World Cup and are actively pursuing him, submitting a new €50m bid on Tuesday. If that fails, they won’t give up, and when the transfer window re-opens, they will surely land the 20-year-old – who has reportedly ‘ignored’ interest from Arsenal to pursue a move to west London.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked. Surprisingly, he wants to join the Red Devils over the other two clubs. Thomas Frank to Spurs could throw a spanner in the works, though…",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "His performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 10:08, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",

      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting; Sweden international is in-demand after a sensational spell in Portugal which has sent his value soaring; Gyokeres has also attracted interest from Premier League rivals Arsenal",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 15:13, UK",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",

      "Man Utd remain interested in new No 9 even if Bryan Mbeumo joins, with Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting among potential targets; talks continue with Brentford over Mbeumo signing; Inter Milan considering move for Rasmus Hojlund",
      "Friday 6 June 2025 21:52, UK",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres having worked with him before.",
      "Gyokeres is one of a number of forwards United are looking at.",
      "No formal contact has taken place between the clubs yet some reports in Portugal suggest Gyokeres wants to join a club in the Champions League.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too.",
      "United are expecting offers for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony - among others.",
      "Talks continue between Manchester United and Brentford over the signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United's first bid, which was worth up to £55m, was rejected.",
      "United will be disciplined this summer with all their transfer activity. They have a price in mind for all the players they are interested in and will not overpay.",
      "They have other targets and are prepared to walk away from any deal if it doesn't work for them.",

      "Man Utd have said they are in line with PSR and UEFA financial rules as they announced an increase in revenue in their Q3 results.",
      "United's revenue increased by 17.4 per cent to £160.5m, while wages across the business decreased by £20m to £71.2m for the three months to the end of March.",
      "The club says revenues increased due to the extra games in the Europa League and wages decreased due to the \"impact of transactions made during the January transfer window... and reduced non-playing staff costs as a result of the club's restructuring process.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford and Antony left the club on loan in the January transfer window.",
      "A statement said: \"The club remains committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules and UEFA's Financial Fair Play Regulations.\"",
