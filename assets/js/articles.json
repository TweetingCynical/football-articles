      "Brentford boss Thomas Frank has warned Manchester United that Bryan Mbeumo will cost \"a lot\" of money this summer. The Cameroon international was one of the Premier League's most-potent attackers this season, notching up 20 goals and seven assists for the Bees.",
      "However, Brentford have reluctantly accepted that after nearly six years in west London, Mbeumo could now be set to depart the club and move onto pastures new.",
      "United and Newcastle are eyeing the 25-year-old but Frank insists the Bees won't rollover during transfer negotiations.",
      "The Dane told Tipsbladet: “It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot.",
      "“Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for.\"",
      "When asked to shed light on the extent of potential interest, Frank added: “I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don’t look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",
      "Between Mbeumo and fellow forward Yoane Wissa, the pair hit 39 goals in the Premier League this term despite losing Ivan Toney to Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli last summer.",
      "Mbeumo has just over one year left to run on his current contract but Brentford do have a one-year extension option which the club can activate. United are in the market for attacking reinforcements for Ruben Amorim but they're operating with limited finances after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham. They've now activated Matheus Cunha's release clause, worth £62.5million, so their spending power will now be dictated by player sales.",
      "Newcastle have long been chasing Mbeumo and he has been on their radar for some time while Arsenal had previously looked at the highly-rated winger.",
      "Speaking towards the end of the season, Frank admitted that Brentford remain a selling club and pinpointed that unfortunately, they would struggle to keep hold of their best players moving forward.",
      "The Bees narrowly missed out on UEFA Conference League football but they did secure their second top-half finish in three seasons, ending up in 10th spot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United needed to come from behind in Hong Kong on Friday as they brought their miserable season to a close in what could end up being Bruno Fernandes' last game for the club. There was at least one bright spark, though, with Chido Obi's double turning a half-time deficit into victory.",
      "After a shock defeat in midweek against the ASEAN All Stars, Ruben Amorim wanted a response. There were some promising early moments, but it was Hong Kong who struck first as Juninho's effort beat Tom Heaton all too easily.",
      "It remained 1-0 at the break, and United boss Ruben Amorim changed his entire XI at the break. The changes bore fruit within a few minutes, with Obi equalising impressively, and fellow sub Ayden Heaven had a chance to make it 2-1.",
      "There was still some danger on the break, though, with sub keeper Altay Bayindir needing to be alert to deny Lau Ka Kiu midway through the second period. As the match entered the final 20 minutes, though, United kicked on and Kobbie Mainoo got an opening but couldn't keep his shot down.",
      "United also saw a penalty appeal waved away when Mason Mount went down in the box. It was Obi who settled the tie, though, sending a glancing header into the far corner, and Heaven's stoppage-time header made it three.",
      "United looked full of energy in the opening minutes, with Rasmus Hojlund getting a sight of goal early on, but the striker was unable to beat Hong Kong keeper Ka Wing Tse. United had the ball in the net not long after, with Casemiro sending a diving header into the nt, but the flag went up for offside.",
      "Tse made a couple more sharp saves insde the first half hour to keep Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho at bay. The pair were among the senior stars handed starts by Ruben Amorim, while youngsters including Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got minutes from the get-go",
      "Before the game, much of the conversation surrounded Bruno Fernandes. He was reported to be open to a United exit. Al Hilal appear to be the most likely suitors, with a £100million transfer fee mooted as well as a £200m contract.",
      "United are said to be relaxed about the situation, and there was no danger of their skipper sitting this one out. His usual creativity was on show early on, but Casemiro hasd strayed just offside before heading home the captain's free-kick.",
      "He came close to breaking the deadlock with another free-kick, with the ball moving wildly and almost deceiving Tse. There was an even bigger chance 10 minutes before half-time, but he opted to attempt a rabona when one-on-one with the keeper and saw it blocked, and only time will tell whether that ends up being Fernandes' final game for the club",
      "It was another scoreless game for Rasmus Hojlund, despite his early sight of goal. A second chance arrived late in the first half, only for the Dane to allow an opposition defender to snuff out the chance, and his recent record still stands at just one goal in the last month.",
      "Chido Obi found things far easier after taking his place, though. The young striker replaced Hojlund for the second half and wasted little time finding the net.",
      "His goal was an impressive one, too, with the teenager spinning and firing confidently into the bottom corner. He had more chances before his late winner, and the movement was something Hojlund lacked during his 45 minutes.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho si another who could be on his way, and perhaps he saw this game as a chance to show his quality and willing to potential buyers. He delivered a jinking run and early shot to test Hong Kong's keeper early on, and another run saw him set up a great chance which Shea Lacey sent wide of the far post.",
      "In recent weeks, Garnacho's exit has looked like a matter of when and not if. The same thing appeared to be true in January as well, though, and he ended up sticking around.",
      "Amorim may well have already decided Garnacho is among those players who needs to be sold to raise transfer funds. At his best, though, he can certainly be a difference-maker - it just so happens that he may end up taking on that role for someone else next season.",
      "Heavy rain in Hong Kong ahead of the game made the pitch slow at times, and United paid the penalty. Most notably, Garnacho looked poised to connect with an inviting early cross from Jaydan Kamason, only for the ball to hold up on the turf and allow an opposition defender to clear up.",
      "It was harder to determine whether the slippery conditions might have had something to do with the opener. Either way, the veteran will feel as though he was beaten too easily by the first shot to come his way.",
      "A bigger challenge in difficult conditions can be the risk of injury. Thankfully for United, there was no sign of any setback on that front.",
      "Ahead of the game, Ruben Amorim spoke about his decision to continue blooding first-teamers during the tour. \"Yes because we need to respect and do better than the last game,\" he said.",
      "\"We understand the players are tired from all the commercial things for our fans. Now it's time to perform to show good things for our fans.\"",
      "It has been, by every conceivable measure, a season to forget for United. It's now over, though, and they can finally look towards the future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Paul Scholes has urged Manchester United to cash in on Bruno Fernandes this summer because the £100million sum offered for him is too good to turn down. The Red Devils legend also believes Fernandes can be detrimental to Ruben Amorim’s tactics because he “confuses the system”.",
      "The Portugal international, 30, has become a top priority of Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window. Al-Hilal are understood to have held lengthy talks with Fernandes’ representatives over a lucrative contract this week, with those discussions improving their chances of signing the United captain.",
      "Fernandes, who joined the Red Devils in January 2020, led the side to their worst-ever Premier League finish this term. And it is believed he is seriously considering quitting United next week as Al-Hilal look to sign the playmaker in time to field him at the upcoming Club World Cup.",
      "Fernandes himself has failed to provide any assurances about his future, while his post-match interview comments after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham last week sparked concerns that he was ready to leave.",
      "Old Trafford bosses, however, are reportedly relaxed about the situation and are willing to listen to offers for any member of their squad, including Fernandes. Having missed out on a significant windfall by failing to qualify for the Champions League, INEOS understand that they will need to sell players in order to rebuild the squad while complying with strict Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Equally relaxed about Fernandes' potential departure is club legend Scholes. The 11-time Premier League champion said on The Overlap Fan Debate: “They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that.",
      "“You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position? Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "“He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong. But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”",
      "Pundit Jamie Carragher agreed, saying: “I’ve always described Bruno Fernandes as a great talent but not a great player. Where does he play?",
      "“He’s a bit mad in that he just runs all over the place, like a kid in the school yard. The best player in the school yard doing everything but in a really poor team. I don’t think he’s ever had any discipline in those No. 10 positions.”",
      "The four-time United Player of the Season's manager, Amorim, however, has made it clear he wants Fernandes to stay. The Portuguese head coach sang the midfielder’s praises during the club’s post-season trip to Asia this week.",
      "Asked about the present situation, Amorim said: \"We’ve talked about this many times. You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership.",
      "“You can see the passion he has for the game. In difficult moments Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.\"",

The Portuguese admitted that Bruno Fernandes started against Hong Kong because his team had to improve following a defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "The fixtures are set to land United around £8million in additional funds as the club, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, continues its attempts to find their way to more comfortable financial footing. Missing out on European football after a disastrous season in the Premier League has already seen each player made available for sale.",
      "A team including Andre Onana, Harry Maguire, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund lost United's opening game in Malaysia. Fernandes only played the second half of that fixture but the Red Devils captain was on the pitch from the outset against Hong Kong.",

      "However, the extension only materialised after Fernandes made it clear to United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he demanded the club recruit top-class players in order to compete with the very best.",
      "Yet United's current pull in the market is now under threat, meaning the midfielder is believed to be weighing up the decision to move on, with Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal said to be circling him.",
      "United's loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur and their subsequent inability to offer European football next season means luring some of the game's biggest stars to Old Trafford may prove difficult. Mounting financial concerns will also provide a hurdle for Ruben Amorim this summer.",
      "Speaking to the club's website upon signing his contract extension, Fernandes said: \"The club knew that I want to compete with the best teams. They knew that we needed to improve the team. And I think that we’re doing that.",
      "\"I said to the, ‘I don’t need you to promise me that we’re going to win the league, because no one can promise that. But at least that we will have a team to compete and be competitive throughout the season, to try to achieve silverware and to compete at the highest levels.'\"",
      "Under former manager Erik ten Hag, United did hold their end of the deal last summer. Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte and Noussair Mazraoui were brought in for a combined fee believed to be in the region of £200million.",
      "However, Amorim has long been aware funds will likely be tight this summer. In a move that could signal some ambition to Fernandes, it's understood that United are looking to wrap up a £62.5m deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Regardless, Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, is already believed to have held discussions with Al-Hilal about a stunning £100m transfer. United have also refused to rule out his possible sale after insisting that every member of their underperforming squad is up for sale.",
      "Al-Hilal are eager to conclude a deal quickly so Fernandes, 30, can play for them in the Club World Cup in the United States next month. After United's Europa League final defeat, Fernandes cast doubt on his future by suggesting the club could \"cash in\" on him.",
      "United signed Fernandes from Sporting CP in January 2020 for a fee rising to £67.7million. He was United's top scorer in 2024/25 with 19 goals and he retained the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award - an accolade he has won in four out of his six seasons at the club.",

      "Florian Wirtz has been told Arne Slot is a better manager than Erik ten Hag as the Liverpool boss was revealed to have played a major role in the German's potential move to Anfield. The future of the Bayer Leverkusen star was already set to be a major talking point this summer with the Premier League champions, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City all in the hunt for the 22-year-old.",
      "Conversations surrounding Wirtz's next move indicated that a transfer to the German champions was most likely until he conducted a meeting with Slot, alongside his father and agent, Hans-Joachim Wirtz.",
      "The intervention from the Reds boss was said to have proved critical in the attacking midfielder deciding to snub Bayern in order to move abroad for the first time in his career.",
      "According to Bild, the meeting on May 13 saw Slot provide Wirtz with a clear picture of where he'll fit within his title-winning team and was promised of a starring role in the side's attack.",
      "Becoming enamoured with promises of a central role within one of the world's best teams, as well as being informed of the fervent support that the club possesses from their fans, resulted in Wirtz's father informing Bayern executives Uli Hoeness and Max Eberl that it was Liverpool who had won the race for his son's signature.",
      "Wirtz could have ended up playing for Ten Hag next season, had he chosen to remain with Leverkusen, after the former Manchester United boss was announced as their new manager following the departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid.",
      "However, a move to Liverpool will see the Wirtz team up with the better manager, according to Mark Diemers. The Cambuur midfielder enjoyed spells playing under both managers, having spent a brief period alongside the ex-United boss at Utrecht before joining Slot during his time at Feyenoord.",
      "Best positioned to give an opinion on the managerial abilities of both men, the 31-year-old had a clear opinion when admitting who he enjoyed working with more. \"I choose Arne Slot,\" he told ESPN Netherlands last year when asked about the best manager he has worked with.",
      "\"I can only talk from my time. I found Ten Hag insanely good tactically, so were his training sessions. I just didn’t think he was very good, at that time, on a human level. But that was already six or seven years ago. I thought Slot was a lot stronger on a human level.",
      "\"Look at what kind of clubs [Ten Hag] has worked at, so he must also have qualities on a human level. I still have contact with him via WhatsApp. Then he also comes across as very friendly to me. He will undoubtedly have grown on a human level as well.\"",
      "Despite the lack of consistent success in Manchester – and some issues in the dressing room – Ten Hag still managed to win two trophies in his time at the club as he made sure to maintain his status as a manager who is adept in capturing silverware.",
      "Ten Hag also won plaudits for his style of play at Ajax, which encouraged United to initially make a move for the 55-year-old. However, it's Slot who has arguably managed to cement himself as the better of the two in recent times following title successes with Feyenoord and, of course, Liverpool in his first season in as boss of the Premier League club."

It didn't take long for Ince to establish himself in Serie A. He dominated the midfield while wearing the No. 8 shirt of the Nerazzurri, and their iconic fan base took him in as one of their own - quite literally on one occasion.",

While that supporter was left tasting their own blood, the ex-England international was hooked on the adrenaline rush of being with the fanbase - and nearly 30 years later, there's only one thing Ince wants to do.",

To this day, I want to do it again, I’d love to do it again. I did not get many red cards in the Premier League. But in Italy, it was different. Players were rolling over, feigning injuries.",

Fernandes is said to be seriously weighing up a move amid a mega-money offer from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "Despite United's dismal season, finishing 15th in the Premier League, Fernandes once again was a standout player in the division. The Portuguese international scored 19 goals and provided 20 assists amidst a poor season for the club.",
      "United's captain is subject to a potential £100million transfer fee, and a huge £200m contract. The player's agent met with the suitors earlier this week, and talks are reported to have run late into the night as Al Hilal set a tight deadline on a decision from Fernandes with a Club World Cup campaign looming..",
      "United are said to be 'relaxed' regarding the situation with a £100m bid seeing a significant profit that they would be able to reinvest in the squad. But it would be no small feat to replace Fernandes' contributions in recent seasons.",
      "And it would ensure Amorim's task is all the more difficult heading into his first pre-season with the club. The 40-year-old has already made it clear how important he believes Fernandes to be.",
      "Amorim said on Tuesday that Fernandes \"is really important for us and what we want to build for the team. We talk about this many times.",
      "\"You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership. You can see the passion he has for the game.",
      "\"In difficult moments, Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.\"",
      "Fernandes however, appeared to accept that an exit could be on the cards earlier this month. The United star appeared to put the ball in the club's court over a move.",
      "Speaking after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, Fernandes said: \"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is.",

The Nigeria international spent last term on loan at Galatasaray after the Serie A side failed to secure a permanent move away for the forward after signing Romelu Lukaku.",

      "Italian outlet Il Napolista has claimed Hojlund could be used as part as a swap deal that would see Napoli part ways with Osimhen however. United may need to foot up an additional £33.7m to land the 26-year-old.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is said to have told intermediaries that Osimhen will be sold to the highest bidder this summer. The sharpshooter bagged 36 goals in 40 appearances in Turkey and the club is hoping that his €75m (£63m) release clause will be activated this summer.",
      "United's constrained finances mean that they may want to use Hojlund as a makeweight for Antonio Conte's side. And the Italian champions have already found success signing players from the 13-times Premier League and Scott McTominay has become a star since making the move.",

It is a strikingly similar situation to the one the Dutchman experienced at PSV Eindhoven, where he quit after telling players and staff he no longer felt “supported” by the club.",
      "History could very much repeat itself for the Foxes boss, who is still yet to receive any indication whether he will be kept on by the club going into next season. Leicester ended a dismal campaign with a 2-0 loss to Bournemouth last weekend as they fell back into the Championship.",
      "But current boss Van Nistelrooy says he is unable to plan for next season in the second tier and make signings because he hasn’t had a conversation with the board about the club’s plans. The 48-year-old said recently that whether he remains in charge “depends on how the conversations go”.",
      "And when quizzed about his plans for the upcoming season, Van Nistelrooy confessed: “I still have to wait at least to have a conversation on a future together or not. Before that, you cannot start planning. I need to speak to be able to get a feeling on hopes. It’s all dependent on that.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s state of limbo has fuelled speculation that he may be replaced by Russell Martin, formerly of Southampton, as the Foxes look for a manager with a prior history of clinching promotion to the Premier League.",
      "Van Nistelrooy has endured a disastrous tenure since replacing Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium in late November, which saw their relegation to the Championship confirmed in April.",
      "The Foxes were one point clear of the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but a dreadful run of form followed, which saw them lose a whopping 16 games from 18 played between December and February.",
      "And it’s not the first time Van Nistelrooy has found himself at odds with club bosses. The Manchester United legend quit his old job as PSV boss in May 2023 over a lack of support from the Dutch giants just a year after taking charge of the senior side.",
      "It came as somewhat of a surprise, given that he'd won a Johan Cruyff Shield and a TOTO KNVB Beker, while also looking set to finish in second place in the Eredivisie.",
      "PSV at the time alluded to his falling out with the board, releasing a statement, which read: \"Van Nistelrooy told the first-team squad and coaching staff that he would be stepping down with immediate effect, due to a lack of support within the club.",
      "\"PSV regrets his decision and is grateful to him for winning the Johan Cruijff Shield and the Dutch Cup, and hopes to finish the season in second place.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s next job came when he was appointed as Erik ten Hag's assistant ahead of the 2024/25 season. After a poor start to the campaign led to Ten Hag's dismissal, Van Nistelrooy took over in an interim capacity.",
      "The former Netherlands striker, however, was left feeling \"disappointed\" and \"hurt\" after being told to pack his bags by United's incoming boss, Ruben Amorim, who brought his own backroom team with him.",
      "Meanwhile, Van Nistelrooy’s potential successor, Martin, was sacked by the Saints in December and just 16 games into the Premier League season, having overseen an astonishing 13 defeats. Martin has also been touted for the vacant managerial position at Rangers.",

      "\"No, of course not,\" he said while speaking to Swedish outlet Aftonbladet from the national team's training ground. \"Because then it would be blown up like this [stretches arms].\"",

He added that he regularly speaks to his players about \"what would be a good and bad club,\" but it appears an exception will be made in Gyokeres' case, unless he reaches out for advice.",
      "\"There are definitely players changing clubs! We know that each year,\" he continued. \"If you look at each player, you need to make the right choice.",

      "His decision nearly haunted him, as the Reds mounted a thrilling, albeit doomed, Premier League title charge in 2013/14 under Brendan Rodgers, derailed by Steven Gerrard's infamous slip against Chelsea. In Istanbul, Sneijder's gamble paid dividends, as he powered Galatasaray to eight major trophies, including two Super Lig titles and three Turkish Cups. Yet, the siren call of the Premier League lingered.",
      "Reflecting on the Manchester United saga, Sneijder revealed that talks with the Red Devils were gaining momentum in 2010, only to collapse abruptly. It wasn't until years later, during a chance encounter between his father and legendary former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, that the truth behind the failed transfer emerged, shedding light on one of modern football's great 'what-ifs.'",
      "\"I didn't know the reason - I didn't ask my agent. He just said they [United] didn't call anymore and I believed it. But many years later, like five or six years later, my father was in Manchester with a friend of his, and they walked into a place where Sir Alex Ferguson was.",
      "\"And he spoke to my father and he said he was interested in me, that he wanted to sign me, but that there was a problem with the agent. So that was the problem - which I didn't know before. That's the information I have now.",
      "\"Obviously, it would have been a great move. After winning everything to go to a big club like Man United would have been amazing. But also, I had a great time at Inter Milan, and after that I had a great move to Galatasaray... it just didn't happen.\"",
      "Sneijder, now 40, launched his storied career at Ajax, honing his craft before a high-profile 2007 transfer to Real Madrid. In his debut season, he clinched the La Liga title, but the arrival of the second Galacticos era - headlined by Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, and Karim Benzema - pushed him out in 2009.",
      "Revenge came swiftly, though, as Sneijder, under Jose Mourinho, helped new club Inter clinch a famous Treble, capped by a 2-0 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich at the Bernabeu - his former home. After securing six major titles in three-and-a-half years at the San Siro, he joined Galatasaray, before stints at Nice and Qatari outfit Al-Gharafa.",
      "Internationally, Sneijder's 134 caps - a Dutch record - saw him shine at six major tournaments. His pinnacle came at the 2010 World Cup, where he led the Netherlands to the final, claimed joint-top scorer honours, and earned the Silver Ball as the tournament's second-best player.",
      "Sneijder's career, defined by trophies as well as near-misses, remains a testament to his unwavering pursuit of glory over glamour. While the Premier League's allure never truly faded, his choice to chase success in the fervent footballing cauldrons of Milan and Istanbul over England's uncertain promises proved his instinct for winning was as sharp as his playmaking."

      "Amad has defended his decision to show the middle finger to supporters during Manchester United's post-season tour. The United forward went viral after a video of him swearing towards fans in Malaysia was widely shared on social media.",
      "The incident happened outside United's hotel in Kuala Lumpur, with the club in the Malaysian capital to play the ASEAN All-Stars in a friendly on Wednesday. United went on to lose the game 1-0 - and their disastrous trip wasn't helped by the negative attention brought by Amad's actions.",
      "However, the club have defended the 22-year-old, who they say was responding to \"serious personal abuse\" about his mother. Amad himself wrote on X: \"I have respect for people but not for the one who insults my mom…",
      "\"I shouldn't have reacted like that but I don't regret what I did. We had a great time in Malaysia with good people.\"",
      "The abuse happened while United's players left the team hotel for their coach. There was a large group of supporters gathered to greet them and, in one of the videos on social media, they can be heard shouting Amad's name in an effort to get his attention.",
      "It is understood that what Amad took offense to wasn't racist, but rather that fans were shouting \"Diallo\" at him. The Ivory Coast international has previously requested to be known solely by his first name, following some controversy involving a trafficking case from his time at previous club Atalanta.",
      "Amad was fined £42,000 by the Italian FA in 2021 after an investigation into allegations he used false documents and fake parents to get into Italy. United signed him for an initial fee of £19million - which could rise to £37m - from Atalanta in January 2021 and, after a successful loan spell at Sunderland, he has become a regular first-team player.",
      "He will be involved when United play Hong Kong in the second of their post-season tour games, which have been embarked upon to earn the struggling club around £7.8m.",
      "Having used 25 outfield players in the embarrassing loss in Malaysia, Ruben Amorim will again rotate his team against Hong Kong, albeit without Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Andre Onana, who have flown on to a fan engagement event in India.",
      "United did not shy away from the Amad incident in Kuala Lumpur, having put him up for the press conference in Hong Kong, where he fielded questions about his close friend Alejandro Garnacho, who is expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "“Alejandro is a really good player and we need good players in the team,” Amad told reporters when asked if he hoped Garnacho might stay. “I know Garna really well, so I hope to have Garna next season. It is not really a big issue for the team. Everything is good now.\"",
      "Speaking about his plans for the Hong Kong match, Amorim said: “I will try to divide because I don’t want all the young kids all together. I will try to mix these things. We want to be competitive. If they are fit, they will play, and we will have the maximum respect for everybody here and for our fans.”",

United need a proven goalscorer, not one born four days after Hojlund and jettisoned by City’s academy to a promoted team who Jason Wilcox watched develop. United tried to cut corners with Delap’s release clause when they need a proven commodity.",

      "The 17-year-old ought to have converted with one header and the next time he rose to meet the ball he glanced it into the corner. With fan favourites long since substituted, the crowd in the Hong Kong Stadium switched their affections to Obi.",
      "Obi was still pressing intensely in added time. One of United staff’s bugbears with Hojlund is they reckon he does not exert himself enough. Obi applied himself as though he sensed an opportunity. His tour ended with a man of the match award.",

Whoever United’s starting striker is next season, Obi has had enough time around the first team to at least remain involved in that set-up for what will be a sparser season without European football.",
      "There was little to savour when he scored his first goal as United were 1-0 down again. Their first half performance was in keeping with their annus horribilis; not scoring before conceding. United conceded the first goal in 32 of their 60 competitive games and they have tagged on a couple more in the post-season.",

      "The players will not be doom-scrolling on their smartphones when they board their flight back to Manchester on Friday evening.",
      "This was certainly a farewell appearance for Jonny Evans and possibly Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim had been asked at his pre-match press conference whether both would start after Lionel Messi caused a furore in Hong Kong last year by withdrawing from an Inter Miami exhibition match. Fernandes and Garnacho were in the United line-up that pressed the flesh of local dignitaries.",

      "The United captain was still his usual self, bickering with Casemiro after his teammate strayed offside for a disallowed goal and advising Harry Amass to chest the ball rather than hopefully stick his leg out.",
      "Fernandes might have signed-off with one of his most audacious United goals but his one-on-one rabona - when one leg is wrapped around the other to poke the ball forward - was repelled. Hojlund naturally miscontrolled the ball on the follow-up before Jaydan Kamason’s drive was blocked on the line.",
      "It sounded suspiciously like a fan wielding a megaphone shouted, “Garnacho, you’re f*****g s**t.” Garnacho can take criticism to heart and was soon on his haunches on a cool and wet evening. It transpired that the fleeting rendition emanated from a section populated by Hong Kong fans.",
      "The Hong Kong ‘keeper Tse Ka Wing kept out Hojlund and Garnacho before Shea Lacey screwed a clear chance well wide. Lacey was substituted before the half-hour mark yet it was an achievement for him to be in Asia after a season where he was restricted to four starts for the academy. Starting for the first team was an unexpected reward.",

      "Another chance goes begging for United. A corner comes in from the right, Fredricson meets it with a firm header, but nods it straight at the goalkeeper.",
      "That was comical. The audacity of Fernandes' attempt, the first touch from Hojlund and the shot cleared off the line. You have to laugh. United have played enjoyable football but they could not score in a you-know-what.",
      "With the exception of Juninho's shot that has given Hong Kong the lead in this game, the hosts have offered nothing. They have rarely got close to United's penalty area to trouble Heaton.",
      "United have enjoyed almost all of the ball and had chances. But as was so often the case during the season, the Reds have not capitliased on their dominance.",
      "It was an achievement for Lacey just to be out here, never mind come on in one game and start in another. He should have got a goal and that will be another learning curve. What he doesn't need is some ridiculous overhyping that has followed him for a few years already.",
      "Amorim makes two changes with less than 30 minutes on the clock;",
      "OFF: Casemiro & Lacey",
      "ON: T. Fletcher & Kone",
      "Both sets of players have just come across to the touchline to get take some liquids on board. It is not as warm as it was in Malaysia, but it is by no means cool in Hong Kong."

      "Yesterday was another tough one for United's recruitment department as one of their top targets decided to go elsewhere. Ipswich Town's Liam Delap has chosen to join Chelsea despite the Reds being able to activate his release clause of £30m.",
      "It is expected that the Blues will complete his deal this week and that means United need to turn their attention to alternatives. Napoli's Victor Osimhen is being heavily linked as an option for the Reds in lieu of Delap.",
      "There have been reports that recruitment director Matt Hargreaves is in Naples to try and thrash out a deal. Osimhen will likely want to get his business done sooner rather than later, considering how his exit last summer fell through on deadline day.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked to United thanks to his close relationship with Ruben Amorim. However, it appears the Reds are in a long queue for him which now looks to include Liverpool.",

      "In January, the Reds agreed a loan deal until the end of the season with the Seville club for Antony and it was an unexpected success.",
      "United's loanee became a key player for Real Betis and helped them qualify for the Conference League final. Despite falling just short of European glory, it remains a good season for the La Liga club as they bagged a spot in next season's Europa League thanks to their domestic finish.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has urged the club to accept a £100million offer for Bruno Fernandes this summer, stating that the sum is too large to refuse.",
      "He also expressed concerns that Fernandes disrupts Ruben Amorim's tactics as he \"confuses the system\". The Portuguese international, 30, has reportedly become a top target for Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "It's understood that Al-Hilal have been in lengthy talks with Fernandes' representatives about a lucrative contract this week, which has increased their chances of signing the United captain.",

      "The United duo hold good relationships with Ten Hag and both men are available to be sold this summer.",
      "While on the surface it seems like a disaster that Gyokeres and Delap look set to move to clubs that aren't United, Amorim has already insisted that he is unfazed if they choose another team.",
      "In a press conference when asked about the importance of Champions League football to attract players, Amorim insisted that players would be signing for the wrong reasons if they only wanted to play for United because of the competition.",
      "Gyokeres deal? I didn't talk to him. But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.",

      "Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations. Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season, even the environment in training ground can help all these players have more confidence. If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals we will try to assess that and be prepared.",
      "According to Football Insider, Newcastle are leading United in the race to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "The versatile attacking midfielder is thought to be available for £50m this summer.",

      "Speaking recently, Amorim explained:",
      "You can see by the performance, you can see by the leadership, the passion that he has for the game, so he’s really important. You could see that in the last game [Sunday’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa]. I felt that the team was without pressure and they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball. But we had some difficult moments and in those difficult moments you can see that Bruno is the guy that takes that responsibility. He should be because he’s the captain, he’s experienced, so he’s really important for us, and really important for what we want to build with this team.",
      "According to The Athletic, who have matched the information we have received, there is a feeling internally that Al Hilal's interest in Fernandes could have a knock on affect.",
      "It is believed that United sense that if they entertain a bid from the Saudi Pro League club, European teams will also enter the race for their captain.",

      "After a disappointing 2024/25 campaign, Manchester United will have been hoping their transfer strategy to help move past this was watertight.",
      "So with United being dealt a considerable blow in landing one of their top two targets, MEN Sport writers have their say here on how United can move past Delap and find another suitable target.",
      "Everyone connected with Manchester United knows they must sign a striker this summer.",
      "It's why there may be some disconnect that the Reds have missed out on what looked to be a relatively simple deal to sign Ipswich Town's Liam Delap. Here is a player with Premier League experience who is available for £30million after the Tractor Boys' relegation to English football's second tier.",
      "But would a young striker like Delap be able to cope with the pressure of leading the line for Ruben Amorim's side? It's a responsibility that has weighed heavily on the shoulders of Rasmus Hojlund since arriving from Atalanta. Moving from Ipswich to Old Trafford would be a huge step up.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United have been handed an update on Kobbie Mainoo amid transfer speculation surrounding the midfielder.",
      "Reports in March from The Guardianclaimed that Mainoo is minded to reject the offer of a new contract at ­Old Trafford and seek a move abroad. With just two years left on his current deal, United might eventually have to sell. The Reds' PSR position will likely force their hand.",
      "It is claimed that United value Mainoo at around £70million, but the question is whether any foreign club would be able to afford that fee. Only Premier League clubs tend to pay that price, unless you are Real Madrid, who may be too big of a step up for the Englishman right now.",

      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has sent a message on social media as his loan spell with Chelsea nears an end.",
      "Sancho relocated to west London on a season-long loan last summer, with the winger looking for a new lease of life after struggling at United since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. Due to the Blues' Premier League position being higher than 14th, Chelsea are now obliged to purchase the forward for £25million.",
      "However, it is believed that there is a £5m break clause that can be paid to withdraw from the deal, which would result in Sancho returning to Old Trafford. If this occurs, it is understood that he will not be reintegrated back into the United squad.",

      "The report adds that United would have made a move if they won the Europa League.",
      "In the last hour and a half we brought you reports that United are in Naples trying to organise a deal for Osimhen.",
      "From Napoli's perspective, while they are tough negotiators, they are also in a position where they need to sell Osimhen sooner rather than later.",
      "The Serie A champions have already started spending their money that they are looking to receive for the striker.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne, Jonathan David and Edon Zhegrova are all players that Napoli are reportedly working to sign.",
      "But, they are doing so hoping that Osimhen leaves so the sooner a deal is done the better and this could play into United's hands perfectly.",
      "According to The Athletic's David Ornstein, an agreement between Chelsea and Ipswich Town has been agreed for Delap.",
      "The Blues have activated Delap's £30m release clause ahead of his purchase.",
      "It is reported that personal terms still need to be agreed but no issue is expected there.",
      "For United, the Conference League final could not have gone much better.",
      "Before the game, Antony had already proven his worth ahead of the summer but there was still question marks about Sancho.",
      "Therefore, it did not matter that Antony had a quiet game, that will not affect the chances of him finding a new permanent home.",
      "Sancho needed to perform especially if, as is predicted, Chelsea will not pay £25m for him.",
      "He put himself in the shop window in the Conference League final and United will hope that this cameo will earn them a transfer fee if Chelsea pull out.",
      "In another blow for United, handed to them by Chelsea, it appears the Blues are leaning away from the idea of signing Sancho for £25m.",
      "According to The Guardian, as per their report on Delap choosing Chelsea over United, they believe that the Conference League holders are leaning towards not paying £25m for Sancho.",
      "While Enzo Maresca is thought to be a fan of the winger, he is believed to be unsure whether the forward is consistent enough.",
      "United now know that one of their main targets for this summer is destined to move to Chelsea.",
      "Fabrizio Romano understands that Chelsea's Champions League football next season was a contributing factor towards Delap wanting a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Our colleagues at football.london add that their current co-director of recruitment Joe Shields is a big fan of Delap having been at Manchester City when the forward signed from Derby County.",
      "According to Il Napolista, United are turning their attention to Napoli striker Victor Osimhen after missing out on Delap.",
      "It is claimed that recruitment chief Matt Hargreaves has flown to Naples to try and thrash out a deal for Osimhen.",
      "Napoli want to sell the talisman who scored 36 goals for Galatasaray on loan this season but will want Rasmus Hojlund in return, plus £33.5m.",
      "United were believed to have £30m saved up to activate Delap's release clause so it is not too much more that Ineos would need to stump up to bring the Nigerian to the Premier League.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog on Thursday afternoon.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the next couple of hours keeping you across all the latest news surrounding United.",
      "If you are just joining us today, here's a catch up on what you have missed:",
      "To kick us off here, there could be a Plan B starting to form as an alternative to Delap...",
      "Man United CEO Omar Berrada has discussed the club's transfer plans for the first time since the season finish.",
      "Speaking in Malaysia, he said:",
      "I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now.",
      "We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do. We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve.",
      "So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition.",

His £30million release clause made him an obtainable target and with United, who are closing in on a £62.5million deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, not flush with cash this summer Delap's price point and quality made him an attractive option.",
      "Instead, United are paying the price for a dismal Premier League campaign and losing the Europa League final earlier this month which ended any hope of European football at Old Trafford next season. Delap seems set to complete his move to Stamford Bridge imminently.",
      "So what next? United are desperate to sign a striker this summer given Rasmus Hojlund's struggles and Joshua Zirkee's preference to play deeper. In an ideal world, Ruben Amorim would be chasing a reunion with Sporting Lisbon powerhouse Viktor Gyokeres, or joining the race for the talented Benjamin Sesko or the free agent Jonathan David. But all three will want Champions league football and United don't have it.",
      "Even the proven top flight alternatives to Delap, the likes of Brentford star Yoane Wissa and Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta could be financially out of reach for United with Premier League signings often attracting a premium.",
      "It means the Reds might have to cast the net further afield in their search for attacking options. And a look at the Bundesliga could provide an answer.",
      "A look down the list of top scorers, which is led by Harry Kane, sees the unheralded Jonathan Burkardt in fourth. The striker hit 18 goals last term to fire Mainz into Europe.",
      "At 24, he has more than 100 senior appearances for Mainz, who often deploy a 3-4-3 shape not dissimilar to Amorim's formation at United, under his belt and has broken into the Germany national side. Indeed, he is a candidate to be starting forward for his country when the 2026 World Cup rolls around next year.",
      "He's long been touted as a potential star in the making in his homeland and is now delivering on that promise.",

      "United were woeful in front of in the 2024-25 campaign, but the addition of Cunha as a number 10 will likely improve that tally, while Burkardt is more of a line-leading presence than Hojlund.",

      "If Fernandes does leave the club this summer, it would present a major challenge for United to replace him. Not just the captain's armband but also the creative spark in midfield that has been so valuable to the club since his arrival in 2020 from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "United could already be on the path to replacing Fernandes based on their first piece of transfer business this summer.",
      "Wolves star Matheus Cunha is a target for United and is reportedly on the verge of completing a move to Old Trafford. The Brazilian has a £62.5million release clause in his contract at Molineux, with various reports suggesting a deal is close to being agreed.",
      "Cunha and Fernandes typically play in different positions, with the Wolves star in the forward line or as a No.10. Fernandes, meanwhile, has been utilised in midfield the majority of his United career, although Ruben Amorim has started Fernandes further forward at times this season.",
      "Fernandes has been one of United's most creative players during his time at Old Trafford. An exit could see the club look to Cunha to fill the void left by the Portugal international's departure, but a lot has to happen for this reality to become real."

      "Concerns over Alejandro Garnacho's attitude may mean he's bound to leave Manchester United this summer. And one former Carrington coach provided early warning signs about the South American's supposed character flaws.",
      "There’s growing speculation manager Ruben Amorim is prepared to offload Garnacho after the player was left out of United's last match of the season against Aston Villa. The Argentina international was previously dropped from the XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, after which Garnacho publicly expressed his frustration at a \"s***\" season.",
      "Justin Cochrane previously helped lead United's academy when Garnacho starred in the under-18s' FA Youth Cup victory in 2022. The then-17-year-old winger crowned that campaign by winning the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, identifying himself as a future first-team talent.",
      "Cochrane, now a first-team coach at Brentford, noted the player's exceptional talent but also alluded to a mismatch between his conduct and prowess on the pitch. And while he refrained from being overly critical of the young talent, there were hints of possible issues with his behaviour.",
      "Talking to Goal in March 2022 about his efforts to keep Garnacho's ego in check, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender followed up by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. However, the conversation again shifted to prioritising modesty, something that might not have come unless there were existing concerns.",
      "\"My job and the staff's job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" Cochrane added. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that's what we're focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United manager to have issues with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously chastised by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts criticising his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth in April 2024.",
      "Ten Hag later revealed his player had apologised for the incident, suggesting they had put the matter behind them. However, Garnacho was subsequently dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, shortly before he was sacked, for once again liking posts critical of the coach.",
      "Cochrane's comments from 2022 suggest a recurring pattern of behaviour that most coaches would prefer to avoid. And it seems Amorim has reached his limit, with the player apparently free to leave if an appropriate offer is made.",
      "Napoli have shown significant interest in the player during recent transfer windows. However, this potential move may be at risk due to reports suggesting Antonio Conte is ready to depart the club after just one season, having clinched the Serie A title.",
      "This could leave United in a rush to find a club willing to match their valuation for the player. But there's no confusion, it seems, that Amorim is ready to part ways should any outfit stump up the cash, with United supposedly wanting upwards of £60million."

      "Friendlies can be an effective cure for insomniacs and this had all the hallmarks of unwatchable exhibition matches: A lack of goals, 27 players used by United alone, a light show and a Mexican Wave midway through the second half. Soccer Aid might be more competitive and dynamic.",
      "United first visited Malaysia 30 years ago and United at their very worst since relegation still drew a crowd: 72,550 was the official attendance in the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "True to form, United did not provide the game’s only goal as they went 1-0 down for the umpteenth time in the past 12 months. In the 84th minute, there was the familiar scenario of a United winger crossing into the penalty area only for the striker to be nowhere in sight.",
      "Five minutes later, Alejandro Garnacho abandoned selflessness but his shot was wayward. Bruno Fernandes looked at the heavens and his shoulders slumped. A familiar feeling. United got so desperate that Tom Heaton went up for an added-time corner.",

      "6,606 miles is an exceedingly long way to travel for a match you will learn nothing from. United have not pretended that the football is the priority on this commercial trip that will rake in £8million and the only positive was that some of their callow academy members were granted minutes.",
      "Garnacho briefly vanished down the tunnel during the first half, possibly to maximise the air conditioning. He was selected for the start of the second half and was cheered when he headed over to the far side. They were louder when Garnacho got the ball. Time will tell if it was the last time in the red of United.",
      "Eleven minutes into the second half, Garnacho was on his haunches, briefly overwhelmed by the humidity. The players had to peel their shirts off as though they had been stuck on.",
      "Andre Onana had his name aired for the first time in United colours. Harry Maguire was booed by casual spectators in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin but here in Kuala Lumpur was cheered louder than ever whenever he received the ball.",
      "This was the first occasion that Maguire had captained United from the start since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, extra validation for a player who had his contract extended earlier in the year.",
      "Fernandes inevitably generated the loudest chant upon his half-time arrival. Even Fernandes’ rabona - when a player wraps one leg around the other and pokes the ball forward - that went out for a goal kick drew widespread ‘ooh’s.",
      "The chanting briefly switched to \"Bruno stay, Bruno stay\". Fernandes could have clarified his future by now and has not done so. United have another press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday evening.",
      "The United fans were not entirely enthusiastic. An errant pass from Toby Collyer elicited jeers, with fans willing United to at least score.",
      "You work up a sweat just by sitting down in this part of the world. Fans were handed out to fans, it was that sweltering. Omar Berrada remained statesman-like, arriving in a club suit when he could have been forgiven for donning casual attire. Jason Wilcox is not in Asia ahead of the defining summer of his administrative career.",
      "When United were last in Asia in Bangkok three years ago, Jurgen Klopp played three different Liverpool outfield XIs against them. By the 20-minute mark at the Bukit Jalil, Shea Lacey, Jaydan Kamason, Dan Armer and Sekou Kone were already limbering up with the fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The quartet came on ten minutes later during a drinks break. Jack Moorhouse's maiden first-team exposure lasted 30 minutes. Casemiro, whose 19-month exile from the Brazil national squad ended with Carlos Ancelotti's appointment, gratefully traipsed off.",
      "Amorim was more drastic than Klopp. There were 11 changes at half-time, so Lacey, Kone, Armer and Kamason were not even afforded a quarter of the match. All but one of the second-half XI played 45 minutes.",
      "United used 27 players, overall. Altay Bayindir was the only unused matchday squad member, with Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount all clad in leisure gear. United have another game in less than 48 hours, a four-hour flight away, in Hong Kong.",

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "The latest reports indicate that Barcelona will sign Rashford on loan next season.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Any Saudi Pro League club\nWe simply can’t see it. Surely even a reconciliation at Manchester United would be better than the desert.",
      "",
      "4=) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – they are bound for the Europa League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4=) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – were said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6=) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "6=) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "6=) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but they sneaked back into the Champions League, so they could be an option.",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. And they surely become an option again after reaching the Champions League.",
      "",

      "32) 2003 – Juventus 0-0 Milan (2-3 on penalties)\nIt might seem reductive to consider the only goalless Champions League final as the worst, but the 2003 edition truly was a slog. It wasn’t without its moments – Andriy Shevchenko’s cruelly disallowed goal, Antonio Conte hitting the post and Andrea Pirlo striking the bar – but that second half in particular was a test of spectator endurance more than anything.",
      "Their Serie A meetings that season ended in a 2-1 win apiece but Old Trafford was treated to nothing of the sort. Even half the penalties were missed in the shootout as Dida ventured ever so slightly off his line.",
      "",
      "31) 2004 – Monaco 0-3 Porto\nTo prove that goals do not necessarily equate to a pulsating game, watch the 2004 Champions League final and retain your consciousness for the full 90 minutes. An audience not quite anaesthetised to the stylings of Jose Mourinho found that the novelty of two surprise success stories had worn off long before full-time as the Portuguese starved the occasion of any intrigue.",
      "Monaco failed to muster a single shot on target; Porto themselves only managed four as they registered less than 50% possession.",
      "",
      "30) 2010 – Bayern Munich 0-2 Inter Milan\nAs the BBC said at the time, it ‘might not have been one for the purists’. Mourinho was once at great pains to point out that he couldn’t properly empathise with Tottenham upon his appointment as manager in November 2019 because “I never lost a Champions League final”. This was a fine example as to why, as Inter channelled the determination and resilience of their semi-final victory over Barcelona to secure a remarkable Treble in unexceptional circumstances.",
      "It was also the first European Cup final to be moved back from a Wednesday to a Saturday, which remains one of the great first-world injustices of our time.",
      "",
      "29) 1993 – Marseille 1-0 Milan\nUEFA would perhaps rather the world forgot about the winner of its first revamped Champions League; the rest of the world would happily forget the final itself. Marseille reached it amid claims of corruption, bribery and much worse, while Milan boasted a side containing Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Gianluigi Lentini and Marco van Basten in his final game ever. They were kept at bay by Fabian Barthez, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli, who scored the only goal shortly before half-time.",
      "",
      "28) 1996 – Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 on penalties)\nA similarly sketchy final in hindsight again undeniably pitted the continent’s two best sides against one another, but the subsequent game was less than the sum of its numerous parts. Goalscorers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Jari Litmanen – both of whom capitalised on goalkeeping mistakes – would experience varying Premier League careers thereafter but even the former would struggle to conjure many memories besides his opener and lifting the trophy.",
      "",
      "27) 2021 – Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea\nWhile 19 points separated the two teams in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola helped bridge that chasm by turning his nose up at the idea of playing a holding midfielder. Thomas Tuchel welcomed the unexpected olive branch and a year after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat in the final with Paris Saint-Germain, the German engineered victory by the same scoreline thanks to Kai Havertz. But even Chelsea supporters would admit it was no classic.",
      "",
      "26) 2001 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 on penalties)\nThe all-penalty final saw Gaizka Mendieta and Steffan Effenberg trade spot-kicks in normal time, with Santiago Canizares saving from Mehmet Scholl, before Bayern triumphed in an eventual shootout. There were 28 shots so attacking football was not in particularly short order, but only goalkeeping fetishists would have truly enjoyed themselves.",
      "",
      "25) 2019 – Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool\nAn early goal can do one of two things to a match with such high stakes: galvanise the team that concedes and lead to a pulsating game; or encourage the scorers to become more defensive, resolute and frustrating as they seek to protect their advantage. The 2019 Champions League final was a prime example of the latter.",
      "Mo Salah put Liverpool in front in the second minute and while Tottenham were the better side thereafter, they never really recovered to the point where they threatened to equalise. Divock Origi provided the last slice of bread to a fairly mediocre sandwich just before the final whistle.",

      "",
      "24) 2022 – Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid\nThis final, moved to Paris from St Petersburg, is remembered most for the shambles which unfolded outside the Stade de France and the shameful cover-up that followed. On the pitch, it was the Thibaut Courtois final, with the Real Madrid keeper using his Mr Tickle arms to great effect, repelling everything Liverpool threw at him. After Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike, the belief slowly drained from the Reds with each stop Courtois made.",
      "",
      "23) 2000 – Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\nThat both finalists came from the same country for the first time in European Cup history did not help the first showpiece of the new millennium. Real Madrid actually finished lower than Valencia in La Liga – fifth to third – but the nature of the destruction gave it an air of a typical domestic meeting rather than the biggest match of the season. Steve McManaman’s volley was lovely, mind.",
      "",
      "22) 2023 – Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\nThe expectation was perhaps this would be a poor final because it was such a mis-match between the best team in Europe and the third-best team in Italy, but the reality was that Inter did an excellent job of disrupting City, who rarely got into their stride. Rodri scored a belter but City barely bothered the Italians otherwise, and they found Ederson to be a stubborn opponent themselves. The result was historic but few will remember the game.",
      "",
      "21) 2007 – Milan 2-1 Liverpool\nA final can sometimes suffer for its lack of freshness. Milan and Liverpool, of course, had the unenviable task of living up to their incredible clash of just two years prior; they never really stood a chance. The three goals were little more than ordinary and partial Dani Alves alternative Jermaine Pennant was probably the best player, for Christ’s sake.",
      "",
      "20) 2017 – Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid\nMario Mandzukic’s equaliser, one of the three greatest goals in Champions League final history, deserved so much more. Juventus were primed to deliver as much as late as the hour mark as they were still level, but they simply could not keep up as Real feigned to help The Old Lady cross the road before pushing them into onrushing traffic.",
      "",
      "19) 2009 – Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United\nThere goes that curse of the early goal again, the bane of many a neutral. Samuel Eto’o scored in the tenth minute and Lionel Messi the 70th as a ludicrous Barcelona side were just a level or two beyond Manchester United, who had just one shot on target in each half.",
      "",
      "18) 1998 – Juventus 0-1 Real Madrid\n“The 1998 Champions League final was possibly the most important game in Real Madrid’s history,” winning captain Manolo Sanchis once suggested, their 32-year wait to be crowned European champions finally coming to an end in Amsterdam. It was an incredible moment, but a fairly ordinary game.",

A total of 42 shots and 34 fouls made for a titanic tussle that Real eventually edged in a shootout.",

      "16) 2020 – PSG 0-1 Bayern Munich \nThe only final played behind closed doors when Covid was acting the d*** could have been a drab affair in the absence of fans but PSG and Bayern put on a decent spectacle in Lisbon. Both sides had good chances in the first half, with PSG desperate for their first European crown, but Bayern’s Champions League know-how told when Kingsley Coman headed in a winner on the hour before the Germans absorbed everything Mbappe and co. could throw at them.",
      "",
      "15) 2024 – Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Real Madrid\nAnother final in which the predicted procession did an immense disservice to the underdogs and exposed the favourites. Dortmund were as excellent as Real were poor in the first half and the Germans really should have led. Karim Adeyemi will forever be replaying that chance when put through on goal.",
      "But Real weathered that storm and their individual quality eventually told as Vinicius Junior carried them further into this era of dominance.",

      "14) 1995 – Ajax 1-0 Milan\nThe absolute state of those teams. Edwin van der Sar, Danny Blind, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Frank de Boer, Alessandro Costacurta, Clarence Seedorf, Marcel Desailly, Edgar Davids, Ronald de Boer, Zvonimir Boban, Jari Litmanen, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert.

Not that it wasn’t an excellent game: the continent’s best defence gave a supreme attack quite the scare before eventually succumbing to defeat.",
      "",
      "12) 2018 – Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\nStarved of possibly its best player after half an hour, the 2018 Champions League final did not provide quite the pulsating mesh of styles it had promised. Liverpool were understandably subdued and Real plodded through large portions before the rest was largely lost in a cloud of goalkeeping embarrassment.",
      "",
      "11) 2011 – Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United\nAs far as exhibitions go, they don’t come much better. But there was always a sense of Barcelona and Manchester United being a bit of a mismatch, even when Wayne Rooney equalised after half an hour.

      "10) 2012 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (3-4 on penalties)\nThe late drama of two goals in the final seven minutes went some way to undoing the relative monotony of the preceding 80 or so. It does, however, remain hilarious that Bayern Munich had 20 corners and failed to score from any, while Chelsea had only one and managed to rescue themselves with it.",
      "",
      "9) 2002 – Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid\nWere it not for an injury to starting goalkeeper Cesar, facilitating the introduction of Iker Casillas, an iconic moment in Champions League history might have been lost to the ether. As it was, Casillas made a string of impressive saves to preserve the lead Zinedine Zidane granted Los Blancos in spectacular fashion at Hampden Park. Few expected Leverkusen to make it so far but no-one could claim they didn’t contribute to a great game.",

      "8) 2006 – Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\nWhile an early sending-off can so often inhibit a team and a spectacle, Arsenal seemed invigorated by the dismissal of Jens Lehmann in Paris in 2006. They took the lead through Sol Campbell and were 15 minutes from unthinkable glory before Henrik Larsson rewrote the script as only he could.",

But there is a reason the Wikipedia summary of the first and second halves at the Nou Camp are offered as many paragraphs – three – as the entirety of injury-time.",

      "6) 2013 – Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich\nAfter their two Bundesliga meetings ended in 1-1 draws, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich did battle at Wembley to settle the matter beyond all doubt. Jurgen Klopp side started far better but fell behind after an hour, only to equalise eight minutes later. Arjen Robben then scored the winner in the penultimate minute to conclude an even and excellent game.",

      "5) 2014 – Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (after extra-time)\nWhen one team so obviously prepares for 90 minutes, the unexpected and sudden addition of 30 more can lead to something of a damp squib. Atletico Madrid led for almost an hour before Sergio Ramos’ last-gasp equaliser, at which point Diego Simeone’s side was drained both mentally and physically and bereft of substitutions. Extra-time was an exercise in brutality; it had become difficult to watch by the time Cristiano Ronaldo was baring his triumphant, flabby chest.",

      "3) 2008 – Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea\nSome continental meetings between two teams from the same nation suffer for familiarity. The 2008 Champions League final was the antidote to that particular poison, as Manchester United and Chelsea freely traded blows like super-heavyweights knowing this would be their defining bout. Cristiano Ronaldo landed the first blow, only to be floored by Frank Lampard. The dismissal of Didier Drogba in extra-time might even have inadvertently decided the destination of the cup, as John Terry slipped 12 yards from glory before Edwin van der Sar kept out Nicolas Anelka.",

      "2) 1997 – Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus\nThe biggest surprise in Champions League final history benefited from an unexpected winner toppling a European superpower, a two-goal salvo from the uncelebrated Karl-Heinz Riedle, an understated backheel goal from Alessandro Del Piero and one of the finest examples of man-marking in the sport’s history as Paul Lambert shadowed Zinedine Zidane throughout.

      "“It’s still Ten Hag’s team which was built for a different style, so now you’re seeing what happens when you play people out of position or in a system that many of them aren’t comfortable.",
      "“But my fear is whether he can make that formation work in any case. United have never played three at the back in their history, and apart from Inter, all the best teams in the world play with that back four.",
      "“With a lot of that current squad, we’re not talking about bad players. Some of these players earn a lot of money, and regardless of the formation, they have to be playing at a level higher than they are right now. To be fifth from the bottom is absolutely disastrous.",
      "“They put all their eggs in one basket in terms of winning the Europa League and that performance was absolutely pathetic. Fans can understand performances dropping in the weeks before the final, but you have to show up, and they were diabolical. So the jury still has to be out.”",
      "Ince has also hit out at Man Utd’s board as they should have been in the ‘race” to sign two Liverpool stars.",

      "Liam Delap choosing Chelsea is a massive blow for Manchester United – much more damaging than it would have been for the Blues had the 22-year-old snubbed them in favour of the Red Devils.",
      "Chelsea are an attractive club to play for right now; Manchester United are not. It’s not Delap or bust for Chelsea, but that feels very much the case for United.",
      "Delap was perfect: young; cheap; scores Premier League goals. And crucially, while United are terrible, they are definitely better than Ipswich.",
      "Not only do they not have European football as a draw, there’s also no light at the end of a tunnel which has grown longer under Ruben Amorim thanks to a philosophy and system almost laughably unsuited to the players in his squad. Any striker joining United this summer will wonder how long a contract might need to be for them to see a semblance of success at Old Trafford.",
      "History, a fading assumption that things must get better at Manchester United because This Is Manchester United and a promise of game time are about the only selling points Amorim and his recruitment team can use to lure players to the club this summer.",
      "That won’t be enough for Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike or other top-level goalscorers United would previously have been vying to sign, and our struggle to come up with these seven striker options – most of whom still feel like unlikely additions for various reasons – shows just how bleak things are for Amorim in the search for anyone who can put the ball in the back of the net.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nNaming United’s director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves along with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and sporting director Giovanni Manna in a report claiming a meeting has been held in Naples to discuss a swap deal for Osimhen adds a level of credence to a rumour we would otherwise have dismissed out of hand. Kudos to the reporter for their commitment to the clicks if it is indeed nonsense.",
      "Osimhen is a world-class striker who’s scored 36 goals on loan at Galatasaray this term and 100 goals in his last four seasons. He’s in that top rung of goalscorers currently available for transfer. And weirdly, despite being very available – Napoli are desperate to get rid of him with his contract expiring at the end of next season – there appears to be scant competition to sign him.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool have turned their noses up for some reason, Paris Saint-Germain are no longer keen and even Chelsea appear to have gone off the idea of signing a brilliant 26-year-old striker for £65m on £200,000-per-week wages. Sounds good to us.",
      "And amid reports that, unlike other top strikers, Osimhen isn’t all that bothered about Champions League football, we wonder if the Nigerian doesn’t have something of a chip on his shoulder…a burning desire to prove doubters wrong.",
      "He can find a kindred spirit in that pursuit at Old Trafford in Amorim, and we’re sure (actually we’re not, but we hope) Osimhen would rather be scoring Premier League goals, even for Manchester United, than Saudi Pro League goals for whichever PIF club offers him a billion pounds a year to play in front of tens of people.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nWe love him and really don’t want him, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton or anyone else to leave Palace ahead of their Europa League campaign as Oliver Glasner – having already won it once before with Frankfurt – could do something really rather special with this group if he can keep them together.",
      "Reports suggesting Mateta is open to a move as he looks to catch Didier Deschamps’ eye ahead of the World Cup in 2026 begs the question as to whether he’s more likely to do that by staying at Palace and playing in Europe or through moving to Old Trafford. We’re leaning towards the latter as for better or worse, Deschamps – like everyone else – will be very aware of what Mateta is doing if he becomes United’s new No.9.",
      "He could be great as well. He’s what Rasmus Hojlund should be – a bully who holds the ball up well with a decent touch, brings playmakers into the game, runs in behind and gets on the end of crosses. Another significant boon for Amorim is that Mateta has thrived for Palace in the 3-4-3 formation he is trying to make work at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nAnyone not watching Villa week in, week out, and actually a fair few who have, would claim this was something of a fallow season for Watkins. A fair point compared to last term perhaps, but a Premier League return of 16 goals and eight assists meant only four players – Mohamed Salah (47), Alexander Isak (29), Bryan Mbeumo (27) and Erling Haaland (25) – finished the campaign with more goal contributions than the 29-year-old, in what was his second-best top-flight season in that regard.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team made a point of not wanting to sign players over the age of 25 when they took charge of football operations, in a bid to ensure their market values at least had a chance of increasing in their time at the club, rather than fading to nothing as has been the case for pretty much everyone signed in the last decade.",
      "The England international would have to hit the ground running and score goals at a fair lick to avoid his value dropping as he turns 30 in December, but needs must and United just need to find someone, anyone who can lead the line – as Watkins has done very, very well for Villa under Unai Emery – and score goals.",
      "",
      "Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen)\nHis age (29) is about the only stick you can beat Schick with given his schtick this season has been scoring more Bundesliga goals (21) than anyone but Serhou Guirassy (also 21) and Harry Kane (26).",
      "Reports suggest Bayer Leverkusen would be open to bids of around £30m for a striker who could probably be tempted by a move to any Premier League team – with or without European football – such is his long-held desire to play in the English top flight.",
      "Meanwhile, Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko, who have been linked with the top-tier clubs looking for strikers this summer, have both had £80m-£100m price tags slapped on them despite scoring 15 and 13 Bundesliga goals respectively.",
      "Schick would be a relatively low risk, cheap option for United.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nTalking of risk, Nkunku might just be the most perilous option. He’s done nothing at Chelsea to suggest he’s got what it takes to be a Premier League footballer. He’s done plenty to suggest he’s not cut out for it. And yet… he is a very talented footballer – ‘there’s a player in there’ as they say.",
      "But while that player could perhaps be uncovered at Liverpool or another stable football club, Manchester United are not in a position to be lifting a footballer from a slump, while a move to Old Trafford will almost certainly see Nkunku scrabbling on his hands and knees at the cloying soil at the base of the hole he finds himself to find the rocks at the very bottom.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean (Fiorentina)\nHis signing is unlikely to be widely heralded by the United fanbase on the basis of a Premier League career which saw him score just four goals in 39 appearances for Everton having been seen as quite the transfer coup when Marco Silva persuaded him to join from Juventus in 2019. He was only a kid at the time though and has developed his game in the meantime to become a far more rounded striker.",
      "Kean scored 19 Serie A goals this season, behind on Mateo Retegui (25), including braces against Roma and Inter, and goals against Juventus, Atalanta and AC Milan.",
      "He has a €52m [£44m] release clause, which feels reasonable, and may well feel as though he has unfinished business in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "We won’t profess to have seen Burkardt in action enough to make a claim over his suitability to United in terms of style, but everything about a move for him feels pretty perfect besides an eye test which we’re 100% sure would lead us to insist he’s a better bet than Hojlund.",
      "He’s 24, a Germany international, has frequently played in a 3-4-3 and has a release clause of just €20m [£17m]. The not insignificant issue for United is that Frankfurt have supposedly made Burkardt their top target if Ekitike gets poached by one of the big boys, and they can offer him Champions League football. But United should absolutely be looking into this one at the very least.",
      "Man Utd director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves has flown to Italy for a ‘meeting’ with Napoli owner De Laurentiis over a potential swap deal this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their preferred striker signing after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could now ‘quit’ the Red Devils as his potential future takes yet another U-turn, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have had a terrible season in the Premier League with Ruben Amorim’s side finishing the campaign in 15th position after a final day win over Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim has failed to improve performances or results since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November and now there are set to be big changes in the summer.",
      "Man Utd had a huge chance to put this season behind them when they faced Tottenham in the Europa League final earlier this month – but Spurs triumphed as Ange Postecoglou’s side booked their place in the Champions League for next season.",
      "The money would have been very welcome at Old Trafford with rumours that Man Utd could have to sell a number of their better players in order to facilitate the transfer window they want.",
      "Fernandes is one of the only players that a majority of supporters would want the club to keep in the summer transfer window but the riches on offer from Saudi Arabia could be too much.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘at bottom of a six foot hole’ but Bruno still surely unsellable",
      "Speaking on his future after losing the Europa League final, Fernandes said: “I have always been honest. I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go.",
      "“I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "“If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.”",
      "Rumours of an exit to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have continued in recent days with a claim on Thursday that they will make a £100m bid if Fernandes accepts their offer to effectively quadruple his wages.",
      "And, in a fresh report, The Times have claimed that Fernandes ‘may quit’ after ‘positive talks’ with the Saudi Arabia side this week.",
      "The Portugal international is now ‘giving serious thought to quitting’ Man Utd after ‘his agent held positive talks with Al-Hilal over a deal that could end up earning him around £700,000 per week’.",
      "Fernandes ‘has been mulling over a proposal from the Saudi Pro League club this week’ and Al-Hilal ‘want Fernandes to decide his future over the weekend as they would like the Portuguese to play for them in the Club World Cup, which begins on June 14’.",
      "Former Chelsea and Aston Villa forward Tony Cascarino reckons Man Utd should take £100m if Al-Hilal are willing to pay that for 30-year-old Fernandes.",
      "Cascarino told talkSPORT earlier this week: “I would snap their hand off. It’s time for a number of big decisions to be made and he’s one of them. If they’re getting offered £100m for a 30-year-old, you take it. You absolutely take it.",
      "“It’s money that you’ve got to use very wisely on people that you’ve identified to bring in. I’d take it immediately.",
      "“If that was the offer, I think Man United would even have to push him a bit [towards the move] and say ‘we’re looking in a different direction now’.”",
      "Manchester United are in something of a mess and it could end in bankruptcy. But should they sell Bruno Fernandes?",
      "According to reports, there has been an ‘intriguing twist’ in the race to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, with Al-Hilal ‘ready to pay’.",
      "Manchester United have been treading on rakes in the transfer market for a decade now; selling Bruno Fernandes would be the most catastrophic mis-step yet.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been given a deadline by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal after making him a ‘final contract offer’, according to reports.",

      "According to reports, new Bayer Leverkusen head coach Erik ten Hag is plotting a raid on former club Manchester United as he looks to replace Florian Wirtz.",
      "Man Utd sacked Ten Hag following a miserable start to this season after being fortunate to keep his job following their eighth-place finish in 2023/24.",
      "Ten Hag‘s success in cup competitions saved him last summer after the Red Devils beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup, but poor performances in the Premier League continued as the Dutchman’s position became untenable towards the end of last year.",
      "The former Ajax boss had a break for around six months before announcing his return to management with Bundesliga outfit Bayer Leverkusen to replace Real Madrid’s Xabi Alonso.",
      "Ten Hag is facing a difficult summer as several important players are likely to follow Alonso in leaving Leverkusen, with Liverpool-bound Wirtz set to be the biggest loss.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘at bottom of a six foot hole’ but Bruno still surely unsellable",
      "Wirtz will leave a huge void at Bayer Leverkusen and he will not be easy to replace, but German outlet Kicker claims they are already considering potential candidates.",
      "Lyon standout Rayan Cherki, linked with Man City and Man Utd, is deemed an ‘unrealistic’ option, but two Red Devils stars are their other targets.",
      "Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho is reportedly their ‘absolute top option’ to replace Wirtz and he could be a gettable target with the £59m star recently told to ‘find a new club’.",
      "Leverkusen face competition for Garnacho after Chelsea and Napoli were linked with him in January, so they could be forced to look at alternatives and Antony is a ‘tempting’ option.",
      "The links with Antony are hardly surprising as the Brazil international was handpicked by Ten Hag ahead of his first season at Man Utd, who massively overpaid when they landed him for around £86m from Ajax.",
      "Antony proved a major flop at Man Utd and while he has returned to form during his loan spell at Real Betis, he went missing in the Europa Conference League final defeat to Chelsea.",
      "Still, Man Utd are expected to cut their losses on Antony this summer and they should attract offers in the region of £40m.",
      "The report indicates that a move for Antony is more likely than for Garnacho:",
      "‘Antony is tempting and the same applies to Garnacho, whom coach Ruben Amorim recently strongly suggested should be transferred internally.",
      "‘The right-footer would be an absolute top option and is said to be in the very reasonable range in terms of salary. The Argentinian, who is also said to be interested in Milan and Napoli, also falls into the not yet available category.’",
      "Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has revealed the feeling in the Red Devils squad after reports that Ruben Amorim essentially told Alejandro Garnacho his career there was over.",
      "Man Utd were given some clarity over Jadon Sancho’s future by Enzo Maresca after the winger’s goal helped Chelsea to win the Europa Conference League.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a ‘brutal message’ to Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been ‘kicked out’.",
      "It may well have been the worst season in Man Utd history but it’s been a bloody good one in general for the fortunate few who have escaped Old Trafford…",
      "Man Utd winger Antony has opened up on his personal struggles and difficult times at Old Trafford ahead of Real Betis’ Europa Conference League final.",
      "Man Utd are willing to offer a ‘compromise’ to Napoli as they look to conclude a ‘quick’ deal for Alejandro Garnacho’s exit, according to reports."

      "However, the lack of European football next year means United are at the bottom of a six foot hole waiting for the dirt to be piled on. Two seasons out of European football and we might actually see United go bankrupt. Summer will be a rough time, gamble and let Amorim spend in the hope they’ll make the Champions League and keep the wolves at bay but also ensure the death of the club if they don’t.",

      "United are about to sign Cunha. He has 15 goals and six assists last season v Bruno’s 8 goals and 11 assists. Cunha played 3 fewer games. So Cunha could replace Bruno’s attacking output, at least in terms of goal involvements, if not in terms of creating chances for our non-existent strikers.",
      "There is also an argument that United would be better without Bruno because he gives the ball away so much. This could be said to have cost us in the Europa League final in which he was otherwise anonymous (despite getting a Whoscored rating of 7.39). I always think he’s United’s Steven Gerrard but is he in fact our Coutinho?",
      "Selling Bruno would provide significant funds – not selling for less than £100M, which would be almost pure profit – which we could invest wisely in 2/3 young players for big needs within the squad.",
      "Now, having said all that with a straight face, United should not entertain Bruno’s sale this summer (unless silly money is offered – £150M plus) for three reasons:",
      "1) Hes our best player and one of only four players in their prime we can rely (possibly five with Cunha coming in)",
      "2) There’s no guarantee anyone will replace his contribution – even Cunha is outscoring his xG massively already so a regression to the mean will mean a drop in his output.",
      "3) I don’t trust United to replace him",
      "Bruno plus Cunha means United score more goals next year, even without a striker. No Bruno leaves us where we are with no guarantee that anyone in the team is going to replace his output. We wouldn’t even be able to spend the money on the quality of player that could guarantee replacing his output because they all want to play in the Champions League and not for a team that trades on its history rather than the quality on the pitch.",

      "That leaves S. America, which was never going to be likely, Africa (no money in it), and the Far East, which is where they are. The club needs all the income it can get, and also playing at home in August will help with this.",
      "As an aside, I now live in the Far East and the people are pissed. A chance to see their team and that’s what gets served up. It won’t mean anything to the club, but fans (those who did attend – it was half full in KL) have saved up for this for months, so you can imagine that being beaten by a team that technically does not exist is far from amusing for them.",

Not to be snide but I think this may be because it was extremely long and I’m not sure rival fans bothered reading it all the way through. I’m a Liverpool fan but even I found parts of it to be utterly preposterous, though.",
      "To his great credit, Ed rightly acknowledges the great job FSG has done in running the club, and admits he had been wrong about them previously, specifically about “completely throwing all the good work away with pointless penny pinching” in 2019-2021 when LFC was on top.",
      "To his great discredit, Ed has decided to somehow repeat this mistake like-for-like, and is now trying to convince himself that this moment is “a near unique opportunity” to “start a dynasty” and “rival even the Real Madrids of this world”. It’s a baffling lack of perspective/awareness from someone who began by acknowledging a previous lack of perspective/awareness.",
      "FSG have owned and operated the club for 15 years now. They have an established track record of making excellent, if financially conservative, decisions. They have stated repeatedly from the beginning in 2010 that they would operate the club within its own means, and that they would always reinvest any money generated by the club into itself. They have lived up to this promise and delivered more than I had ever dared hope Liverpool would achieve in a football landscape competing with the likes of City/Chelsea/PSG/Newcastle/Chinese-clubs-10-years-ago/Saudi-clubs-2-years-ago. They brought in Suarez, they brought in Allison and Virgil, they offered 120m for Felipe Caicedo, they are working on major deals this summer.",
      "FSG does not reinvest the club’s money into itself each and every year, though; the money is sometimes rolled over to future windows, and this upsets a lot of fans. These fans have either missed the fact that LFC has won two league titles in 35 years and both came in seasons when the club did basically nothing in the transfer window, or they simply care more about transfers than they do about effective football club management, who knows.",
      "It was always a mistake to interpret FSG’s general fiscal conservatism as a lack of ambition from club management/ownership, or as a sign of greed/them taking money out of the club. But it is also a mistake to interpret FSG loosening the purse strings for opportunistic luxury purchases like Suarez/Allison/Caicedo/Wirtz as the start of an era of Scouse Galacticos, rather than exceptions to the rule/approach which has served LFC so well over the last 15 years and will hopefully continue to see us with a club that we can be wholly proud to support.\nOliver (sidenote: if City’s FFP/PSR charges are confirmed, we could have already been talking about an FSG-led LFC dynasty in English football) Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland",

      "Why the fuss over Chelsea?\nThere seems to be a big deal being made of the fact that Chelsea have become the first English club to win all 3 ‘major’ European trophies.",
      "The Europa Conference League final has only been played 4 times and I suspect that any ambitious team will still be aiming for the Champions League and would see even a drop into the Europa League as a failure, rather than aiming to match Chelsea’s majestic European treble.",
      "Chelsea were not in the Conference League because they qualified for the Europa League but Man Utd winning the FA Cup put them in there instead, but they did put themselves in a position to qualify for the Europa League and were then shifted to the Conference League due to Utd’s FA Cup win because ‘them’s the rules’.",
      "Having said all that, I would love Arsenal to win any European trophy as it might shut Stewie Griffin up (it wouldn’t) and although, unlike some ‘supporters, I don’t see winning trophies as the be all and end all (it is possible to just enjoy football for the game that it is) it is very enjoyable.",

      "Firstly, let’s look at Arsenal. Three consecutive years (four, if you count the collapsed bid for Champions League football in 2022) of coming up short with largely the same group of players. This season has given us strong hints it is starting to take its toll.",
      "If they couldn’t deal with the pressure of the last few years, how is it going to be in this coming season – the 5th proper year of the Arteta project – where the expectations now shift from HOPING to EXPECTING to win a trophy? They’ll probably get that striker they need, but it won’t be the cure for all ills. They still lack squad depth. They still lack knowhow at the business end of the season. And Arteta doesn’t help with his paranoia and touchline histrionics.",
      "No, for me, this feels like a club coming to the end game of a project, not the start. Liverpool and Man City will definitely finish above them next year.",
      "And so, to Chelsea. Back in the Champions League, and with that winning feeling from bagging the Conference League. And now, this afternoon, news is coming through they’re grabbing Delap from under the noses of Manchester United (lol, by the way) which surely represents an upgrade on the erratic Jackson.",
      "If they can now get a decent goalkeeper and a dominant centre back to supplement the quality of James, Cucurella, Enzo, Caicedo, Lavia, Palmer and (presumably) Delap, then you’re looking at a side that can surely only be heading in one direction and that is upwards. It’s easy to scoff at Chelsea these last few years – and a lot of it has been entirely justified – but you just get a feeling that something might just be starting to take off at long last.",
      "Please feel free to chuck this back in my face if Arsenal are 10 points clear at Christmas and Chelsea are looking like they fancy a return to Conference League football – but I’m confident that you’ll see a changing of the guard in London next season.\nAndy H, Swansea",

In recent seasons the Dodgers have been very very good, and last season (not counting the COVID season of 2020, run on very different lines), they won their first World Series in 36 years. I was thrilled. It felt great.",
      "Well, it’s an American tradition for champion sports teams to visit the White House for a ceremony with the President. Without the slightest peep of dissent, the Dodgers went to the White House and gave Donald Trump a personalized replica jersey.",

I’ve switched my allegiance to the Chicago White Sox, a team that is unlikely to win a World Series in the rest of my lifetime, and right now is pretty bad.

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Jamie Gittens, Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and is on Arsenal’s shortlist. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Rayan Cherki (Lyon)\nCherki’s best position is still up for debate, but his ability to play anywhere across the front line makes him extremely appealing.",
      "His numbers this season were brilliant: 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances, with 11 assists and 8 goals in Ligue 1 alone. He’s up there for key passes too, with 75 across the top five leagues.",
      "He’s already waved goodbye to Lyon fans, and the club desperately need a big sale. While some reports claimed a release clause of £18.9m, David Ornstein shut that down, confirming there isn’t one and that Lyon will want a much bigger fee.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are interested, and Manchester City are sniffing around as they prepare for life after Kevin De Bruyne – who will reportedly join Napoli on a free.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked.",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",

      "It is noted that ‘the fact his representative travelled to Riyadh is an intriguing twist’, especially considering ‘talks at the Four Seasons hotel are believed to have continued late into the night’.",
      "The report also revealed the overall package could be worth around £300m.",

      "A report from Football Insider claims Man Utd are ‘to accept’ £80-100m offers for Fernandes, with former Premier League scout Mick Brown explaining why it would be “difficult to say no” to these proposals.",

      "Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing and upsetting; Antony has been on loan at Real Betis from Manchester United since January; Brazilian winger faces Chelsea on Wednesday in the Conference League final;",
      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",
      "\"I even get emotional because it was very difficult for me. Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",
      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
