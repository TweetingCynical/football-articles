      "West Brom are eyeing up Minnesota United head coach Eric Ramsay as their next head coach with the ex-Manchester United assistant poised for a return to England.",
      "The 34-year-old has spent the last two seasons with the MLS outfit, leading the club into the play-offs on both occasions, which has seen his reputation rise and now those making the decisions at the Hawthorns are ready to move, reports ESPN.",
      "Mason only moved to West Brom in the summer following years at Tottenham but lasted just over six months. The loss at Leicester in midweek proved to be his last act and, after six losses in eight games, he was given his marching orders with the Baggies down in 18th.",
      "Ramsay has long been well regarded in England, largely due to his work in Manchester. He arrived at Carrington as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's final recruit as manager and retained his role through the tenures that saw Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag at the helm.",
      "Alongside that he also served the Wales men's national team as an assistant coach for six months, beginning in March 2023. He previously worked at youth level for the likes of Swansea City, Shrewsbury Town and Chelsea.",
      "His quality has been evident to those he's worked under with Ten Hag among those to publicly praise Ramsay and backed him to have a positive future in the dugout, especially when he expanded his experience when he had a stint on the international scene.",
      "The Dutchman told the club's website in 2023: “Eric is a really talented coach, and he is progressing a lot. He is ambitious and this will happen, and it will improve him and help him to get new experiences, but also it will improve Manchester United as he will bring experiences back in our coaching.”",
      "A number of men who have served as assistants at Old Trafford in recent years have gone on to enjoy successful stints in the dugout. Michael Carrick, who has been linked with an interim return to Manchester, took charge of Middlesbrough and led them to the Championship play-offs.",
      "Kieran McKenna went even better and took charge of Ipswich when they were in League One. He secured successive promotions for the Tractor Boys as they rose up to the Premier League for the first time in more than two decades. He again has them in the hunt for promotion after last year's relegation.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Despite his abrupt dismissal from Manchester United in 2022, it's reported that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen on a return to Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday, leading the club's top brass to appoint Darren Fletcher as interim manager while they evaluate potential permanent replacements.",
      "However, the Norwegian could be in line to take the reins temporarily until the season's end, a role Solskjaer is reportedly eager to fill. While some might argue that bringing back the Baby Faced Assassin is a step in the wrong direction, there's no denying the affection Solskjaer holds for the club and continues to receive from supporters.",
      "A six-month stint at Old Trafford could see Solskjaer tasked with stabilising the team ahead of a new manager's arrival in the summer. However, with United vying for Champions League qualification and the FA Cup resuming this weekend, it could offer him a chance to leave his mark during his second tenure.",
      "Despite his sacking, Solskjaer remained a popular figure in the United dressing room, with his influence still very much felt. The 52-year-old could still make a significant impact, particularly if he decides to focus on two key areas, should he land the top job once more.",
      "Having spent 11 years playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, it's hardly surprising that Solskjaer is a staunch advocate of nurturing young talent, a fundamental part of United's ethos as a football club.",
      "Their youth record continues to astound fans to this day as the club have remarkably featured an academy graduate in every single first-team matchday squad since October 30, 1937. This streak has surpassed 4,000 consecutive games, a tradition Solskjaer upheld during his tenure.",
      "Solskjaer gave 16 club youngsters their first-team debuts, including Amad and Anthony Elanga. Amorim also handed debuts to Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey this season, providing a clear pathway for the youth to the first team, a key aspect of both Solskjaer and United's identity.",
      "Arguably, Man United's only overwhelmingly successful transfer since Ferguson's retirement in 2013 is Bruno Fernandes, who has been a game-changer since his arrival in 2020. With 309 appearances in the red shirt, he's netted 103 goals and provided 94 assists.",
      "While these impressive stats haven't translated into significant success, United fans would shudder to think where they would be without their Portuguese captain. That was a scenario that almost became a reality last summer when Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal reportedly tabled a £100million offer for the 31-year-old, which was turned down.",
      "In a recent interview, Fernandes confessed that he has contemplated leaving United and was upset by reports suggesting the club were willing to let him go. With Amorim's exit, Fernandes has now served under three permanent managers, and Solskjaer - the gaffer who brought Fernandes to Old Trafford - may have his work cut out persuading the captain not to pursue a lucrative move to the Middle East.",
      "Fernandes might be pleased with the return of his former manager, as he previously cited Solskjaer's faith in him as a key reason for joining the club. A challenging task could lie ahead for the ex-striker if Fernandes is considering a move away this summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ralf Rangnick heaped praise on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he first took the reins at Old Trafford. The Manchester United icon is among the contenders for the current vacancy and is favourite with the bookmakers to land a second spell as manager.",
      "Ruben Amorim got his marching orders on Monday after speaking out against his United bosses following the team's stalemate with Leeds last weekend. Darren Fletcher has temporarily stepped into the dugout, steering the side to a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday evening.",
      "United are planning to bring in a manager for the remainder of the season before hunting for a permanent replacement for Amorim. Solskjaer, who previously managed the club for nearly three years until November 2021, is one of several coaches who have held talks over the position.",
      "The 52-year-old found himself in an identical scenario back in December 2018. The club legend was installed as caretaker manager after Jose Mourinho's departure before being handed the job on a permanent basis three months later.",
      "During his tenure, Solskjaer guided United to sixth, third and second place finishes in the Premier League, while also losing the 2021 Europa League final. Following his exit later that year, Solskjaer had a conversation with incoming interim boss Rangnick, who spoke highly of the former United forward.",
      "\"I spoke with Ole last Sunday before the game against Chelsea for almost two hours,\" Rangnick said after joining the club. \"He was very generous to spend, as I said, [more than] one-and-a-half hours on the phone with me, telling all his inside details about the team.\"",
      "Rangnick's tenure saw him win just 11 of his 29 matches in charge, with plans for him to move into a consultancy position ultimately abandoned. In contrast, Solskjaer had thrived as interim manager, securing 14 victories from 19 fixtures before being handed the role on a permanent basis.",
      "United are hoping their next appointment will spark a similar revival, having held discussions with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy regarding the position. When questioned in September 2024, Solskjaer had previously indicated he would be willing to return to the club.",
      "During a Q&A session at the Oslo Business Forum, the 52-year-old said: \"If the family [United] asks, I would say yes every day of the week. It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people [Erik ten Hag] have now, but I would say yes, of course.\"",
      "Following his departure from United, Solskjaer took a prolonged break from coaching. He was appointed Besiktas manager in January 2025 but was dismissed in August following a Europa Conference League play-off defeat to Swiss outfit Lausanne- Sport.",
      "Meanwhile, interim boss Fletcher will be looking to make his mark this weekend as the club prepare to take on Brighton in the FA Cup. The 41-year-old, who consulted Sir Alex Ferguson before accepting the position, will oversee his first match at Old Trafford on Sunday as the club seek to progress in the cup.",
      "In his first press conference as manager, Fletcher stated: \"I don't like to make any major decisions or things without speaking to Sir Alex and that's something I've done since I've been at the club and since I've left the club and everything I do.",
      "\"I've got a really good relationship with Sir Alex so he's probably the first person on the phone actually so I wanted to speak to him first. And ultimately, to get his blessing, to be perfectly honest with you, I think he deserves that respect.",
      "\"I wanted to run it by him, what he thought and he was supportive of it and he echoed my thoughts which I've always said. It's your job to do the best for Manchester United when you're an employee of the club. It's amazing when he says something that I try and live and believe every day, so it was comforting for me for him to say that.\"",

Ineos-owned Lausanne already have Enzo Kana-Biyik on loan from United, and they could be looking to add Kone to their ranks for the rest of the campaign.",
      "Kone suffered a sickening eye socket fracture while playing for the Under-21s against Tamworth in August. He was sidelined for several months before making his return to the academy in November.",
      "The midfielder played a full match for the U21s against Borussia Dortmund at Old Trafford just before Christmas, setting him up for a potential loan move in the January transfer window. Kone has jetted off to Switzerland to train with Ineos-owned Lausanne ahead of a possible loan for the second half of the season.",
      "He is spending time with Lausanne to determine if the deal would be beneficial for both parties.",
      "Lausanne's manager, Peter Zeidler, recently told reporters: \"Yes, he's been with us for a few days, we know he's a good player and we've been watching him closely. He'll play with us on Thursday.",
      "\"He's with us, we can observe him closely, and we'll make a decision, just like we did last summer with Enzo Kana-Biyik, a very good young player who improved a lot in just a few months with us despite his early-season injury, and who also belongs to Manchester United.",
      "\"We saw his quality, particularly with his assist against Fiorentina. We have good experience with Enzo, so why not with Sekou Kone? But to say today whether he'll come, I don't know. It depends on several factors; we'll decide between January 15th and February 15th, as with all players.\"",
      "Kana-Biyik quietly joined Manchester during the summer transfer window, arriving on a free from French side Le Havre before heading straight out on a season-long loan to Lausanne.",
      "Kone would become the second United player sent on loan to Ineos-owned Lausanne should the switch get the go-ahead.",
      "Ruben Amorim included Kone in three Premier League matchday squads last term - for fixtures against Tottenham, Everton and Nottingham Forest - but the teenager is yet to make his first-team bow.",
      "The 19-year-old then jetted off to the USA for pre-season training, though he failed to feature in any matches.",

He has his critics, but I like what he's done at Newcastle. He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.",

      "It appears that United are set to appoint an interim option for the time being, with former players Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher and Ruud van Nistelrooy all having emerged as potential options.",
      "But should they choose to go in a different direction, it appears that Xavi would be open to a move to Old Trafford. According to reports in Spain, the former midfielder is ready to return to management, having been out of work since May 2024.",
      "He is also keen on a switch to the Premier League, having only managed in Qatar and Spain. Xavi himself confirmed his desire to one day find a job in England.",
      "Speaking last year, he said: \"Of course? Where, I don't know. There's no hurry for me, but I'd like a good project. Like, 'You have four years to work and make a project.' I'd love to work in the Premier League because I love the passion there. In Spain, it's too much about the result.",
      "\"Or a national team, that would appeal. When I dreamed about being a coach, I dreamed about being in a World Cup or European Championship.”",
      "As it stands, United have had no contact with Xavi regarding a potential appointment but he could potentially become an option in the future. The 45-year-old kicked off his managerial career with Qatari side Al Sadd and was then appointed by former club Barcelona in November 2021.",
      "He went on to manage 142 games at the Camp Nou, winning the 2022/23 La Liga title to add to the eight league titles, three Spanish cups and four Champions League crowns he won as a player during his time with Barcelona.",

      "Michael Owen believes there are two glaring reasons why Zinedine Zidane won't ever manage Manchester United. The Frenchman has been linked with the job after Ruben Amorim's dismissal.",
      "After just 14 months in charge, Portuguese head coach Amorim was shown the exit this week on the back of an explosive press conference. Darren Fletcher has taken up the reins in the interim and his team drew 2-2 with Burnley on Wednesday night.",
      "The reported plan is to bring in a caretaker manager until the end of this current season before finding a long-term replacement in the summer. Former Real Madrid boss Zidane's name was mentioned before when United needed a new head coach and he has now been linked with the position again.",
      "But Owen, who was Zidane's team-mate at the Bernabeu, feels that the lifestyle he would be offered in Manchester, accompanied by a language barrier, means that the Frenchman is unlikely to ever sit in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "\"His English is probably about as good as my Spanish! So I just don't see it. He's obviously done the Real Madrid thing. He's been exceptionally successful. I see the French national job as something that he might turn to. I just don't see it with United.",
      "\"I don't think you can be Manchester United manager and hardly speak a word of English. As a player, wonderful. As a manager, obviously he's won the biggest prizes. There's nothing to answer in terms of his CV. One of the great players, one of the great managers. I just think with the language barrier and the lifestyle, I don't see it.\"",
      "Zidane became an icon on the pitch for Los Blancos before he guided them to three Champions League titles as head coach. But Owen says he was quite a reserved figure in the Real Madrid dressing room and he never foresaw him as a manager.",
      "\"He was quite quiet I would say,\" Owen added. \"I didn't necessarily think that he would go into management. In many ways, obviously management is for him, but I don't think he's hung up on management.",
      "\"I think it's a give or take type of thing. If he's not managing a great team with great players and has a chance of winning something big, can he be a***d?",
      "\"But he was quite quiet, quite studious. When he spoke, you listened, but he wouldn't shout or anything like that in the dressing room. He would take things in and he would sit in the corner and look at everyone.",
      "\"He wasn't Ronaldo or Roberto Carlos who were the laughers and the jokers and the loud ones. He would sit there and take a lot in. He was a nice guy and very respectful and kind.",
      "\"I didn't have him down as that leader. Obviously on the pitch, yes, but not in terms of rousing the troops and shouting and things like that. He was more studious and quiet.\"",

      "It's been a busy week for Manchester United, who are balancing finding a new head coach with scouting the January transfer window after sacking Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese tactician was given his walking papers on Monday morning, with the Red Devils citing that the decision was made to give the club the \"best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher took the reins as interim head coach for United's league tie with Burnley on Wednesday, but considering the game finished in a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor, the board may be looking for someone a little more seasoned to take control until season's end, when they will properly assess their options.",
      "Both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have been linked with taking up a temporary position until May, with the club set to hold talks with both men this week. Whichever man is chosen for the task at hand may be offered the opportunity to reinforce the first-team this month.",
      "Scott McTominay has been linked with a sensational return to the north west after thriving in Napoli. The Scot joined the Serie A outfit in 2024, and helped Gli Azzurri clinch the league title in his maiden season.",
      "However, should Solskjaer be given the interim head coaching role at Old Trafford, he could advocate for the Red Devils to go back in for their academy graduate. Speaking about the midfielder in 2019, Solskjaer said: \"He's been excellent, and now that him and Fred work in a good relationship, work well together [sic] did that last season, PSG, when we had a few injuries and now as well they are working as a pair.",
      "\"Scotty's a leader, a Manchester United boy, you can see he's been a striker with the goal at Norwich on a half turn, but he's developing into a very good midfielder.\"",
      "It's clear that United are lacking in midfield at present, with Bruno Fernandes dropping into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro, whose future at the club beyond the current campaign is unknown. Elsewhere, Kobbie Mainoo has seen his game time limited as of late, while Manuel Ugarte looks to be nearing the exit.",
      "With all that in mind, McTominay could certainly be the exact player that the Premier League giants are lacking at present,. And with Solskjaer potentially at the wheel once again, it could certainly tempt the 29-year-old back to the club where he made a name for himself given their relationship.",
      "As per reports, Ajax have set their sights on snapping up Ugarte this month. A report from Dutch publication VI suggests that the Uruguayan is open to the idea of a move to the Eredivisie sensations after failing to make much of a mark in the Premier League.",
      "A loan deal looks the most viable option on Ajax's side until the end of the season, albeit, his reported weekly wage of £120,000 could prove problematic. It could also cause United to negotiate on the percentage of the salary which Ajax would be prepared to cover.",
      "Since making his way to Old Trafford from PSG in a £42.1million move in 2024, Ugarte has made 61 appearances across all competitions for Manchester United to date.",
      "As a result of impressing in Brazil, Manchester United are among a number of clubs who have been linked with 20-year-old midfielder, Breno Bidon. It is reported that Corinthians value the talent at around £26m this winter - a fee which could be alluring to the Red Devils considering their current woes in the engine room.",
      "However, securing the centre-mid may be far from smooth sailing for United, considering Arsenal and Sporting CP have also been linked with him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has voiced his anger on social media following his disallowed goal during Napoli's 2-2 stalemate with Hellas Verona on Wednesday. The Manchester United loanee found the net with a stretched finish, but the strike was overturned after replays appeared to show the ball making contact with his arm during the build-up.",
      "Expressing his disappointment on Instagram, Hojlund posted clips of the controversial moment and commented: \"Didn't even touch the ball with the hand. Well, we go again on Sunday. Forza Napoli sempre,\" accompanied by a blue love heart and prayer emojis.",
      "Following the match, Antonio Conte voiced his exasperation, stating: \"Hojlund's goal was disallowed because I don't know where he should have had that arm. We have to accept them and we accept them.\"",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport have reported that referee Simone Sozza and the VAR team have subsequently been suspended, despite the match decisions being 'deemed correct.'",
      "Napoli found themselves trailing 2-0 at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona before Scott McTominay reduced the deficit, with Giovanni Di Lorenzo ultimately salvaging a point in the 82nd minute.",
      "McTominay broke his longest Serie A scoring drought, a nine-match barren spell since arriving at Napoli in 2024, earning him the Man of the Match accolade.",
      "Conte acknowledged his team's underwhelming first-half display, whilst commending their resilience as the match unfolded.",
      "\"In the first half there were two negative episodes for us, we could have done better,\" the Italian manager added. \"On the penalty there was a somewhat peculiar assessment... But we accept it.",
      "\"These two episodes could kill anyone. In the second half we were good at putting our heads on our shoulders.",
      "\"We had the strength to score two goals, and that's what counts.\"",
      "Hojlund has netted six times and provided two assists in 14 Serie A outings this campaign, though he couldn't add to his tally on this occasion after having a goal disallowed.",
      "Napoli possess a €50million (£43.6m) option to make the transfer permanent when the loan concludes, which becomes mandatory if they secure Champions League qualification this season.",
      "Nevertheless, all signs point to Hojlund making the switch permanent irrespective of circumstances.",

      "Manchester United supporters' group The 1958 have slammed the club's owners, chief executive Omar Berrarda and director of football Jason Wilcox, calling for a vote of no confidence. The group have announced plans for a protest against the United hierarchy that will take place before their fixture with Fulham on February 1.",
      "The group have criticised the management of Ruben Amorim's spell at Old Trafford, describing on-pitch performances as \"medicore\" and off-field operations as \"chaos\". Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been labelled an \"incompetent clown\" after his unsuccessful attempts to guide the club towards improvement.",
      "Amorim was dismissed by United on Monday, just hours after his furious comments following their 1-1 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road. Darren Fletcher has assumed control on an interim basis and managed the clash against Burnley, which ended 2-2, and will be in the dugout for the FA Cup third round match against Premier League opponents, Brighton.",
      "The protest adds further pressure on the Glazer family, Ratcliffe, and the revamped footballing operations team at the Theatre of Dreams. There is frustration amongst the supporters who believe they have been priced out, sidelined and treated as a nuisance.",
      "Supporters staged a demonstration at the conclusion of last season, ahead of the crucial fixture with Aston Villa, uniting to express their dissatisfaction with the football club following one of their most dismal campaigns in top-flight history",
      "They finished 15th in the Premier League and suffered defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Plans were initially in place to protest United's Premier League curtain-raiser against Arsenal, but these were abandoned following backlash over the decision to target Ratcliffe alongside the Glazers' stewardship of the club.",
      "Having postponed their demonstrations against the INEOS chief, next month's encounter with Marco Silva's outfit will mark the first chance for fans to express their discontent. Statements opposing the board have already started to surface, including during Wednesday's 2-2 stalemate at Turf Moor, where a banner was displayed in the away section declaring: \"Jim can't fix this.\"",
      "United are positioned just beyond the Champions League spots but squandered another chance to secure a top-four berth, with Benjamin Sesko's brace proving insufficient against Scott Parker's team.",
      "Amorim has encountered mounting scrutiny after being unable to reverse the declining form that ultimately resulted in Erik ten Hag's sacking. The former Sporting CP manager has presided over several nadir moments during his spell at the club, including a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two outfit Grimsby.",
      "A representative for The 1958 group expressed their concern, stating: \"It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.",
      "\"A manager has reportedly been dismissed not primarily for abject performances against Grimsby, Everton, West Ham, and Wolves, but allegedly for a heated exchange with Jason Wilcox. Wilcox a man with just nine months' experience as a Director of Football at Southampton is said to have attempted to interfere tactically, despite the club hiring Ruben fully aware of his rigid system. The situation beggar's belief.",
      "\"This decision was allegedly endorsed by Omar Berrada, a CEO with no prior experience in the role, listening to the complaints of a close ally rather than exercising independent leadership. We are once again witnessing Manchester United being run by executives learning on the job, at the expense of results, stability, and credibility.",
      "\"Let us be clear: this is not a defence of Ruben or the football served up under him. Much of it was unacceptable. But his dismissal once again exposes the continued dysfunction at our club. Manchester United is now a toxic partnership where fans are getting the worst of both worlds.",
      "\"WE CALL FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE OWNERSHIP, BERRADA AND WILCOX.\"",
      "They stated: \"Earlier this season, we asked supporters if they wanted to protest. Many chose to give Ratcliffe time. That time has been squandered. The situation is undeniably worse. That is why we will protest at Fulham at home on Sunday 1st February.",
      "\"Manchester United is 150 years old. That proud history, built by generations of supporters, must be protected.",
      "\"If we do not act now, the club we pass on will be unrecognisable, stripped of its culture, its soul, and its people. \"This needs to be stopped. We must fight for our club.",
      "We must fight for fan culture before it is too late. If you knew you couldn't play tomorrow, how hard would you play today?",
      "\"For Ratcliffe and the Glazers the game is over. Time is up. We can take no more and urge as many fans as possible to join us in a massive protest.\"",

      "After retiring, the 1998 World Cup winner ventured into management with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, where he won three Ligue 1 titles, and Bordeaux, where he also won the French top-flight. He also took charge of the French national team.",
      "The bookmakers' latest odds have now positioned Blanc as one of the candidates to take over at United, amongst many others. However, he could have had his chance to manage the club over a decade ago.",
      "The 60-year-old claimed he spoke to United about replacing David Moyes before Louis van Gaal was eventually appointed as manager.",
      "\"I had a call from a director, I'd prefer not to say who, and some discussion,\" Blanc told The Times in 2014, He added: \"But I was in Paris so it was very difficult for me to leave. We kept in touch but they went with Van Gaal in the end.\"",
      "Blanc was reportedly under consideration once more following Jose Mourinho's sacking by United in December 2019. However, United went on to appoint Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as caretaker manager, with the Norwegian being given the job on a permanent basis before being sacked himself in November 2021.",
      "While perhaps it's unlikely that Blanc is in the frame for the job this time around he did underline his intentions to one day manage in the Premier League.",
      "\"Managing in England is a big ambition,\" he said in 2014. \"I have big experience at Paris. \"It's difficult for me to go to another club in France. I want a different challenge in England, Spain or Italy. I played in those countries, I know them, so I keep going to games and I see what calls come in.\"",

On the chaos Solskjaer walked into last January, following Giovanni Van Bronckhorst's dismissal, Bayazit, a Besiktas podcaster said: \"It was probably the lowest point I'd seen Besiktas at in my 25 years of following the club. It was a really difficult job.",
      "\"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Bayazit admits that Solskjaer's style of play wasn't aesthetically pleasing, but insists it was necessary given the players at his disposal. He explained: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad.",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "Those big matches included a victory over Galatasaray that preserved an important piece of Besiktas history. Kuliev, an Istanbul-based football blogger, said: \"With Solskjaer, Besiktas did actually improve slightly with attack.",
      "\"They did create some more chances and also had some good results occasionally, especially the game against Galatasaray, which prevented them ending the season without losing game. That kept Besiktas as the only side in league to have season without losing single game (1991/92). Players looked more energetic after he joined.\"",
      "However, Solskjaer didn't have enough credit in the bank to survive losing in the play-off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League at the start of the season. Bayazit firmly believes Solskjaer didn't deserve to be dismissed, though.",
      "He said: \"I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.",
      "\"I don't think he was sufficiently backed by the president. Two weeks before he sacked him, he said, 'We're backing him.'",
      "Kuliev feels Solskjaer was hindered by a lack of stability at the club. He said: \"There are many issues which went wrong with Besiktas, including building the wrong squad with some imbalance among players. Also, some serious issues in administration led the team to be poorly managed financially.",
      "\"Not being able to qualify for Europe was the catalyst of his sacking but the team generally did start poorly this season and didn't show much improvement.",
      "\"Last season wasn't too much criticised as he did come to a team which had some issues already. But with such issues continuing after summer break, it was clear that the team would have same similar performance with Solskjaer. Taking into account the impatient atmosphere towards results in the Turkish football environment, this [his sacking] shouldn't be seen as a surprise.\"",
      "However, Bayazit believes he represents the ideal short-term solution for United following Ruben Amorim's dismissal. He said: \"I think it would be great for United. He has the ability to bring that team together again.",
      "\"I don't know if he is the person to take them back to their glory days. I said the same about him at Besiktas, that I didn't know if he could get us back to winning trophies. But at the time, he was the best option because he stabilised things and brought joy back to the players.",
      "\"I think Ole should have been given a lot more time at Besiktas; he could have laid the groundwork for future success with stability around him, which he didn't get.",
      "\"I think Ole did well with the pressure. It's regrettable that he got sacked when he did and it sent the club into more chaos.",
      "\"It speaks volumes about what he did in a relative short period of time, because he did bring some stability. For Manchester United, he is a good option because they're not going to get a top manager at the moment.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "After the defeat, Portuguese newspaper Record reported that, as a punishment, the Benfica squad spent the night at their Seixal training centre ahead of an early‑morning session on Thursday. \"When we get to Seixal, each player will go to their rooms and I wish they sleep as well as I do, which is to say that they don't sleep at all,\" Mourinho explained.",
      "\"That's what I want for them - that they don't sleep and that they think a lot, just like I will. Then tomorrow we can start talking, which is not what happened in the dressing room.\"",

      "\"I can't say that Braga deserved to win, I have to say that Benfica deserved to lose. We were the ones who had a horrible first half.",
      "\"From the moment [referee] Joao Pinheiro awarded the penalty that was outside the area, instead of a positive click, there was a click of negativity, nervousness and horrible quality in possession.",
      "\"A horrible first half on all levels, with so many technical errors. Unacceptable under any circumstances, even against a neighbouring sides Seixal or Amora.",
      "\"In the second half, the opposite, also inexplicable. When my teams are looking to turn results around, we can't make defensive mistakes.\"",
      "Mourinho continued: \"There are things that should only be said internally and not externally.",
      "\"I don't usually speak in the dressing room after games, but I did today. I spoke in a critical but calm tone.",
      "\"I had a conversation, which ended up being a monologue. There were absolutely unacceptable individual performances, which translated into a very weak collective performance in the first half.\"",
      "Benfica, who are enduring a challenging season and sit ten points behind rivals and league leaders FC Porto, failed to book a place in the final against Vitoria de Guimaraes.",

It's believed that discussions have taken place, with both Carrick and Solskjaer, in what could be a significant shift for United following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim.",

      "In 10 minutes, Sesko scored as many goals in Lancashire as he had managed in his first four months in England, finally looking like the striker United thought they were signing from RB Leipzig. Sesko looked like he fancied it. His movement was sharp and he forced a spectacular save from Martin Dubravka in the first half when he sent a powerful header from the edge of the box goalbound.",
      "Sesko scored an impressive brace in the second half. The Slovenia international's equaliser was well-taken, but the second goal was even better, as the cross was wonderful and he volleyed into the net.",
      "The striker recorded seven shots on target against Burnley and would have been disappointed not to have scored a hat-trick. However, Sesko must take the positives from his performance against the Clarets because it was the type of display that should provide him with encouragement.",
      "“The positive is Sesko scoring. Hopefully he gets some confidence,\" Sherwood said. \"It’s taken him six months to turn up, but I’m pleased for him. He’s had a tough run and I’d have had him off the pitch at half-time never to wear a Manchester United shirt again. I stand by what I said.",
      "\"He’s not good enough to play for Manchester United. He’s turned up for one game against Burnley, who are going to get relegated. Hopefully we start seeing something different from him.”",
      "Sherwood's criticism of Sesko at half-time was objectively harsh, but his comments at the end of the game were outright strange. Sesko finally looked like a United striker against Burnley, and yet Sherwood said he stood by his comments.",
      "Perhaps Sherwood was afraid of changing his mind and appearing to lack conviction. The truth is, having the ability to reflect and change opinion in the light of new evidence is a strength.",
      "There have been performances from Sesko this season that have certainly been worthy of criticism. He was signed for €76.5million (£66.4m), plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, and hasn't scored as many as he would have hoped, but his performance against Burnley was a step in the right direction.",
      "Sherwood should have been level-headed and constructive with his analysis. He is entitled to his opinion, but pundits have a duty to articulate criticism in a professional manner on TV.",

The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",

United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",

Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",

But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed by a club in crisis one year ago, before lifting them from seventh to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig. He pulled off a memorable Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and beat their arch city rivals, Galatasaray, to retain a proud club milestone.",
      "Manchester United are preparing for an FA Cup third-round match against Brighton while simultaneously searching the transfer market for new players and a manager. The Red Devils recently parted ways with Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge, with Darren Fletcher stepping in as caretaker manager.",
      "Speculation continues to circulate about who will take over the managerial reins, whether on a temporary or permanent basis. The incoming boss will undoubtedly need to bolster the squad as United strive for a top finish in the Premier League this season.",
      "Currently positioned seventh in the league following a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday evening, United's next challenge is the Manchester derby in the Premier League. However, their immediate focus is on Brighton in the FA Cup, a team that managed a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Monday.",
      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "Darren Fletcher will be back in the dugout for Manchester United on Sunday, when they play host Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup third round.",
      "It comes as the club continue their search to appoint a new head coach following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",

      "\"I don’t think those were the words he was looking for,\" he said. \"But I don’t agree that I’ve been nervous.",
      "\"But I do agree that I haven’t played as well as I have with the national team. I haven’t been lying at home and being angry that he has criticised me.\"",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Tottenham are interested in 46‑year‑old Italian manager Roberto De Zerbi, though he is believed to favour a move to Man United instead.",
      "It is said that De Zerbi views the Manchester United job as a 'dream opportunity' to manage the club. Although he is under contract at Marseille until the summer of 2027, he is reportedly open to leaving this summer if the right offer arrives, believing he has 'taken the French club as far as he can.'",
      "Scott McTominay's prospects of returning to Man United could be enhanced if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reinstated as manager. The club legend is rumoured to be in line for a potential comeback as interim boss following the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday.",
      "Speculation suggests it's a toss-up between Solskjaer and Michael Carrick to temporarily helm the club for the remainder of this season. It might be overly optimistic to expect a deal of McTominay's scale to be finalised this month, however, despite the pressing need for dynamism in midfield.",
      "In a 2019 assessment of the player, the Norwegian said: \"He's been excellent, and now that him and Fred work in a good relationship, work well together [sic] did that last season, PSG, when we had a few injuries and now as well they are working as a pair. Scotty's a leader, a Manchester United boy, you can see he's been a striker with the goal at Norwich on a half turn, but he's developing into a very good midfielder.\"",
      "McTominay's debut campaign in Italy read like something from a fairy tale, transforming from Old Trafford outcast to Serie A's Most Valuable Player in less than 12 months.",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure. Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss.",
      "But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit. \"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Bayazit admits Solskjaer's style of play wasn't easy on the eye but it was case of needs must at the time. He said: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad. The football was, at times, decent but never scintillating to watch. They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games. I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs. I don't think he should have got sacked when he did. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.\"",

      "Fletcher arrived at Turf Moor dressed in a Paul Smith club suit, continuing the trend of former United players-turned caretaker managers wearing a suit and tie on the touchline. The outfit choice comes from playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, who believed United representatives should dress smartly.",
      "The 41-year-old asked Ferguson for his 'blessing' to manage United against Burnley, and he carried himself with class at the pre-match press conference, shaking the hands of journalists. Fletcher should have his head held high if Burnley is the only league game he oversees as interim boss.",
      "He behaved like a United manager should before and after the clash at Turf Moor - which counts for something.",
      "It took just eight minutes for the away section to begin a rendition of 'you are my Solskjaer, my Ole Solskjaer', which felt like a seal of approval for the Norwegian's increasingly likely return. Solskjaer left on good terms in 2021, despite being booed after his final game in charge against Watford, and the club's press release announcing his sacking said: \"He will forever be welcome back.\"",
      "The 52-year-old will always be popular among fans due to his playing career, but some supporters have mixed feelings about a possible return. Those reservations are merited. The end of Solskjaer's tenure should not be forgotten, although there were positives from his stint.",
      "Carrick was part of Solskjaer's backroom staff, and he is also in contention for the job. The away fans gave Carrick their approval by signing: \"He's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes.\"",
      "It remains to be seen who will be given the interim job for the remainder of the season.",
      "Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers speaks very fondly of Michael Carrick, describing him as a manager who stood out during the early stages of his career.",
      "The Villa star spent the 2023/24 season playing under Carrick at Middlesbrough and has highlighted the influence that short spell had on his career.",
      "\"Michael Carrick, he was the coach that spoke to me away from football,\" Rogers said. \"There was always a line of communication with him which I thought was vital at that time. I still speak to him now.",
      "\"I had a difficult three years going out on loan before Middlesbrough, but I don't think I'd be the player I am now without the experiences. It gave me the toughness to go through adversity, helped me grow up and learn about myself and what I needed to improve. At that time, I wasn't ready.\"",
      "The January transfer window is now a week old and Manchester United have completed their first deal of the month.",

      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner responded to questions about being linked with the Manchester United manager's job earlier this week.",
      "Glasner has been tipped to replace Ruben Amorim in recent days, but gave a rather cryptic response when quizzed about his chances of getting the job at United.",
      "“I am not allowed to bet,” Glasner said earlier this week. “My contract has one paragraph that I am not allowed to bet. And I don’t look at it.”",
      "“I also cannot give insider information. That would also be breaking my contract. I am Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask more questions about it.\"",

      "By the end of his spell, fans had turned on the club legend with the away end at Vicarage Road making their feelings clear after a pathetic defeat to Watford. Bruno Fernandes leapt to the defence of Solskjaer that afternoon but the damage was done and the Norwegian was gone.",
      "Ralf Rangnick delivered some home truths during his interim spell in charge but Erik ten Hag could only do so much. Ruben Amorim tried to implement the 'open heart surgery' that Rangnick diagnosed after Solskjaer's first spell but his stubbornness and livewire nature brought his tenure to a premature end.",
      "Proof, if it was needed, that time heals all wounds, Solskjaer is now in the running to return to Old Trafford to see the Reds through until the end of the campaign. Whether his second spell as an interim can work as well as his first remains to be seen.",
      "However, if you are Benjamin Sesko, you should be desperate for Solskjaer to come on board to navigate the remainder of the season.",
      "The world's best striker at this moment is Erling Haaland and it has been well-documented how much the Manchester City star credits Solskjaer for helping his development. Speaking about their time together at Molde, Haaland said in 2020: \"Solskjaer and I did some practice on finishing. Not just crosses. I remember he taught me some easy rules.",
      "\"The first one was one-touch [finishes]. That I don’t use too much power and trying to destroy the goal or the goalie with ball. I think that I was thinking about doing that and it was something new that he told me. I trained a bit on that, but without scoring. But at least I had it in my head after that training session.",
      "\"He has taught me a lot to be calm, and also be on your toes and come to those situations where the ball is coming. It is then you have the chance to score. He deserves a lot of credit for teaching me that.\"",
      "If Solskjaer wants to take on a new prodigy, Sesko would be the perfect student. His two goals against Burnley show that he has what it takes to make it Old Trafford. Having someone like Solskjaer to gain advice from and ask questions to is invaluable.",

      "Casemiro was a straggler when Manchester United arrived at Turf Moor. He was detached at the back of the group as the players entered the ground, and he was off the pace throughout the game.",
      "The Brazilian delivered the kind of performance that proves why United must allow him to leave this summer and resist the temptation to extend his deal after a decent run of form at the start of the campaign.",
      "Casemiro was a passenger for both Burnley goals. The 33-year-old looked like he should have been playing walking football, rooted to the ground as Burnley passed around him.",
      "\"We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again,\" explained Darren Fletcher during his post-match press conference. Casemiro was part of the problem in Lancashire.",
      "In mid-November, United had conceded just five goals when he had been on the pitch, and 15 when he had been off it, but it was always going to be impossible for Casemiro to sustain that level of form.",
      "Casemiro will celebrate his 34th birthday next month. He deserves huge credit for even creating a conversation about whether to extend his deal when it should have been cut and dry, but the decision on his future is obvious: United must cut ties with Casemiro and bid him farewell at the end of the season.",
      "United have the option to extend Casemiro's contract by 12 months, which some have suggested makes sense, however, that would mean he would continue to be the highest earner in the dressing room. It would be an Ed Woodward-esque decision to extend Casemiro's deal, although the events of the last week show Ineos' leadership has more in common with their predecessors than they would admit.",
      "You wouldn't put it past United's hierarchy to make that decision, but they will allow Casemiro to run down his contract if they have any sense. Ruben Amorim's sacking may also influence the decision.",
      "Amorim was an advocate of Casemiro after initially overlooking him following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon. Last month, Amorim was asked whether there was an update on the contracts of Casemiro and Harry Maguire, and he said: \"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do.",
      "\"We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing. So we have so much to do at this moment. We are not thinking about that. We will just think about the next game.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he would like to keep both players for next season and responded: \"I'm really happy with them, but I don't know what is going to happen, so we will see what will happen until the end of the season, what position we will be, and then we will see.\"",
      "Discussing whether the uncertainty could impact Casemiro's form, Amorim said: \"It's not that situation, I'm not saying whether he is staying or not. Then when I see Casemiro training, if everyone trained like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in set-piece training.",
      "\"Even when they are playing 10 versus the goalkeeper and the movement that he makes. Imagine in the game, we will be a top team. If everybody works like Casemiro. And when I say work, it's not just about the running, it's the focus, and you can understand why that guy won five Champions Leagues.",
      "\"If you pay attention to everything that he does, with contract or with no contract, he's a top player.\"",
      "Amorim spoke warmly about Casemiro's work ethic and quality, to the extent that he gave the impression that the midfielder's deal could be extended under certain conditions.",
      "Casemiro lost a major ally when United announced Amorim's sacking at the beginning of the week, although he was not one of the players who thanked Amorim on social media when his exit was confirmed. The former Real Madrid midfielder posted \"we fought but couldn't get the first win of the year\" to his 22 million followers on Instagram after drawing with Leeds last weekend.",
      "United sources believe Amorim intentionally orchestrated his sacking during that post-match press conference. Casemiro wouldn't have been pleased to see a manager who trusted him walking out the door.",
      "Casemiro will also be out the exit door in a few months, provided United make the right decision.",

      "“We saw his quality, particularly with his assist against Fiorentina. We have good experience with Enzo, so why not with Sekou Kone? But to say today whether he’ll come, I don’t know. It depends on several factors; we’ll decide between January 15th and February 15th, as with all players.”",
      "Kana-Biyik was a low-key arrival in Manchester in the summer window, arriving on a free transfer from French club Le Havre before immediately joining Lausanne on a season-long loan.",

      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",

United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "\"It's a good question,\" he said. \"My experience is only tonight, so I experienced that. We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again. We sat in a little bit and maybe we should have gone for the kill and gone for the third goal.",
      "\"It all happened very quickly as well, so I've not had chance to reflect on that yet. So that's something that we'll try and look at, but it's a little bit new just now. It's a little bit fresh, so it's probably going to take a little bit of time to sit back and reflect on the game, watch it back and then try and figure out why these things keep happening.\"",
      "Fletcher added: \"I think you can get in that cycle with a little bit of confidence. I think in terms of like, there's a little bit of a feeling that can you see the game out or can you go on and win it and that's not deemed to be there yet.",
      "\"And that can only build through time and confidence and actually winning some football games and finding out what it takes to win games. Sometimes you might put in a good performance but you've got to find a way to win ugly and see out a match and it might not be pretty.",
      "\"That may be from keeping the ball, that may be from defending deep as a team, whatever that is. But the team need to figure out how to put in performances that win them games and then hopefully from there that confidence can grow.\"",

      "His two goals were superbly taken and he had eight shots in total. It was by some distance his best performance in a United shirt and it came a day after a heart-to-heart with Fletcher. The 41-year-old Scot sat the striker down at Carrington on Tuesday and boosted his confidence with a video that showed his strengths.",

I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",

      "Darren Fletcher did not look pleased, but United came out swinging at the start of the second half, and Benjamin Sesko scored twice in relatively quick succession to make it 2-1. However, Burnley drew level thanks to a great strike from Jaidon Anthony, which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "The anti-Ratcliffe banner",
      "A banner reading 'Jim can't fix this' was unfurled before the game, implying Sir Jim Ratcliffe doesn't have what it takes to turn the club around. The banner was in response to a tumultuous week, which saw Ruben Amorim sacked, Fletcher hired as interim boss, and talks opened with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer over a possible return.",
      "Ratcliffe bemoaned the mistakes of the previous regime when he took control of football operations at Old Trafford, but the Ineos team have created a mess themselves. Omar Berrada oversaw the appointment of Amorim, a coach wedded to playing with five at the back, and Jason Wilcox interfered with the team's tactics, which is a red flag from a director of football.",
      "United sources insisted there had been no power struggle when Amorim's sacking was confirmed, but it was impossible to pull the wool over fans' eyes following his final press conference. Berrada and Wilcox were at Turf Moor and they were both spotted shaking their heads when Burnley opened the scoring. United fans have been shaking their heads at the pair in the last few days.",
      "Thumbs up for Sesko",
      "Sesko was unfortunate not to score in the first half when he sent an outstanding header goal-bound from the edge of the box. The header had to be perfect to have a chance of going in from that distance - and Sesko was just denied by a beautiful save from former United loanee Martin Dubravka.",
      "The Slovenia international looked in the mood from the first whistle, a stark contrast to last weekend against Leeds, and he received a big thumbs up from Fletcher when he equalised - the interim boss clearly knows how crucial Sesko could be in United's push for a European spot. Sesko's second goal was even better. The cross into the box was wonderful, but he still had plenty to do and finished with the kind of ruthlessness that fans doubted he had in his locker.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was responsible for the assist and sprinted to Sesko, who had a huge smile on his face as his teammates celebrated with him. Just last week, Sesko's teammates had their hands on their heads as he sent a potential match-winner wide of the post in the final 20 minutes against Leeds.",
      "Sesko scored as many Premier League goals against Burnley as he'd managed in his first four months in Manchester. Everyone is hoping Sesko's brace in Lancashire signals the beginning of a purple patch.",
      "Huge cheer for Lacey",
      "There was a huge cheer from the away section when Fletcher introduced Shea Lacey for Manuel Ugarte for the final seven minutes of the game. Amorim frustrated fans by regularly bringing on centre-backs in the closing stages of matches, so it was refreshing to see an attacking substitution instead.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his debut at Villa Park last month. The 18-year-old's first appearance could have come sooner, though, as he'd been knocking on the door for months before his senior bow.",
      "Lacey showed what he can do when smacking the crossbar from the edge of the box just minutes after coming on at Turf Moor. The attacking change from Fletcher was inches away from being a masterstroke.",
      "Fletcher's classy arrival",
      "Fletcher arrived at Turf Moor dressed in a Paul Smith club suit, continuing the trend of former United players-turned caretaker managers wearing a suit and tie on the touchline. The outfit choice comes from playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, who believed United representatives should dress smartly.",
      "The 41-year-old asked Ferguson for his 'blessing' to manage United against Burnley, and he carried himself with class at the pre-match press conference, shaking the hands of journalists. Fletcher should have his head held high if Burnley is the only league game he oversees as interim boss. He behaved like a United manager should before and after the clash at Turf Moor - which counts for something.",
      "Solskjaer and Carrick chants",
      "It took just eight minutes for the away section to begin a rendition of 'you are my Solskjaer, my Ole Solskjaer', which felt like a seal of approval for the Norwegian's increasingly likely return. Solskjaer left on good terms in 2021, despite being booed after his final game in charge against Watford, and the club's press release announcing his sacking said: \"He will forever be welcome back.\"",
      "The 52-year-old will always be popular among fans due to his playing career, but some supporters have mixed feelings about a possible return. Those reservations are merited. The end of Solskjaer's tenure should not be forgotten, although there were positives from his stint.",
      "Carrick was part of Solskjaer's backroom staff, and he is also in contention for the job. The away fans gave Carrick their approval by signing: \"He's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes.\"",
      "It remains to be seen who will be given the interim job for the remainder of the season.",

Under-18s boss Darren Fletcher took charge of Wednesday's draw with Burnley and will continue in charge for the weekend's FA Cup clash with Brighton.",
      "United are understood to be acting to appoint an interim head coach until the end of the season, before bringing in a permanent manager for the 2026/27 season. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, and Ruud van Nistelrooy have all held talks about returning to the club.",
      "\"Do I think it's the right or wrong answer? I don't know. If it's until the end of the season, I think Ole would do alright. Do I see Ole as the manager for the next four or five seasons, getting United back competing, then probably not.\"",
      "\"I know he's not for everyone, he'll have his critics but I like what he's done at Newcastle and Bournemouth, he's managed 700 to 800 games, he's still a young man. I love his calmness, I think sometimes Man United need a bit of that.",
      "\"We've seen the previous manager going in - I like people with emotion, obviously I'm quite an emotional person - but I think his calmness, what he's done at Newcastle, Champions League a couple of times, winning the (League) Cup. I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",
      "Keane was also vocal on United's current search for a short-term fix until the end of the season. \"You want to go into the dressing room and as soon as he [the manager] walks in, you go, 'Here we go, we're going places',\" he said.",
      "\"People talk about CVs, coaching and tactics. You want somebody to go into that dressing room and get a grip of these players. I don't mean in an aggressive way, just to get that belief into the players.\"",
      "He added: \"United Burnley, the standard of the game was a joke. Everyone after the game was like, 'It wasn't bad, we did well' – nonsense! Absolute rubbish. We're going around in circles. Any ex-United player has got a chance.\"",

      "Manchester United have had a hectic week, juggling the search for a new head coach whilst exploring January transfer opportunities following Ruben Amorim's dismissal.",
      "The Portuguese boss was relieved of his duties on Monday morning, with the Reds revealing the move was designed to provide the club with the \"best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher stepped in as caretaker head coach for United's league fixture against Burnley on Wednesday, though after the match ended 2-2 at Turf Moor, the board may seek someone with greater experience to oversee matters until the season concludes, at which point they'll thoroughly evaluate their options.",
      "Both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have emerged as potential candidates for the interim role through to May, with discussions between the club and both individuals expected this week. Whoever assumes the temporary position could be granted the chance to strengthen the squad during this transfer window.",
      "Taking everything into account, the MEN examines several players who have recently been associated with a potential switch to Old Trafford....",
      "Scott McTominay has been linked with a remarkable return to the north west following his impressive performances at Napoli. The Scottish midfielder joined the Serie A side in 2024, playing a key role in Gli Azzurri securing the league title during his first season, reports the Mirror.",
      "However, if Solskjaer is appointed as the interim head coach at Old Trafford, he might push for a reunion with their academy product. Reflecting on the midfielder's performance in 2019, Solskjaer said: \"He's been excellent, and now that him and Fred work in a good relationship, work well together did that last season, PSG, when we had a few injuries and now as well they are working as a pair.",
      "\"Scotty's a leader, a Manchester United boy, you can see he's been a striker with the goal at Norwich on a half turn, but he's developing into a very good midfielder.\"",
      "Currently, United's midfield appears to be lacking depth, with Bruno Fernandes being forced into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro, whose future at the club beyond this season remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Kobbie Mainoo has seen his playing time reduced recently, while Manuel Ugarte seems to be on the brink of departure.",
      "Considering these factors, McTominay could be just the player that the Premier League heavyweights need right now. And with Solskjaer potentially back in charge, it could certainly entice the 29-year-old to return to the club where he first made his mark, given their rapport.",
      "According to reports, Ajax are keen on securing Ugarte this month. Dutch publication VI suggests that the Uruguayan is open to a move to the Eredivisie giants after struggling to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "A loan deal until the end of the season seems the most feasible option for Ajax, although his reported weekly wage of £120,000 could pose a challenge. This could lead United to negotiate the percentage of the salary that Ajax would be willing to cover.",
      "Since transferring from PSG to Old Trafford in a £42.1million deal in 2024, Ugarte has made 61 appearances across all competitions for Manchester United.",
      "Following his impressive performances in Brazil, Manchester United are among several clubs linked with 20-year-old midfielder Breno Bidon. Reports suggest that Corinthians value the young talent at around £26m this winter - a fee that could appeal to the Reds given their current midfield struggles.",
      "However, landing the central midfielder may not be straightforward for United, as Arsenal and Sporting CP have also been linked with him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Premier League clubs are hunting for deals as the January transfer window intensifies. Manchester City and Manchester United are among the top-flight clubs who will be keen to strengthen their squads, just months after a record-breaking summer that saw the league spend an astonishing £3billion on new signings.",
      "While notable signings are usually reserved for the summer, January offers an opportunity to begin rebuilding sooner. Manchester City was responsible for nearly half of the Premier League's £370m expenditure last winter, as Pep Guardiola sought to rejuvenate his squad.",
      "A club's transfer budget is not just based on the wealth of their owners but also hinges on adhering to profit and sustainability rules (PSR). Furthermore, teams aiming to qualify for European competition must take into account UEFA's squad cost ratio (SCR).",
      "PSR restricts losses to £105million over a three-year span, which is reduced by £22m for each year a club is not in the Premier League. On the other hand, SCR permits clubs to allocate up to 70 per cent of their revenue towards squad-related expenses.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Despite grappling with these financial regulations, the January window presents teams with a chance to fortify both short-term and long-term prospects. Manchester City are nearing a deal for Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, who has a £65m release clause, as Guardiola's side aim to close the gap on league leaders Arsenal.",
      "Manchester United may not be enjoying the same type of success as their city rivals but the club still have the capacity to bolster their squad this month. Despite sacking manager Ruben Amorim earlier this week and having no European football, United could potentially spend £100m on new signings.",
      "\"Again, from an SCR point of view, which is the new rules which are kicking in, [United are] spending around half their revenue on wages. So they've got huge capacity,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told the Mirror. \"It's then a case of, can they spend the money?",
      "\"Well, yes, they've got a lot of debt but they're still well within their overdraft limit. What Manchester United tend to do is to buy players on credit. So they owe £466m in outstanding transfer fees for players that they've signed in the past.",
      "\"I think that's more of an issue for the summer of 2026 rather than January. If they spend £100m in January, they'll be spreading that over three or four years. So from a cash point of view, it's not really going to make a difference. If that's the difference between Champions League and not Champions League, they've got to go for it if it's going to improve the squad.\"",
      "At the top of the table, Arsenal invested heavily last summer to bolster Mikel Arteta's squad in a bid to finally win the title. Arsenal shelled out around £250m on new signings in the summer and, according to football finance expert Kieran Maguire, could potentially spend another £100m this month.",
      "\"We haven't seen their financial results for this year yet, but they will have a lot of headroom from a PSR point of view,\" Maguire told the Mirror. \"Arsenal have got plenty of wiggle room in January. Yes, they signed players in the summer, but even so, compared to some of the other clubs, it wasn't excessive.\"",
      "He added: \"So if Arsenal wanted to spend, they could spend far in excess of £100million. I think the issue is whether players are available who are not cup-tied from a Champions League point of view. Arsenal are very strong financially. Their losses in the last couple of years were £70m and under the Premier League rules you are allowed to lose £105m. So again, they have got plenty of headroom. A very smart club.\"",
      "Not all clubs will be able to match Arsenal's January budget. Aston Villa, sitting third in the table have previously made astute signings in the New Year under Unai Emery - a list that includes Morgan Rogers, Jhon Duran and Marcus Rashford - and have welcomed young winger Alysson from Gremio. However, as demonstrated by their quiet summer, Villa will be wary of complying with financial rules, rather than spending big to mount a title challenge.",
      "Liverpool were the biggest spenders in the last transfer window, splashing out more than £100m each on Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak during a costly summer. Arne Slot's side have fallen short of expectations so far this season but could still turn to the transfer market to help salvage the campaign.",
      "\"Liverpool have got the benefit of, yes, they had a spectacular summer of 2025, but if you take a look at their losses in the two previous years, they were never in danger of breaching PSR,\" Maguire said.",
      "However, the reigning Premier League champions have the extra dilemma of dealing with Mohamed Salah's future. The experienced forward has 18 months remaining on his contract but had been outspoken about losing his place in the team shortly before representing Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "On Salah's situation, Maguire added: \"Well, his wages are probably going to be something like £15m a year. So, if he left he would free up the wage budget. On top of that, because he's been there so long, effectively any money that they get is pure profit. And that goes into your top line.\"",
      "Chelsea seem unlikely to make any significant signings after recently appointing Liam Rosenior as manager. However, both Newcastle and Tottenham reportedly have substantial transfer budgets this month, while Bournemouth and Brighton are also looking for new players.",
      "At the bottom of the Premier League, Burnley will be looking to bolster their squad to aid in their battle against relegation. Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest and West Ham will be on the lookout for new signings as they aim to distance themselves from the drop zone, with the Hammers having already secured a new striker.",

      "Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher has confirmed the team's tactical approach will be \"fluid\" against Burnley tonight. United are set to take on Burnley in the Premier League, just two days after Ruben Amorim's sacking amid rising tensions with the Old Trafford hierarchy.",
      "Fletcher has been appointed on an interim basis and Burnley could be his only game in charge, with talks having taken place with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week. The former midfielder has made just one change from the draw with Leeds, recalling Fernandes to the starting team at the expense of Leny Yoro, and Fletcher is expected to play with four at the back.",
      "Speaking to MUTV about the team's tactical approach, Fletcher said: \"Tactics are fluid in and out of possession. We want movement, we want rotation, we have to exploit the spaces the opponents give you.",
      "\"But the players are the ones who cross the white line who have to deliver. We've got some smart, experienced players. If they see something, I trust them to have the autonomy to exploit it.\"",
      "The 41-year-old also confirmed that starting Fernandes upon his return from injury was always the plan. \"It's important Bruno's back but that was always part of the plan,\" he explained.",
      "\"This game was targeted for a couple of players coming back from injury so we've got a stronger bench tonight. Looking forward to seeing the lads play, we've set them up in a way we think is best for us to win the match that suits their personalities and suits their styles and it's up to them to execute it.\"",
      "United announced Amorim's sacking on Monday. Amorim left with the worst win ratio (32 per cent) in the Premier League of any United manager, but United are still well-positioned to secure European football.",
      "The Reds are sixth in the top flight, just three points adrift of Liverpool in fourth position.",

      "Darren Fletcher won't tell his former teammates now working in the media to go easy on his Manchester United team, despite the criticism being levelled at players and the club being raised under Ruben Amorim. In his press conference broadside at club officials on Sunday, Amorim suggested that even executives were influenced by criticism from the likes of Gary Neville.",
      "The club's former right-back is one of a cohort of United greats who have waded in on the club in their media roles, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes also heavily critical. Those attacks have damaged the confidence of some players and caused divisions between the dressing room and some United greats, but Fletcher believes those now wearing the shirt should embrace the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can’t ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher said of the critical pundits he played with. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Although the withering attacks on a string of disappointing performances and underwhelming seasons have been seen internally as damaging, Fletcher turned the equation on its head and said players should be grateful for the support they receive inside Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters have rarely turned on the team despite their struggles, with Fletcher pointing out that wouldn't be the case everywhere given the struggles United have endured in recent years, with finishes of sixth, eighth and 15th in three of the previous four seasons.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "The irony of Manchester United's new power structure appointing Ruben Amorim as the club's first head coach in November 2024 is that a few months earlier, his name hadn't really been in the frame at all. That was the summer when Liverpool considered appointing Amorim, only to opt for Arne Slot amid concerns over the Portuguese's system, his stubbornness in playing it and how the squad would fit. Those concerns were cast aside at Old Trafford later in the year.",
      "But for a few heady, confusing weeks in the summer of 2024, change was in the air at United, too. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had decided to sack Erik ten Hag and contenders to replace him were lined up on the catwalk. Then Ten Hag won the FA Cup final, United dithered and the Dutchman stayed, new contract, pay rise and all.",
      "Before that, Ratcliffe spoke to potential replacements as United scoured the market. They met with Thomas Tuchel in Monaco and the German was right at the top of the list of likely appointments, should they have gone through with the decision to dispense with Ten Hag.",
      "There were also talks with Premier League managers, as Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Roberto De Zerbi were all considered. However, there was little indication that Amorim was part of the conversation before the Ibiza summit, which led to Ten Hag staying.",
      "That decision was reversed within four months, with no improvement in results under the Dutchman. As United looked for a replacement this time, Amorim was high on the shortlist. For all the reservations of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and his colleagues at Anfield, the Sporting head coach's stock was high.",
      "Perhaps the switch to Amorim and a coach with such a unique style of play can be attributed to chief executive Omar Berrada settling into the job. Berrada was particularly taken by Amorim's personality and charisma. Speaking to the BBC in March of this year, Ratcliffe explained the decision to stick with Ten Hag as one made at \"short notice\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, we are a consensus organisation,\" he said. \"So there's a collection of us who make decisions. It's not just me that makes the decision, it involves that management team.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik the management team hadn't been in place more than five minutes. Omar [Berrada] had only just arrived, Jason [Wilcox] had not been there terribly long, so we didn't really have the management team in place for very long to make… it was a very difficult decision to make at short notice.\"",
      "That consensus was lacking when Amorim was appointed. Berrada and Ratcliffe might have been on board with the decision, but Wilcox needed convincing and Ashworth's doubts never dissipated. Having insisted that a football structure would make a decision on a style of play, Ratcliffe turned to a head coach who was unique in this department.",
      "What does that tell us about the next search for a head coach, now that Amorim has gone? The structure is more settled, with Ashworth having also left. Berrada and Wilcox are the key figures, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell on the rise. Ratcliffe will again be involved.",
      "The management team that Ratcliffe discussed should be able to make the right decision this time, but they will be under pressure to do so. Given the names under consideration in June 2024, the decision to appoint Amorim felt like a change in strategy. Maybe it warns us to expect the unexpected as United consider their options this time around.",

      "Manchester United supporters have delivered a clear message to Sir Jim Ratcliffe before tonight's Premier League encounter at Burnley following Ruben Amorim's dismissal. Amorim departed the club on Monday morning, less than 24 hours after the 1-1 stalemate at Leeds United.",
      "The decision followed the Portuguese manager's explosive outburst during his post-match media briefing. Darren Fletcher has been installed as caretaker boss for the fixture at Turf Moor, whilst the club weighs up their options for appointing an interim head coach through to the season's conclusion.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick emerge as the frontrunners. Nevertheless, the visiting supporters at Burnley have voiced their opinions on the circumstances.",
      "A banner declaring: \"JIM CAN'T FIX THIS\" was visible from the away section before kick-off. Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have also faced criticism this week.",
      "It's believed that Wilcox arranged a discussion with Amorim last week regarding tactical matters, though it ended with both parties failing to reach a consensus.",
      "Prior to the match, it was revealed that Solskjaer and Carrick had both held additional discussions with the United hierarchy.",
      "Solskjaer is reportedly the preferred choice to assume control for the remainder of this campaign, having previously excelled in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "The Norwegian succeeded Jose Mourinho in 2018 and secured victory in 14 of his 19 matches as interim manager before receiving the permanent appointment.",
      "He guided the club to a runner-up position and consecutive top-four placings, though was dismissed in November 2021.",
      "Solskjaer is set to return to Norway tomorrow from his Cheshire residence to attend a close friend's funeral.",
      "However, it's understood that he could be appointed before the start of next week. A permanent successor is anticipated to take over at the end of the season.",
      "Thomas Tuchel, who was previously targeted before the appointment of Amorim in November 2024, remains a top contender.",
      "Other potential candidates include Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino.",

Everyone wants to know who the new man in the Old Trafford hotseat will be and we're here to answer your questions on the topic.",

      "It will be a proud night for the Fletcher family when Darren enters the dugout, potentially with sons Jack and Tyler following, for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Burnley at Turf Moor. The 41-year-old was appointed interim manager of the Reds on Monday following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "In his first press conference, Fletcher refused to say whether his twin sons, who joined from Manchester City in 2023, would be part of the matchday squad. But if they are, it will undoubtedly be the first time a manager and his twins have been part of the backroom staff and squad in the Premier League.",
      "While that is not a guarantee to happen tonight, there are some scenarios which we expect to pan out at Turf Moor during Fletcher's first game in charge of the Reds. So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what we think will happen.",
      "Considering the fallout from Amorim's sacking, it seems highly unlikely Fletcher will choose to stick with a back three formation. The Portuguese head coach looked to appease the owners on Boxing Day by playing a back four against Newcastle and it worked.",
      "By no means was the performance perfect, particularly in the second half, but it was the last time United tasted victory and it seems certain the back four will return at Turf Moor. It also makes more sense to play a four at the back now, considering the players at Fletcher's disposal.",
      "Amad is United's best wing-back but he is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Diogo Dalot has played on the left and right, but he is much better as a full-back and thus a return to this system would be beneficial for the Reds.",
      "There must have been an audible sigh of relief among United households across the world when Fletcher announced Bruno Fernandes would be back in the matchday squad tonight. Not only is Fernandes the captain, but he is also the star player in a team which struggles for consistency.",
      "You have to wonder in the games against Wolves and Leeds whether United would have won had Fernandes been on the park. The Portuguese midfielder has a knack of creating moments of magic out of seemingly impossible situations and his creativity has been missed desperately.",
      "Of course, Fernandes may not play the full 90 minutes, considering his recent return from injury. But, we can expect Fletcher to lean in heavily on the captain and potentially even start him - if only for the first 45 minutes - to rouse the troops.",
      "Whether the fans make their feelings towards the boardroom clear tonight will be interesting to see. A lot of supporters have been left angered by the manner in which Sir Jim Ratcliffe has run football operations since acquiring a minority stake in the club.",
      "This does not necessarily mean they are unhappy Amorim has gone, but there will likely be a large amount of fans travelling to Burnley who feel Ratcliffe has embarrassed the club with another quick upheaval. Should the travelling supporters voice those opinions, remains to be seen.",
      "What is not in doubt is the rousing reception Fletcher will receive as he strides out at Turf Moor this evening. United fans adore most of their ex-players, as will be proven if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer takes on the caretaker role until the end of the season.",
      "And one certainty Fletcher can rely on is the away fans backing both him and the team tonight.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United reportedly have a new manager at the ‘top of their list’ to replace Ruben Amorim in the summer, while Oliver Glasner has made a ‘demand’.",
      "Man Utd are currently without a permanent manager as they opted to part company with former head coach Ruben Amorim on Monday morning.",
      "United legend Darren Fletcher has since stepped up from his role in the academy to become interim boss and led the team in Wednesday’s disappointing 2-2 draw against Burnley.",
      "It has also been reported that fellow legends Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are the prime candidates to replace Amorim until the summer, at which point the Red Devils will appoint a long-term successor.",
      "Looking ahead, Man Utd are being linked with several potential long-term replacements for Amorim, though it was initially reported that Crystal Palace boss Glasner is the ‘top candidate’.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man United v Brighton, Thomas Frank, Chelsea, Gabriel Jesus, Saudi Clasico",
      "Thomas Tuchel, Luis Enrique, Mauricio Pochettino and Andoni Iraola have also been mentioned, but a report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Glasner has set a ‘non-negotiable demand’ if he’s to replace Amorim.",
      "The report explains: ‘Insiders reveal that Glasner’s primary condition revolves around transfer assurances, ensuring he has the resources to reshape the squad in his image.",
      "‘“Oliver isn’t one to take on a new project without the tools to succeed,” a well-placed source told us.’",
      "However, Man Utd could end up looking elsewhere as talkSPORT reporter Alex Crook is “hearing” that current England boss Tuchel is “very much at the top of the list”.",
      "Tuchel is likely to give up his role with England after this summer’s World Cup, with Crook also explaining why a Man Utd chief could be “on the chopping block” in the coming months.",
      "“The name that I keep hearing come the summer is Thomas Tuchel,” Crook told talkSPORT.",
      "“The England manager is very much at the top of Man United’s list. Now, he turned down the opportunity before becoming the England manager but I don’t think that necessarily means that he wouldn’t entertain the idea.",
      "“I would be fascinated to see how he operates alongside Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada and Christopher Vivell and if we’d get the same sort of frustration that clearly Ruben Amorim did towards the end.",
      "“I also wonder just how secure Jason Wilcox’s position actually is. He’s got to get this interim appointment right.",
      "“If they appoint the wrong man and results don’t improve and they miss out on European football I don’t think it will be the interim manager who’s head will be on the chopping block this time around.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano has confirmed the “clear favourite” to lead Manchester United until the summer, while five factors will be behind a permanent appointment.",
      "Keith Wyness has explained why Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner might turn down the opportunity to manage Manchester United.",
      "Marc Guehi is on Man City’s radar for a January move after Ruben Dias picked up a hamstring injury.",
      "Oliver Glasner is the ‘top candidate’ to be Manchester United’s next permanent head coach, with this the XI we think he would select if he’s appointed…",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Newcastle manager Eddie Howe have responded to rumours they could replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd.",
      "Thomas Tuchel is very unlikely to leave England before the World Cup, but a move to Manchester United in the summer has not been ruled out."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘tabled an offer’ for Liverpool target Yan Diomande, though a transfer hinges on one ‘huge’ condition.",
      "The RB Leipzig sensation is being linked with several European giants as he is enjoying a breakout season for the Bundesliga outfit this term.",
      "Manchester United are among those linked with Diomande, as they are said to be keen on further strengthening their attack this year.",
      "In the summer, the Red Devils focused on overhauling their attack as they spent over £200m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Sesko has struggled, but Mbeumo and Cunha have made a huge impact as the club has swiftly become overly reliant on the two forwards.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man United v Brighton, Thomas Frank, Chelsea, Gabriel Jesus, Saudi Clasico",
      "Caught Offside has provided an update on Diomande’s situation, claiming Man Utd have already ‘tabled an offer’ for the RB Leipzig star.",
      "However, the report has explained why a January move is unlikely as RB Leipzig insist on receiving 100 million euros (£86m) for their prized asset.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Sources have informed CaughtOffside that Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham from the Premier League, Bayern Munich in Germany, PSG in France and Barcelona in Spain are all “closely monitoring” the player. The market mood points to “summer, not January,” with Leipzig expected to keep the door shut until bids near the €100m mark arrive later in the year.",
      "‘United have already moved forward, with reports suggesting talks over a five‑plus‑one‑year deal worth around €3.5m per season. Leipzig have allowed discussions despite their stance against a January sale. Still, the picture is clear: unless a huge bid lands now, Diomande’s future battle will be fought in the summer among Europe’s biggest clubs.’",
      "Exits could raise funds for signings this season, with Bruno Fernandes linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League after he recently hit out at club chiefs.",
      "Now, Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Ruben Amorim played a “crucial” role in keeping Fernandes in the summer.",
      "“On Bruno Fernandes, Ruben Amorim was crucial last summer in convincing him to stay when Saudi proposals arrived, including from Al-Hilal. Amorim pushed strongly for Bruno to remain part of the project,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“With Amorim leaving, it does not mean Bruno will leave. Not in January. His focus remains on Manchester United.",

      "It might be a week later than is correct and proper, but it’s still FA Cup third-round weekend and one could, if one were so inclined, spend pretty much the entire weekend watching nothing but football.",
      "Via the combination of vast swathes of televised cup games, and the Women’s Super League, and the Football League, and the assorted European leagues now back in full swing, and AFCON and assorted international youth action, you really are pretty much set.",
      "There’s even the A-League for the night owls who want something to watch at ungodly hours now the Ashes is, mercifully, over.",
      "It is, inevitably though, the FA Cup that dominates our thoughts.",
      "",
      "Who knows who will actually be in the dugout for Manchester United by the time Sunday afternoon rolls around, but it’s probably going to be a former United man who played under Sir Alex Ferguson, because remaining in deep and perpetual thrall to the Cult of Ferg has gone so well up to now.",
      "Will it be Darren Fletcher? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? Michael Carrick? Solskjaer and Carrick? All bloody three of them and maybe Steve Bruce as well because why not? Who knows. Certainly not us, that’s for sure.",
      "What we do know is that this is a choppy little fixture for Man United and whichever of Fergie’s disciples happen(s) to be in charge on the day. Having gone out of the Carabao at the earliest possible opportunity via that infamous disaster at Grimsby and having failed to qualify for Europe after the even more embarrassing act of losing an actual final to actual Spurs, United now face the very real prospect of the smallest possible season.",
      "That comes with some perks, of course, but is just not really the done thing when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. If they come unstuck against draw specialists Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend – and United’s win over the Seagulls this season snapped a three-game losing home streak against them – it’ll be a potless 40-game season for a once proud club.",
      "What is left of the season will be spent on a probably unsuccessful bid to achieve Champions League football under some combination of caretakers and interims. It’s no life, that, is it?",
      "As for Brighton, they join your Evertons and your Villas and your Forests among the more conspicuous remaining trophy-dodgers after last season’s astonishing run of success for others of that ilk like Palace and Newcastle and Spurs.",
      "Feels like we say this every single season and it never ever happens, but the FA Cup surely presents a wonderful opportunity for Brighton to do something genuinely staggering. Especially when they’re so safely ensconced as the most mid-table side in the Premier League’s most mid-table season ever.",
      "If nothing else, the sight of Palace winning it must have stirred something.",
      "",
      "From one chaotic Big Six club to another as Chelsea begin their new project under Liam Rosenior having used all their expert boardroom negotiating skills to lure him away from Strasbourg. What a coup that is, by the way.",
      "Rosenior was in the directors’ box to watch Calum McFarlane’s side slip to a pretty ropey 2-1 defeat at Fulham in midweek, but now starts life on his shiny new six-year (stop laughing, please) contract with a short trip to Charlton.",
      "It’s been 19 years since Chelsea last played Charlton, and the winning goal that day came from a certain Frank Lampard which just keeps the whole manager narrative ticking along nicely.",
      "Fair to say this looks like the easier of the two early cup dates on Rosenior’s immediate to-do list, with Arsenal up next in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg. It’s a relatively gentle start that clearly comes with only one acceptable outcome.",
      "That makes it all the more exciting, though, and there’s no doubt a certain wild unpredictability crept into Chelsea’s football during the final weeks of Enzo Maresca’s increasingly curious tenure and even across McFarlane’s two games.",
      "Even harder to predict what on earth Chelsea might serve up here under a new manager with so little experience of his new level, but the fact it feels roughly equally plausible for Chelsea to go full banana skin as it does for them to win 8-0 or something suggests it should be worth tuning in.",
      "",
      "We’re assuming he starts for Arsenal at Portsmouth with Viktor Gyokeres back in the XI for the Chelsea Carabao semi-final clash in midweek, but honestly who knows now? If we’re wrong, just imagine we put Gyokeres here instead.",
      "It will be a big chance for whoever gets the start anyway, with Gyokeres’ already much-discussed disappearing act in several games reaching new lows in an eight-touch effort in the pouring rain of the very dampest 0-0 squib against Liverpool.",
      "Jesus came on late in the second half and certainly helped liven things up, having Arsenal’s first attempt on goal of the second half just as the clock ticked past 90 minutes and into injury time.",
      "One imagines that chances will be slightly more forthcoming for whoever is in at Portsmouth as Arsenal embark upon the fourth prong of what is quite probably only now days away from being considered a genuine quadruple tilt even though quadruple tilts by English teams absolutely never, ever amount to anything.",
      "To be honest, Arsenal’s best bet might be to get knocked out of this and just win the other three rather than risk spreading themselves too thinly. But are they willing to listen to such good advice and simply win the Premier League, Champions League and Carabao or like Icarus will they fly too close to the sun and chase the impossible?",
      "",
      "It’s all about optics, isn’t it? The photos of Thomas Frank wandering gormlessly around Bournemouth looking gormless with a little Arsenal-branded coffee cup in his hand already have a Steve McClaren wally-with-the-brolly quality to them. When – and it is surely now when not if – the axe finally falls on this doomed experiment, those are the pictures that will accompany this story’s telling.",
      "There is a profound Spurs quality to the absurdity of it all, of course. The series of events that leads to it even being possible just feels like something that only happens and could only happen to Spurs.",
      "But also… consider the reverse. Imagine Mikel Arteta was ‘caught’ supping from a Spurs cup. It would all feel very different, wouldn’t it? The memes would all be about ‘drinking Spurs tears’ and such. Even a few short months ago, this daft little incident happening exactly as it now has would have produced many banters about the impressiveness of finding a cup with Arsenal’s name on it. How we’d have laughed.",
      "Point is, it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s all a projection. But a powerful one nevertheless, one that comes to symbolise everything for a manager who arrived as a details man and now can’t even spot a big ol’ Arsenal badge on a little coffee cup.",
      "What actually does matter, we fear, is that Frank has started talking complete b*llocks. Again, pretty understandable that anyone tasked with managing Spurs eventually finds themselves doing so, but it’s not a sign of anything good.",
      "Consider this astonishing guff.",
      "“In a storm, some are building fences and hiding behind it, others are building windmills and getting stronger and getting more energy and learning from it.”",
      "Now that’s the sort of thing you might normally expect to find written on a toilet wall, but written in sh*t. Or worse, on LinkedIn. Or worse still, on a Jake Humphrey podcast.",
      "But here’s the thing that’s even worse than talking like a Jake Humphrey podcast guest – if you can even imagine such a concept. It doesn’t even actually work on its own batsh*t terms.",
      "First of all, if you’re building anything in a storm then you’ve already f*cked it by failing to adequately prepare yourself. Build the windmill before the storm arrives, if anything.",
      "But also… Frank is no windmill-builder. He has spent recent weeks complaining about the fans, repeatedly pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if that is normal or acceptable rather than the specific thing he has been tasked with changing rather than aiming to repeat, and noting that January is a very difficult month.",
      "The storm has arrived and he’s been busy building crappy little fences and drinking Arsenal coffee.",
      "Anyway, on Saturday his dreary Spurs team take on an Aston Villa team that’s already beaten them once at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this season and will fully expect to do so again. And with that will go the last lingering hope of Spurs enjoying any escape from the drudgery of trying to make sure a bad season doesn’t become a truly catastrophic one.",
      "Barring, of course, a Champions League knockout run of such vanishing unlikelihood as to make the 2019 effort look prosaic.",
      "There is no avoiding the thought that Thomas Frank’s fictitious windmill is about to get all spattered with some more very real sh*t.",
      "",
      "An inevitably reduced League One and Two schedule with cup runs still ongoing all over the shop, but that doesn’t deny us a pretty big game in the keenly-contested League One promotion race as Stockport and Huddersfield – separated by no points but two places in the play-off spots – clash at Edgeley Park.",
      "Stockport have been hit and miss since going out of the FA Cup on penalties to League Two Cambridge, with as many wins as defeats in seven subsequent games while Huddersfield have put a four-match losing run in autumn – including a 2-1 defeat to Stockport at the John Smith’s – behind them but remain too prone to draws despite losing just two of their last 12 league games.",
      "",
      "What better way to round out a weekend full of all manner of cup magic than by tuning into the final of the Spanish Super Cup, which will be played between Barcelona and Real Madrid now the formalities of getting rid of semi-finalists Atletico Madrid and Athletic Club have been taken care of.",
      "Admittedly, you might argue that what would be better would be doing all of the above but watching it happen in Spain rather than Saudi Arabia but there’s not much we can do about that at this time.",
      "",
      "Third plays fourth as these two try desperately to keep up with the ferocious pace currently being set by Man City at the top of the table and all too aware that neither of them have yet shaken off Tottenham in what is for now looking like a four-way battle also involving fallen perennial champions Chelsea for two Champions League spots.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Martinelli come in for different criticism after ‘pathetic’ and ‘soft’ Arsenal ‘totally froze’ when Liverpool put on a ‘clinic’.",
      "It is naive to think that in a world increasingly influenced by AI, football will continue to go unaffected. It would certainly be cheaper to ChatGPT it.",
      "Liverpool fans are torn between writing this off as a transition season and seeing this tripe as the beginning of the end for Arne Slot.",
      "The media would much rather Liverpool making signings than Man City so everybody pretends Jamie Redknapp knows…",
      "Leeds United goalkeeper Lucas Perri appears to have lost the confidence of his manager, while Guglielmo Vicario is struggling with the Spurs circus…",
      "Antoine Semenyo is finally in the Premier League team of the season after his tenth goal v Tottenham."

      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur’s decision on whether to sack head coach Thomas Frank will be determined by one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "Former Brentford boss Frank replaced Ange Postecoglou at Spurs in the summer and was tasked with steadying the ship after their shambolic performances in the Premier League last term.",
      "Frank has turned Spurs into more of a defensive unit this term and they initially benefited from this change, but performances and results have massively declined in recent months.",
      "The north London outfit have only won one of their previous 13 matches in all competitions as Frank has alienated himself with his uninspiring tactics and odd outbursts in press conferences.",
      "Spurs suffered another defeat on Wednesday night as they were beaten 3-2 by AFC Bournemouth, who headed into the match on a run of ten games without a victory.",
      "READ: Premier League sack race: Nuno and Frank in a grim race to the bottom",
      "Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Frank explained why he thinks his side has deserved more points from their recent matches. He said: “I think the last five games we played, it has been consistent, good, competitive performances and that’s what you need in a long season.",
      "“Those five games should have given us more than the five points we got. Probably eight, nine, 10 points. That’s what we are focusing on.",
      "“It is my job to deal with scrutiny. I will take all the questions and the blame. It is also my job to look through everything and look through the defeat last night. It was emotional but in many ways it was good and we deserve more.",
      "“We need to keep doing that. The last two games should have got us four points maybe more.”",
      "Frank will hope that there is a response from this side when they face Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Saturday and beyond, with a report from journalsit Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claiming the club is ‘growing increasingly alarmed and considering all options’.",
      "MORE SPURS COVERAGE ON F365…\n* Spurs to sack Frank as Rosenior rues forced Chelsea promotion on perfect night for Arsenal\n* Tottenham small-time it again after encouraging start as Thomas Frank shuffles closer to the exit\n* Real Madrid want Tottenham defender as Spurs ‘look to make a game-changing signing in attack’",
      "It is also explained that the head coach ‘faces a pivotal period to avoid the sack’: ‘Tottenham’s upcoming fixtures are seen as make-or-break for Frank. Next up is a home FA Cup third-round tie against in-form Aston Villa this weekend, followed by a crucial Premier League clash with West Ham United at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on January 17.",
      "‘Following those is a Champions League encounter with Borussia Dortmund on January 20 – three home games that sources describe as “pivotal” in determining the 52-year-old’s immediate future.’",
      "Another report from TEAMtalk claims current Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi is Tottenham’s ‘top target’ to replace Frank, though he would ‘favour’ a move to Man Utd if they also made an ‘approach’.",
      "A source for the outlet said: “He’s flattered by Tottenham’s interest, but United would likely be priority.”",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank has spoken of Cristian Romero after the club captain attacked the board and higher ups.",
      "It’s a race between Nuno Espirito Santo and Thomas Frank to see who can get sacked first. We’re trying to work out how they can both lose.",
      "According to reports, a Tottenham Hotspur chief has ‘demanded’ head coach Thomas Frank to be sacked after the 3-2 loss against AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Thomas Frank has lost another football match while holding an Arsenal cup. Who might replace him at Spurs?",
      "Arsenal were the biggest winners of the night, but there’s no bigger loser than Thomas Frank, who should be sacked after Dr Tottenham’s Bournemouth visit.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is very interested in becoming the next permanent manager of Manchester United."

      "The Old Trafford to Italy route is a well-trodden one, with Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund both at Napoli and Roma could become another home to an ex-United player.",
      "According to transfer reporter Romano, Roma have reignited their interest in the Dutchman and could go for a move in January.",

      "“But at the moment for Man United, still nothing imminent. Of course, now we are waiting for the new manager at the moment, and we will understand what’s likely to do in the January window.”",
      "Given the turbulence at the club in the manager’s role, a January move would seem unlikely, with any new boss presumably keen to have a say as to whether they want Zirkzee to stick around.",
      "Pre-Ruben Amorim’s sacking, there were reports that Zirkzee had grown frustrated with the Portuguese boss and was seeking a move away.",
      "Romano reported at the time that Roma were looking for a loan with an obligation to buy deal, but that would only be sanctioned should they find a replacement.",
      "“What I’m told is that Man Utd will only approve this solution for Zirkzee to leave the club if they can get a replacement.",
      "“So Man Utd have started exploring the market again after they failed to reach an agreement with Antoine Semenyo.",

      "Currently on the books, United are limited in their central striker options with Benjamin Sesko the only experienced option. Both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo can play there though while Chido Obi and Shea Lacey are both youngsters at 18 years old.",

      "Rodrygo has been linked with every Big Six club at some point in the past year as he has fallen out of favour at the Bernabeu, with Man Utd possibly facing competition from Arsenal, Liverpool and others for his services.",
      "That would be the case if this entire report were not a load of utter nonsense, of course, which it is.",
      "Fabrizio Romano is far more reliable on these matters, and his latest update hints at Man Utd looking closer to home for their next permanent manager.",
      "He said: “Manchester United will immediately start internal conversations about their future head coach while the caretaker is in place,” Romano said.",
      "“One key factor will be Premier League experience. The club want someone who can make an instant impact and handle the pressure of this role.",
      "“Trusting young players and playing quality football will also be essential parts of the project, especially for INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "“You will hear many names linked to this job, but the club know they cannot afford another mistake after what happened with Amorim.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the latest on Rodrygo’s future amid rumours Arsenal have made an offer for the Brazil international.",

When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, whose latest crime is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of the boardroom suits. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, and one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",

      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",

      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",

But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "Arsenal next, and a non-zero chance that any repeat of the Etihad capitulation in the face of the only compellingly good team in the league could spell the end.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",

      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated.

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 20 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and basically had nothing to do v Palace.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save v Fulham.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in. Though he’s hardly convincing…",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save v Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Will be lucky to keep his place after the FA Cup game week.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save.",

      "FA Cup third-round weekend is always a big one, and even more so with all the new managers and interims, and still also somehow Thomas Frank.",

Though neither of them in retrospect has turned out well. But I continue undaunted. So let me share with you why none of this is doom and gloom.",
      "It turns out this is a good year to be a bit rubbish, as there are 17 teams that are vying to be crisis clubs on any given weekend. (The goal difference column makes interesting reading). So we are still somehow knocking on the Champions League spots and as I see it, 2 out of United, Liverpool and Chelsea are likely to make it. It’s anybody’s guess how that pans out. But I’d give each club equal chance at this point which means we have a 66% shot at CL.",
      "There is a constant drumbeat about how the players aren’t good enough and why the squad needs another x windows to sort out. This is rubbish, imho. This is a group of players who are definitely good enough to get into the top 5 of the league. United have had a history of late of somehow devaluing players and seeing them shine elsewhere. Largely because they didn’t fit the system and were being played out of position (McTominay), or just worn down by the lack of support and success (Rashford, Hojlund). Players were also encouraged to become d*ckheads (Garnacho/ Sancho) rather than buckle down and perform.",
      "Solskjaer’s term ended badly but there were good things about it – much like this year, we did well against the big teams playing a counterattacking style, and then with Bruno we were also able to break down deep lying defences. It all fell apart in trying to accommodate Ronaldo who liked to stay up further and Maguire, who needs to play deep.",
      "Failure isn’t the monster everybody makes it out to be. Failure without learning is where the problem is. As long as the Ineos group learn from their mistakes, and there is a sense of progression, I’m happy enough. Transfers have definitely been more on the money in the past year and this year we obviously have specific problems that are fixable. We’ve done badly against the bottom half of teams, and we have conceded too many goals despite the 3 at the back structure. I feel both of these can be addressed with some tactical flexibility and game management.",
      "Lastly, none of this would be a problem if Amorim had won 3 more matches – wins against Everton, West Ham, and Wolves – all 3 very winnable games would have removed all the swirling questions and issues, and it feels a little bit like Amorim chose to die on his formation hill – and that’s a shame because no manager can survive in the long term without tactical flexibility. Hopefully that’s something Amorim has taken away from this experience.",
      "What United need to learn perhaps is that before we aim for winning the league, we should aim for a couple of years of consistently finishing in the top 4 and building a squad capable of challenging on multiple fronts. If Solskjaer or the next manager can get us there over the next 3 years and then we get in somebody for a big push that probably is a better idea than sitting in 12th place and dreaming about winning the title.\nVed Sen, Optimistically, MUFC",

      "1. In August/September, they were hailed as “mentality monsters” as they won a succession of tight games in injury time or the last 10 minutes of normal time. Sign of champions, they’ll be unbeatable when they click, etc.",
      "2. Things turned, they lost a slew of games and conceded some late goals in the process. Turns out they’d been papering over the cracks and their luck had to run out some time. Directly contradicts the above, but everyone got a pass for ever thinking that.",
      "3. The crap run dragged on longer than expected, some people attributed it to grief while others focused on the form of their £400k-per-week totems falling off a cliff. New signings had been almost uniformly shit for months, so the scrutiny turned to Slot and how he was on borrowed time. Manager is a fraud, last season an aberration, can’t handle adversity, etc. etc.",
      "4. Salah decided to give a “me me meeeee” interview, got rightly dropped, promptly f*cked off to AFCON. One problem temporarily out of the picture, Liverpool’s form stabilised slightly after that, and they now sit atop the pile of mush occupying 4th-14th in the table. Cue the “transitional period” guff as the above rationales fade from relevance and fans scramble to explain the current state of affairs, which feels quite sterile from afar.",
      "In the space of less than 5 months this team has tumbled from heavy odds title favourites to distant also-rans, and to my eyes at least it’s because of a series of questionable decisions that have directly impacted them on the pitch. Throwing crazy money at Van Dijk and Salah, buying a pair of expensive full-backs who can’t defend, spunking £200m on strikers and neglecting more pressing needs in the squad.",
      "None of those things are markers of a club in transition whatsoever. They’re expensive, flawed decisions which were intended to stand on the league’s throat from a position of strength. The players who came in were all ready-made first teamers with the exception of Leoni. They were supposed to strengthen and refresh the squad, not form the foundation of a long-term rebuild. The players who left were also sold by choice, intended to be swapped out for incoming upgrades.",
      "When that approach backfires, you don’t get to retreat behind a wall of your own construction that you’ve covered in graffiti proclaiming that last season’s success only prolonged the inevitable after Klopp left. Trying to protect yourself from the slings and arrows from other fans with bull like that only makes you look childish. This isn’t a transition, it was fully intended to be a progression. You don’t have to like the direction of travel, and right now I wouldn’t blame Liverpool fans for that. But stop trying to sell the rest of us an absolute pup.\nKeith Reilly",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "But try as he might, even with five positive and sensible substitutions, an attacking gameplan and the revitalisation of Benjamin Sesko, this is a club currently lacking fortune almost as much as it is intelligent thought and vague levels of competence.",
      "Fletcher wanted “to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball, don’t hide,” and it’s difficult to pinpoint anyone who specifically failed on those fronts. Casemiro and Lisandro Martinez could have done far better for the Burnley goals but it was an approach and display which, nine times out of ten, would have delivered a victory.",
      "This simply happened to be the one, and the first time a Ferguson disciple turned interim manager has failed to win their first game.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "Ryan Giggs, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy all proudly discussed having consulted Ferguson over their caretakership, all said the right things about passion, bravery, imagination and expression, and all savoured vibe-restoring, feel-good victories from the dugout as the support chanted their name again to escape the misery of the prior months.",
      "Fletcher was certainly embraced by the travelling fans as the latest saviour temporarily promoted from the former players’ WhatsApp group, but will have noted how Solskjaer and Carrick also had their songs given a run-out during a third straight draw against a team in the bottom five.",
      "Those who will ultimately decide which legend is pestered over tactics for the next four months by Jason Wilcox might have preferred a clearer indication of the populist choice.",
      "And this really did little to boost or block Fletcher’s candidacy. A good performance produced a poor result, neither of which really moves the needle sufficiently for or against him.",
      "The goals conceded were a deflected cross and a wonderful individual effort. The goals scored were the result of smart moves, the first a direct consequence of Fletcher’s half-time redeployment of Bruno Fernandes on the right. Two wrongs don’t make a right and 2-2 probably doesn’t extend this spell past one more game at most.",
      "Thus Manchester United, despite slipping below a quite absurd Newcastle team, are back precisely where they started. With the next appointment being purely for the rest of this season it is tough to imagine how either Solskjaer or Carrick set themselves apart from the other when both are seeking the counsel and advice of the same 84-year-old elephant in every room at Old Trafford and Carrington, both will be signing from the same hymn sheet about identity and culture, and both can point to past ship-steadying exploits, achieved with a great many of these players.",
      "It is a decision which can likely be put off past the weekend, when Brighton visit in the FA Cup. There lies the last opportunity for Manchester United to adorn this season with a trophy, but beyond that are their next two Premier League opponents: Manchester City and Arsenal on January 17 and 25 respectively.",
      "There is still plenty to play for, still a Champions League place to secure and a season to stabilise. Fletcher’s chance to make a compelling argument that he should be trusted with those responsibilities has passed; Manchester United have a week or so to make a decision they have already proven they cannot be trusted with.",

      "United are searching for a new manager after sacking Ruben Amorim on Monday, with Palace boss Glasner among the favourites.",
      "The Premier League giants are expected to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season before naming Amorim’s permanent successor, with former manager and club legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer expected to take charge in the short term.",
      "Amorim was the Red Devils’ seventh – and worst – managerial appointment since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "He led the club to an all-time low 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season and leaves them currently sixth in the table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.",
      "Solskjaer is expected to come in to steady the ship and help United qualify for the Champions League. However, when the summer arrives, a permanent boss will be tasked with the poisoned chalice of managing at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim was the first appointment made by the club’s new hierarchy led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who backed the Portuguese coach with over £200 million in transfer funds last summer despite an abysmal 2024/25 campaign.",
      "It remains unclear whether Ratcliffe will commit further significant investment for Amorim’s successor. If the new manager is asked to work with the existing squad rather than being heavily backed in the market, the British billionaire could struggle to attract his top target.",
      "The club’s number-one target is reportedly Glasner, who led Crystal Palace to the FA Cup last season, the first major trophy in the club’s history.",
      "The Austrian has done an outstanding job at Selhurst Park but has been outspoken about the club’s ownership and lack of backing in the transfer market.",
      "With this in mind, former Everton, Aston Villa, and Aberdeen chief executive Wyness is not convinced that Glasner would accept the Old Trafford post.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: New Man United manager ‘agreement reached’ as past Solskjaer sympathises with present Amorim",
      "Speaking to Football Insider’s Inside Track podcast, he said: “Is there another two or three hundred million for him to get the squad in the way that he wants to do it now? They’ll say they want a coach rather than a manager.",
      "“That was one of the big things with Amorim, which is open for debate. I knew he was coming in basically as a coach, I’m pretty sure about that. But what will Glasner want to do? No doubt he can be more flexible and he can definitely bring something slightly different in terms of the way he’s going to manage things. But will he be happy with the squad he’s got or is he just going to accept the Man United job and say, this is what you’ve got, go on and manage it?",
      "“It’s a whole different Man United proposition, rather than coming in as it used to be, getting the big job at Man United, having money to put your own imprint on the club.",
      "“Glasner does seem favourite at the moment. There’s a number of other names in the hat, but still, if I’m Oliver Glasner, I’ve got to think, is this really the Man United club that I want to go to?",
      "“Now, if they don’t get Champions League again, Glasner might be thinking twice as well. So if he’s the first choice, they may not get it and that’s the reality of where Man United are right now.”",

      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",

      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "They are without a win so far this year and they've been hit with injuries to key players. Central defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias and winger Savinho have sufferred significant injuries. John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",

I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",

      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",

      "Silva reckons this is Wilson's \"best moment\" of his career and it's hard to argue. Of course there have been other standout moments for him in a Fulham shirt but Silva noted how the pair had a conversation last season to help try to draw out these kind of consistently impactful performances.",

      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",

      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 22:11, UK",
      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."

      "Man Utd must appoint a manager who fits with their footballing DNA, according to Gary Neville, but would fit the bill? Between the Lines breaks down the side's stylistic profile under Sir Alex Ferguson and ranks the managers whose approaches are most similar",
      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 11:16, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Michael Carrick also make our top 10.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is 11th and Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 12th - just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Recently-axed Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who has also been linked, sits 20th in our list, with a suitability score of 67.52 out of 100.",
