      "Manchester United may be homing in a potential solution to one positional conundrum that's been plaguing the squad for some time now. That's after the player in question admitted it would be a \"dream\" to join the Red Devils one day.",
      "Ruben Amorim is coming off the back of a transfer window that has had a very positive impact at United. So much so that Sir Alex Ferguson has come out voicing his approval for one signing in particular.",
      "Crystal Palace full-back Daniel Munoz has put his hand up as a potential future signing for Amorim after saying it would be a \"dream come true\" to play for United. The Colombian is enjoying a superb sophomore season at Selhurst Park but recently included the Red Devils among his list of ideal transfer destinations.",
      "\"First of all, I think there’s a lot of talk about one club or another,\" he told AS. \"If you ask me, it would be a dream come true to play for one of these clubs, whether it’s Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.\"",
      "There can be no more certain a gesture that a player would be receptive to a transfer inquiry. And given United's issues filling the right wing-back slot as Amorim's system demands, Munoz could be an ideal addition.",
      "Amad Diallo is currently occupying the role, while Noussair Mazraoui and Digo Dalot have offered support there when fit. Even prior to Amorim's arrival, there was debate as to whether the right side of the defence had the talent required.",
      "Though on the older side of United's usual transfer policy, that would in theory reduce the fee Palace might expect for Munoz. And after excelling under Oliver Glasner, the former Genk talisman could be an understated answer to one of the Red Devils' long-term dilemmas.",
      "\"I think I’m working towards that,\" added Munoz before hinting he'd be open to a mid-season switch. \"I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because it’s a dream of mine to get there.",
      "\"Right now I’m focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. If you ask me, I don’t have any concrete information that any of these clubs are interested in me.",
      "\"My focus is on Crystal Palace; we’ll see when the winter transfer window gets closer. Right now, I’m fully focused on these two matches with the national team.\"",
      "Amid the swell of fresh faces that arrived at Old Trafford over the summer, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha stick out as some of the more impressive. The pair formed part of a £200million attacking makeover alongside Benjamin Sesko, and fans have been largely impressed by their impact to date.",
      "However, Ferguson's attention was more focused on the opposite end of the field after addressing the new arrival that has left the biggest mark. And the United great has been thrilled by the upgrade effect Senne Lammens has had between the posts.",
      "\"There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,\" he told Raceday RTV. \"Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they’ve added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - the signs are getting better.",
      "\"I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they’ll enjoy it now.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck has been tipped as the ideal mentor for new signing Benjamin Sesko. The Red Devils splashed out on their attack during the summer transfer window, bringing in Premier League-tested talents Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They also made a significant investment in the European market by snapping up former RB Leipzig forward Sesko, beating off competition from Newcastle United. So far this season, the Slovenian international has netted two goals and provided one assist in his 12 appearances across all competitions.",
      "However, Sesko hit a bump in the road in his last match before the international break - a 2-2 stalemate away at Tottenham - where he was brought on as a second-half substitute only to be quickly taken off due to a suspected knee injury. Consequently, the 22-year-old did not join his national team and has spent the break working towards regaining his fitness.",
      "Reports this week suggest the striker is still a few weeks away from making a comeback, meaning he's likely to sit out several crucial matches after the international break. As the January transfer window looms, rumours about potential new arrivals are naturally gaining momentum.",
      "One name that has been loosely associated with a move to Old Trafford is ex-striker Welbeck, and pundit Don Hutchison reckons the Brighton forward would be the perfect guide for Sesko as he adjusts to the English top tier.",
      "\"I mean, it'd be a brilliant fit,\" Hutchison said in an interview with SportCasting. \"He'd be a fantastic signing because Danny Welbeck's one of those players where, if he went back to Man United, it would be like when Jonny Evans returned.",
      "\"When Jonny Evans went back there a couple of years ago, he was happy to be a sort of mentor inside the dressing room. He was happy to be a mentor to the players that were playing. He was happy to play his part when needed. He was happy to be on the bench.",
      "\"I think Danny Welbeck going to Man United would be a really good fit in terms of he can still play, he can still score goals, he's still really fit. But he would still have the attitude where it would be a fantastic move forward, being back at Man United with the knowledge that he'd be mentoring the likes of Sesko. I think it would be a perfect move.\"",
      "Welbeck progressed through United's academy system and clocked up more than 140 first-team outings before his switch to Arsenal in 2014.",
      "He subsequently had a stint at Watford prior to his Brighton move in 2020, where he's experienced a career revival - especially this campaign, netting six times in 11 Premier League matches to date.",
      "This wouldn't be the first occasion the 34-year-old has been touted for a stunning Old Trafford comeback, with speculation also surfacing around this period last year.",
      "However, at present, there's no solid evidence suggesting United are plotting a swoop for the striker.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chelsea summer signing Alejandro Garnacho has barely had time to settle in before rumours have started swirling that his position could be under threat. And the potential competition is none other than Marcus Rashford.",
      "Both players experienced their own forms of exile at Manchester United last season before departing Old Trafford in the summer. Garnacho, 21, completed a bargain £40million move to Stamford Bridge, while 28-year-old Rashford was loaned out to Barcelona.",
      "Garnacho has been in the starting line-up for Chelsea's last five Premier League matches and assisted two of their three goals in a victory over Wolves just prior to the international break. However, if Rashford were to join the Blues, Garnacho's spot would immediately be up for grabs.",
      "This scenario is becoming increasingly likely as Rashford's brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, is reported to have held talks with Chelsea. El Nacional claims Rashford's representative was in London for negotiations, while Tottenham are also said to be in discussions.",
      "Barcelona hold first-refusal rights on Rashford and can sign him permanently next summer for a fee of around £28m. The player has seen a revival in Spain and appears to be worth the price tag after contributing 15 direct goal contributions (six goals, nine assists) in only 16 appearances under Hansi Flick.",
      "The England forward is on track to hit double figures for the first time since his 30-goal haul under Erik ten Hag in the 2022/23 season. However, United might be hoping Barca don't make his signing permanent, knowing they could command a higher fee in today's market.",
      "Rumours are swirling that Rashford has had enough of life at United, particularly with the prospect of playing under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. Yet, a return to Premier League action isn't out of the question if Chelsea decide to pursue their interest.",
      "Garnacho used the tension between Rashford and United to engineer his own departure from the club earlier this year. The Argentine star posted a photo of himself donning Rashford's Aston Villa shirt in June, just as Rashford was wrapping up a six-month loan spell in Birmingham.",
      "This not-so-subtle hint caused an uproar among many United supporters and was seen as a clear signal he wanted out of United. Garnacho got his wish, but it's somewhat ironic Rashford could now disrupt his rise in west London.",
      "Enzo Maresca seems to be a big admirer of Garnacho's talent and has given him more responsibility in the starting line-up recently. Cole Palmer's recent injury problems have worked in his favour, although he could find himself back on the bench once the Englishman is fit again.",
      "Rashford's impressive form at Barcelona hasn't gone unnoticed by England boss Thomas Tuchel, who brought the forward back into the starting line-up for the recent 2-0 victory over Serbia. Meanwhile, Garnacho has been overlooked by Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni and is one year removed from his last international appearance.",
      "While United would ideally want to get the highest possible price for Rashford if he were to leave, selling to a direct competitor comes with its own risks. And this could be one reunion that Garnacho might prefer to avoid if it were to jeopardise his position at Chelsea.",

      "Rashford entered the United academy at merely seven years old. A native of the city, he is a genuine Mancunian and swiftly became a supporters' favourite at Old Trafford as he progressed into the senior side. He rapidly became not just one of the most prominent figures in Manchester, but a significant presence on the world stage.",
      "His disagreement with Amorim was extensively reported, and his loan period at Aston Villa indicated a desire to distance himself from the club where he developed.",

      "They wrote: \"Around his new club Rashford is said to be more shy and reserved, while his introduction in August seemed almost deliberately low-key. Those close to Rashford insist this was how he wanted it, the attention dialled down and the noise put on mute.",
      "\"Yamal is the real star at Barcelona, their teenage sensation whose personal life makes headlines and whose form and fitness spin the wheel of national debate.\"",
      "Despite Rashford's stellar performances for Barcelona, United bosses are reportedly sticking to their long-term plan for the England star.",
      "The Red Devils are said to be hopeful that the Spanish giants will activate the £26m buy-out clause in Rashford's contract.",
      "Given the Manchester-born forward's impressive form, it seems increasingly likely that this will happen.",

      "Former Premier League star Kieron Dyer has revealed how he agreed to \"kick up some noise\" at Newcastle United in his bid to secure a move to Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. Dyer was at his brilliant best at St. James' Park when Ferguson came calling - quite literally.",
      "The Old Trafford legend was one of numerous bosses who tried to sign Dyer during his early days playing in England's top flight. The ex-midfielder narrowly missed out on Premier League promotion with Ipswich Town in 1999 when a host of top clubs were chasing his signature.",
      "Dyer was quizzed about which sides were keen to snap him up from Ipswich and told the Open Goal podcast: \"Juventus, I know Arsenal, I know Newcastle because Ruud Gullit rung me, I know Leeds because David O'Leary rung me, I know West Ham because Harry Redknapp rung me all when I'm in Ayia Napa, steaming, so I'm thinking, 'What a time to ring!'",
      "\"Everyone talks about your journey but what is so great is taking your friends on the journey with you. Can you imagine, I've got Ruud Gullit on the phone [in front of my friends] and I'm going, 'it's Ruud!'\"",
      "Regarding Ferguson's pursuit of the player, Dyer disclosed just how far the Scot went to test his ambition for the move. And Dyer, who was already at Newcastle by then, was so excited by the prospect that he agreed to help his suitors if it meant joining forces at Old Trafford.",
      "\"There was a time with Man United when I was at Newcastle and my agent rings me and goes, 'I'm now putting you on speaker phone,'\" he continued. \"I'm at the airport at New York me and Titus [Bramble] are coming back to England.",
      "\"[My agent] says, 'You're now going to hear a few voices', the first voice was Pini Zahavi who was the 'super agent', he was Rio [Ferdinand's] agent then the next voice was, 'Hi Kieron, it's Sir Alex,' so I'm like [gestures mouthing Sir Alex Ferguson while pointing at the phone].",
      "\"He said, 'I just want you to answer me two questions, first is do you want to come and play for Manchester United?' I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
      "\"The second was, 'If [Newcastle] don't accept the bid will you go and kick up some noise?' Then I was like, 'Yeah, yeah,' and that was it, he just hung up the phone.\"",
      "Hardly the kind of encouraging reaction Dyer might have anticipated after confirming he'd commit one of football's most heinous crimes. Yet the gaffer may well have been cautious about appearing overly committed by offering a glowing endorsement of Dyer's willingness.",
      "Ultimately, the transfer fell through. United tabled a £15million offer for Dyer but saw their approach knocked back when they were unwilling to match Newcastle's reported £25m asking price. He racked up 250 appearances for the Magpies, even earning a spot in the Premier League Team of the Year after the 2002/03 campaign.",
      "Dyer later donned the jerseys of QPR and Middlesbrough before hanging up his boots at the Riverside in 2013. With no major silverware to his name from his playing career, he might wonder whether things would have been different had he secured that move to United all those years ago.",

      "Former Newcastle United and Manchester United midfielder Liam O'Brien has shared a memory of the moment he left Sir Alex Ferguson speechless after announcing his departure from United to join Newcastle in 1988.",
      "The former Republic of Ireland star, who was seeking additional security for his family, turned down a contract offer from United to make the move. In his new book 'Pass Master', O'Brien delves into the challenges faced by professional footballers in the 80s and how even being a star at Old Trafford didn't guarantee a bright future.",
      "O'Brien went on to become a legend at Newcastle, scoring memorable goals against Sunderland at Roker Park and playing a crucial role in Kevin Keegan's Entertainers. However, after rejecting Fergie's offer of just £400 per week, O'Brien - in the era before football agents - found himself meeting Newcastle coaches Willie McFaul and Colin Suggett for transfer discussions a service station, sealing the deal beside the motorway.",
      "But it was when he broke the news to Ferguson that the legendary Man United boss gave him a piece of his mind over the phone. Reflecting on the moment he confirmed his move to Newcastle, O'Brien said: \"I didn't expect him to be impressed with the news I had to tell him.",
      "\"I have something to tell you,' I said. 'I'm after signing for Newcastle United.' There was a moment of silence.",
      "\"A pregnant pause. He wasn't one bit impressed. He went through me. Who did I think I was walking out of a club like Manchester United?",
      "\"After he had his say, the phone went dead. Suddenly.",
      "\"It took some time for Alex Ferguson to talk to me again. When I met him a few months later, he didn't speak. Eventually, the ice did thaw – although it took a couple of years.\"",
      "\"There were suggestions that Alex and myself had this big bust-up before I left Old Trafford but that wasn't the case. There was no big row.",
      "\"Did I have regrets that I left Man United – especially considering what they achieved later under Ferguson? No, I didn't and don't now, all these years later.\"",
      "O'Brien will always be remembered as a key player in Newcastle's transformation from narrowly avoiding relegation in Division Two to competing in Europe within two years. The former midfielder was a fan favourite, and he still speaks passionately about Sir John Hall's vision that nearly brought the Premier League title to the Magpies.",
      "Speaking to Chronicle Live, O'Brien said: \"Sir John Hall and Kevin Keegan drove it and the stadium shot up from old terraces to all-seater. There's a video somewhere of Sir John with one of those time capsules burying it into the ground.",
      "\"That was when the Leazes End was being built and he said: 'In 100 years time when this is knocked down they'll find this and people will wonder what it was all about'.",
      "\"But it happened so quickly. The stadium is now magnificent. The atmosphere is brilliant, but that was the start of it.",
      "\"Outsiders questioned Kevin Keegan coming in but the Newcastle fans already adored him for what he did as a player.",
      "\"He was a man coming into the club who had not managed and been living in Marbella! He didn't know any of the players to be honest. He was taking a massive gamble really, if it hadn't worked out for him it was his career.",
      "\"When he came in, it could not have gone better. We staved off relegation in the old Second Division then the next year we couldn't believe how well we started. Then it just went from there, and before you knew it Newcastle were in Europe.\"",
      "O'Brien left Newcastle in 1994 for Tranmere Rovers but had already made his mark on Tyneside. His new book features a photograph of Keegan embracing the Irishman at Filbert Street moments after a 2-1 victory in 1992 that guaranteed the club's Second Division status and set the stage for future seasons.",
      "The former Toon midfielder recalled: \"We went into that game at Filbert Street knowing we needed a win and couldn't afford to lose it. We didn't know what would happen to us if he we lost.",
      "\"So there was a lot of tension and nerves at Filbert Street between the players. We actually conceded a late goal and didn't know what it would mean for us.",
      "\"But luckily enough Steve Walsh scored an own goal. It caused all the fans to run on the pitch.",
      "\"We were worried that the game would get abandoned because time wasn't quite up but in the end the result stood, we stayed up and the rest is history.\"",
      "Despite his frosty departure from Old Trafford under Ferguson, O'Brien recalls a pivotal moment when the legendary United boss showed him crucial support during what felt like his darkest hour. Following a red card in a televised match against Southampton - during an era when live football was far less common on British screens - O'Brien's challenge on Mark Dennis came under intense scrutiny.",
      "The early dismissal even prompted Bobby Charlton to burst into the dressing room and tear strips off him, though Ferguson proved more sympathetic on the team coach. O'Brien said: \"I played on ITV against Southampton. Sir Alex Ferguson gave me my debut for Man United down at the Dell.",
      "\"In Ireland, it was the first time I think live football had been on from England, so all my friends and family were watching. I got told to watch out for Mark Dennis in midfield and that he was 'nasty'.",
      "\"I went in for a tackle and Dennis came off worse, I thought it would be a yellow card, back in the day you'd get a caution. Then the ref pulled out the red card after 85 seconds! I went back to the dressing room knowing everybody had been watching at home.",
      "\"It brings you to a dark place and you wonder how things will go for you at a club like Man United. Fergie actually thought I'd insulted the ref.",
      "\"He watched the video back with me on the team bus. But he didn't fine me because he knew it was the wrong decision.",
      "\"All managers have good sides and bad sides. You have to show some type of ruthlessness to be a manager. But Fergie cared about his players first. He was like Keegan and would always back his players.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "In the morning, it is said that Frank met with Ineos chief Ratcliffe in a London garage, before holding talks with Chelsea in the lavish Mayfair Hotel overlooking Hyde Park. In the end, however, Frank opted to stay on with Brentford for another season, with United appointing Ruben Amorim in the wake of Ten Hag's dismissal in the November, while Chelsea opted to put their faith in Enzo Maresca.",
      "However, Frank told the publication that he was left feeling in awe at the prospect of even speaking with two titans of world football. He explained: \"I know I didn't get either job, but it was still huge.",
      "\"I remember walking through Battersea Park between the two interviews and thinking, 'Thomas Frank from f***ing Frederiksværk - am I really experiencing this?'\"",
      "After a humble playing career with Frederiksværk between 1995 and 2004, Frank transitioned into the world of football management in 2008, taking up tenure with his nation's U16 set-up. From there, he climbed through the ranks to Denmark U17 and U19, before parting ways with the international game to manage Brondby in 2013.",
      "Frank lasted just three years with the club before he resigned after it came about that the club's chairman, Jan Bech Andersen, had been criticising him via an anonymous profile on a fan forum site. A two year break from football then ensued, before he landed a role with Brentford.",
      "A Championship team at the time, Frank led the side to Premier League football in 2021 as a result of winning the play-off final with a convincing 2-0 triumph of Swansea City.",
      "While many newly-promoted teams have faced relegation the year after achieving promotion as a result of struggling to adapt to top flight football, Frank managed to not only retain Brentford's place in the Premier League in the years that followed, but turned the team into genuine stalwarts - finishing 10th last term.",
      "However, the 52-year-old's time at the Gtech Community Stadium drew to a close this summer. Frank found himself linked with taking up tenure with Tottenham soon after the departure of Ange Postecoglou, before he was finally unveiled as the club's new head coach on June 12.",
      "Despite Spurs suffering a 17th-place finish in the Premier League last season under Postecoglou, it appears as though the club is now breathing a new lease of life under Frank's reign. As it stands, the Lilywhites currently sit fifth in the league table after 11 matches, with five wins, three draws and three losses to show for their efforts.",
      "They are also unbeaten in Europe at present, with wins over Villarreal and Copenhagen, as well as draws with Bodo/Glimt to their name in the Champions League. Frank and his side will hope to pick up where they left off when Premier League action returns next weekend, although there may be a titan task awaiting them.",
      "That's because Spurs next face Mikel Arteta's Arsenal on Sunday, November 23. The Gunners currently occupy first-place in the league standings, eight points clear of Tottenham and unbeaten in their last eight top flight outings.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Liverpool and Manchester United may have an added advantage over their Premier League rivals when the international break comes to an end. The clubs will return to top-flight action next weekend as the final two-week hiatus of the calendar year draws to a close.",
      "Liverpool have seen their title hopes severely dented over the last few weeks with five defeats across their last six Premier League matches. United have climbed up to seventh place in the table and will have ambitions of qualifying for the Champions League this term.",
      "The return of top-flight football will see both Liverpool and United be determined to return to winning ways, having failed to secure all three points in their previous fixtures. The upcoming run of matches could offer both clubs a major boost.",
      "United will play teams that are currently 13th (Everton), 10th (Crystal Palace), 18th (West Ham), 20th (Wolves) and ninth (Bournemouth) across their next five fixtures. Liverpool's fixture list is marginally easier, with the reigning champions taking on teams in 19th (Nottingham Forest), 18th (West Ham), fourth (Sunderland), 16th (Leeds United) and 11th (Brighton).",
      "This weekend will see Liverpool take on 19th-placed Forest at Anfield, which will also see former Everton manager Sean Dyche return to Merseyside. United will also take on a Merseyside club as they host Everton in Monday Night Football, a game which will see former Red Devils boss David Moyes return to Manchester to be in the opposition dugout at Old Trafford.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo was named the Premier League's Player of the Month for October. It came as no surprise with Manchester United a team on the rise as they embark on a five-match unbeaten run - which included three successive wins.",
      "Mbeumo was a huge hit at Brentford and has quickly been able to translate that form following his summer move. He is more than paying back his £70million fee as he continues to impress in the final third.",
      "The Cameroon international scored in two of United's three wins. It took him just two minutes to score against Liverpool at Anfield and then notched a brace in the 4-2 win over Brighton. His efforts have now earned individual recognition and he becomes the second United player to win the award in 2025 - following Bruno Fernandes.",
      "But take a look down the list of names to excel in a Premier League month and you'll see some rogue names - some of whom had very short periods in the sun.",
      "Yes across the competitions history there's been several multiple winners. Sergio Aguero, Harry Kane and Mo Salah have claimed it seven times. Cristiano Ronaldo and Steven Gerrard six.",
      "It was a short stint in the Covid-impacted season that basically earned the Newcastle ace his move to St James' Park following a stellar loan stint from Arsenal. The midfielder turned into a goal-getting machine - finding the net in seven games on the bounce when he played. His run began in April and kept going until the end of the season with his goals helping the Magpies to win four of their final seven games.",
      "Once upon a time he was banging on the door to be England's goalkeeper - and that was owing to some of the form he showed whilst at Southampton. Forster had made a comeback from injury and kept a club record six consecutive clean sheets for the Saints - three of which - against Arsenal, West Ham and Swansea - fell in February to secure seven points.",
      "He had quite the purple patch and it helped West Ham secure a memorable win over Manchester City at Upton Park. The striker helped the Hammers bag three wins out of three in the month - the others coming against QPR and Burnley. He scored in all three victories and had six goals from six starts. Sakho's header against City proving the match-winner as they edged out the champions 2-1.",
      "Chelsea had wanted to sign the Portuguese playmaker in 2004 after he inspired Porto to Champions League glory. They got him four years later after he opted to join Barcelona instead, but he did begin with a bang. Deco masterminded a 4-0 win over Portsmouth on the opening day - scoring a cracker. He also came up with the match winner against Wigan a week later - but that would be as good as his Chelsea career got.",
      "Another ex-Chelsea man but he needed to head out to Birmingham City to make his mark in the Premier League. The Finnish frontman enjoyed the season of his career in 2003/04 - scoring 19 times in all competitions as he outscored the likes of Michael Owen. In March he would score six times - which included braces against Middlesbrough and Leeds.",
      "The man from Costa Rica made his name in England whilst with Derby and began impressively in the 1997/98 campaign. The striker was in stunning form during the month and was involved in all five of Derby’s league goals - He laid on both of Francesco Baiano’s goals in the Rams’ 2-1 victory at Leicester. Wanchope remained integral as Derby drew 2-2 against United at Pride Park - scoring to put them ahead for a period. He also set up Baiano again as Derby drew 1-1 with Wimbledon.",

      "Manchester United supporters will have been delighted to witness Casemiro's latest Brazil masterclass as the midfielder battles to secure his place in Carlo Ancelotti's future plans. The midfield magician rolled back the years as he found the net during a 2-0 friendly triumph over Senegal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Both he and Chelsea winger Estevao were on target as the Selecao continue their upward trajectory under former Real Madrid boss Ancelotti. It's looking increasingly likely Casemiro will have a crucial part to play at the 2026 World Cup, which suggests he was right to turn down a summer reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Goal reported in September that the South American rejected the opportunity to link back up with his old Real Madrid team-mate at Al-Nassr. The Saudi Pro League outfit allegedly made an attempt to recruit Casemiro in the summer, only for him to spurn their advances and remain at United, feeling his chances of landing a World Cup spot were best served at Old Trafford.",
      "The burning question for Ruben Amorim is whether Casemiro will still be at United when the World Cup comes around, with his deal set to run out next summer. The club have the option to activate a 12-month extension to his terms, and Casemiro has been building a compelling argument despite his staggering £350,000-a-week wages.",
      "Media outlets in his homeland have been singing his praises following another outstanding showings for his country, with several now backing him to secure a spot in Ancelotti's squad for next summer's World Cup. According to reports in Brazil, his most recent outing demonstrated he \"has evolved\" at this advanced stage of his career while also emerging as his team's \"main leader\".",
      "\"There is no longer any reason to divide the midfield, as was done in Brazil in recent decades, between the number five, number eight and number 10 shirts,\" read one report in Folha de Sao Paulo. \"They blend together. As [Jurgen] Klopp, former Liverpool coach, said, more important than a good, classic number 10 is recovering the ball closer to the opponent's goal.",
      "\"Even better is having both options, the pressure and the star player, which happens in many teams. There is still room for midfielders who play more centrally and further back, who protect the defence and initiate offensive plays with excellent passes.",
      "\"They are the links between defence and attack. Great teams have this type of player. Casemiro, who has always stood out from midfield back, has evolved and is now a great playmaker.\"",
      "Casemiro, 33, has demonstrated exactly that recently, bagging three goals and one assist across his last four appearances for club and country. Having earned a Brazil recall under Ancelotti following a two-year absence from the Brazil squad, he has offered greater versatility for United compared to his Real Madrid days, transforming his significance at both domestic and international level.",
      "Having established himself as a deep-lying playmaker in Ancelotti's setup, the midfielder looks set to secure a starting berth for the World Cup after his latest outstanding display. This received more plaudits from Globo: \"But it was the creative and attacking players of the Brazilian national team who were the protagonists of last night.",
      "\"Increasingly in sync, Casemiro and Bruno Guimaraes are consolidating themselves as the starting midfield duo for the World Cup. Since Ancelotti's arrival, both have demonstrated a good ability to alternate in chasing down opposing midfielders and participating in the build-up to attacking plays.\"",
      "Correio Braziliense heaped further acclaim by suggesting Ancelotti has discovered his favoured blueprint: \"Casemiro, one of the few remaining players from the last World Cup and the team's main leader alongside Marquinhos, sealed the result. Both goals were scored in the first half, a period in which the Brazilian team was flawless.",
      "\"The presentation suggests that Ancelotti has found a starting line-up. Or at least he's close to it. It's quite likely that the 11 who started the match in the English capital will be at the World Cup. And that some of them will be starters at the World Cup hosted in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has hailed Senne Lammens' performances as \"outstanding\" and has talked up his future having established himself as the new Manchester United No 1.",
      "The Belgian has recently come into the fold having been signed in the summer as an unknown quantity. The goalkeeper has been a problem position for United across several seasons with Andre Onana struggling to convince during his two-year stint.",
      "He was, somewhat surprisingly, allowed to leave on loan and headed to Turkey in the summer. Altay Bayindir had been deputising but he failed to produce and, on deadline day, the club opted to bring in Lammens in an £18million deal from Royal Antwerp.",
      "The Belgian made his debut against Sunderland, keeping a clean sheet, and also helped secure a memorable win over Liverpool with United in the midst of a five-game unbeaten run which has seen them climb the table.",
      "Ferguson told Raceday RTV: \"Well, they are, the signs… the manager has had some good signs. Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they’ve added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success. The signs are getting better. I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they are enjoying it now.\"",
      "Lammens had made just 52 appearances in the Belgian Pro League before his move to the Premier League, but Amorim has shown huge faith in the 23-year-old who has looked an assured presence at the back.",
      "Ferguson himself could rely on two stellar goalkeepers during his trophy-laden stint. Peter Schmeichel proved to be an inspired signing when he arrived on English shores and Edwin van der Sar was the cornerstone of his success in the later years.",
      "It was the Scot who signed David de Gea shortly before his retirement in 2013. The Spaniard was the team's No 1 for more than a decade, winning a record four Player of the Year awards, but he was allowed to leave in 2023 when his contract came to an end with Onana bought in as his replacement.",

The Munich-born ace's future remains clouded in doubt with reports from Germany indicating that Ruben Amorim could be poised to pounce for the emerging talent.",
      "The 23-year-old, who has previously been linked with Liverpool, ranks among Europe's most exciting prospects and has already collected 11 caps for Germany on the international stage, so it comes as little shock that United are keen on securing his signature. His displays this campaign, though, have been rather disappointing.",
      "Adeyemi has managed to avoid finding the net or providing an assist since late September and has suffered a very public row with boss Niko Kovac.",
      "Should United manage to land Adeyemi, he would bring considerable attacking threat to their forward line, which already features the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The rapid winger has been timed covering 30 metres in a blistering 3.6 seconds, outpacing even Usain Bolt's 3.78 record and establishing him amongst the swiftest players in world football.",
      "He is the official fourth-fastest player in Bundesliga history, clocking 22.77mph in a win over Freiburg in the 2022/2023 season, with the pace earning him a goal in the process. The fastest-ever is Jean-Mattéo Bahoya, who came in at a stunning 23.09mph last season, eclipsing Sirlord Conteh's record which was set in the very same campaign.",
      "\"I think I can play in almost any position in the offensive line,\" he said. \"But right now I am thinking as a winger.\"",
      "Adeyemi then disclosed where he excels most during match situations, adding: \"I think to get on the nerves of the defenders all the time with one-against-one or runs behind the defenders. Being there where the defender cannot see me. Getting assists, getting goals. This, I think, is my game.\"",
      "On his electric pace, he added in the interview that he doesn't think any footballer could get close to him on the field when it comes to raw gas. He also denied a suggestion he could take part in the 2024 Olympic Games.",
      "His dispute with manager Kovac originated from an incident late last month, when Adeyemi hurled a water bottle in the direction of the dugout following his substitution.",
      "Kovac subsequently criticised Adeyemi's behaviour publicly, describing it as \"unnecessary\". During Dortmund's 1-1 draw with Hamburg last weekend, Kovac seemed frustrated with Adeyemi's performance and withdrew him after 66 minutes.",
      "Reports from Bild suggest talks regarding the winger's future have already commenced. With two years remaining on his existing deal, his representatives are allegedly seeking a lengthy contract extension alongside a £70million buyout clause.",
      "Adeyemi's ascent through football's ranks has been extraordinary to witness, with his progression spanning numerous years despite his tender age. In 2019, he claimed Germany's Fritz-Walter Medal as the nation's most promising under-17 talent.",
      "During that period at Red Bull Salzburg, he contributed one goal and four assists across just 12 appearances, helping secure the coveted honour.",
      "Adeyemi subsequently netted nine times whilst providing 12 assists the following campaign, before registering an impressive 23 goals and nine assists in the season after that. He then secured his switch to Dortmund for the 2022/2023 season and received his maiden international call-up.",
      "The Bundesliga have drawn parallels between him and Liverpool icon Mohamed Salah.",
      "\"Both goalscoring left-footers who make magic happen from out wide, there are plenty of similarities,\" reads the Bundesliga's comparison.",
      "\"Both are anti-Lionel Messis when it comes to their dribbling style, using high centre of gravity to trick defenders at speed. If they're not successful with a piece of skill, they tend to win a free kick in a dangerous area. Adeyemi prefers to start off the left to Salah's right, but there are signs that when it comes to entering the opponent's box, BVB's frontman could get even better.\"",

      "The Frenchman initially criticised Ratcliffe after legendary ex-United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was stripped of his ambassadorial role at the club in October 2024. Earlier this year, Cantona lambasted the club's owner for stripping United's soul and even dismissed plans for a £2billion 'New Trafford', which Ratcliffe hopes to replace their current M16 home with.",

      "However, Ratcliffe may need to rethink his favourite player following more harsh words from the 59-year-old. During a tour for his one-man show, Cantona seized the chance to criticise the hierarchy once again - referencing failed attempts to collaborate with Ratcliffe and his team.",

      "\"But he didn't seem interested. I did what I had to do, so I don't feel guilty anymore. I tried my best.\" Cantona, the Manchester United legend, also criticised the club's owners for abandoning Sir Alex Ferguson's attacking style of football.",
      "He said: \"Sir Alex Ferguson created a style of beautiful attacking football, which the new owners should have used. Instead, they destroyed it.\"",
      "Recently, Cantona's name has been linked with potential investment from the Middle East. Speculation was rife during the October international break when Saudi official Turki Al-Sheikh announced that an investor was on the verge of securing a deal for United.",
      "However, Al-Sheikh later clarified that he was not the potential investor, with talkSPORT suggesting that the likely investors are based in the UAE.",
      "The report also suggested that some United legends had been approached about participating in any potential bid.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs, via United Stand, revealed that Cantona had been in direct discussions about possibly taking on an ambassadorial role to support a prospective consortium's bid for United.",
      "It was also reported that other former players had been contacted, but not with the intention of investing.",

      "Chelsea icon Pat Nevin believes Conor Gallagher would be an ideal acquisition for Manchester United, with the Red Devils having previously been linked to the England international. United are understood to view Gallagher as an alternative option, whilst Brighton's Carlos Baleba remains their primary midfield target.",
      "However, the Seagulls have reportedly slapped a mammoth £100million valuation on the 21-year-old, which could prove a major stumbling block. Ruben Amorim's squad could make substantial savings by pursuing the ex-Chelsea star instead. Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo recently suggested that Atletico Madrid would entertain bids around the £52m mark.",
      "Former Scotland winger Nevin reckons Gallagher wouldn't merely strengthen Amorim's options, but would also provide crucial support for United captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Speaking to CasinoHawks, he said: \"I think Conor Gallagher would be great at Man Utd, in my opinion. Gallagher can play a number of positions. Remember Gallagher can play in a 3-4-2-1 formation. It wouldn't be the best as one of the wing-backs, but as one of the two in the central four.",
      "\"So you're talking about the two central midfielders or one of the two ahead as well. If you put him in one of the two more holding positions with his energy, his battling, it kind of frees Bruno Fernandes a wee bit to go a bit further forward, because he's been having to come back a few games, hasn't he? Playing in a more defensive place.",
      "\"The energy levels that Connor's got would be perfect which again makes you ask why they sold Scott McTominay.",
      "\"But the other thing about Connor, if you actually have to play him one further forward, there are very few in the game that are better in a high-pressing game.",
      "\"There are very few in football that can do better than him. He's brilliantly suited to the English game.",
      "\"If Manchester United have had a problem for quite some time, one of the biggest problems they've had is energy in midfield. With the best will in the world, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen were lovely players, fantastic world-class players, but they didn't have legs by the end.",
      "\"Certainly Casemiro still hasn't got the legs to do that three games a week. That's clear, that's obvious. So you need somebody in there who's got that. I would be looking at those central positions, to be honest.\"",
      "Gallagher came through Chelsea's academy after joining at six years old and worked his way into the senior squad. He gained experience during four loan spells at Charlton Athletic, Swansea City, West Brom and Crystal Palace before becoming a regular in the Blues' Premier League side.",
      "The England international switched to Atletico Madrid following Enzo Maresca's decision that he wouldn't feature as a consistent starter. However, following his debut campaign in Spain, Gallagher may now be heading back to the Premier League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Fresh developments have surfaced regarding Joshua Zirkzee's prospects at Manchester United as talk intensifies with the January transfer window looming. United brought Zirkzee over from Bologna during the summer of 2024 in a transaction valued at €42.5million (£37.5m).",
      "The Netherlands international arrived at Old Trafford following his acquisition by previous boss Erik ten Hag, though Zirkzee has struggled to secure regular minutes since Ruben Amorim took charge 12 months ago.",
      "Zirkzee has featured in merely five matches for United this season, with four coming in the Premier League, and remains without a goal in the current campaign.",
      "Consequently, persistent rumours have emerged connecting Zirkzee with a potential departure from United when the January market opens.",
      "Nevertheless, The Sun has suggested this scenario is unlikely as Zirkzee appears destined to stay put at Old Trafford. Reports indicate the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of departing United in the New Year.",
      "The publication suggests that the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which is anticipated to result in Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo being unavailable for multiple weeks, is shaping United's January planning.",
      "Zirkzee has reportedly been informed that a January transfer is off the table, with the striker expected to see more action on the pitch in December and January.",
      "Rumours have been swirling for a while now that Zirkzee was eyeing a January exit from United in pursuit of more consistent first-team football, but if recent reports are to be believed, this may not be feasible.",
      "In total, Zirkzee has scored just seven goals for United across his 54 appearances for the club since the start of last season.",
      "United will return to Premier League action after the November international break with a clash against Everton on the Monday after the rest of the league fixtures.",
      "It remains to be seen if Amorim will decide to give Zirkzee any minutes when the top flight resumes this month, with summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo, as well as Amad, often getting the majority of the minutes in the forward line.",

      "With only Erling Haaland and Igor Thiago managing more goals than Semenyo this term, speculation has mounted over his future on the south coast. A host of top-flight giants are believed to be monitoring his situation, with Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool all reportedly interested in snapping up his signature.",
      "This has led supporters nationwide to wonder whether Semenyo will still be plying his trade at Bournemouth come the 2026/27 season.",
      "When pressed by Jamie Redknapp about his future recently, the Ghana international responded: \"I don't think about it too much. I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens. When they [his former team-mates] all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club.",
      "\"But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year. How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well.",
      "\"I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment.\"",
      "Following his impressive tally of 13 goals in all competitions last campaign, Semenyo became the subject of transfer speculation linking him with a blockbuster switch to Manchester United during the summer window. Yet no agreement materialised, with the Red Devils instead securing the signature of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "At the same time, Tottenham - who had also been reportedly tracking Semenyo - moved to acquire Mohammed Kudus from West Ham in a £55million deal.",
      "Despite missing out on Semenyo, United splashed the cash at Old Trafford over the summer, as Ruben Amorim welcomed arrivals including Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens along with Mbeumo.",
      "The investment from the hierarchy appears to be bearing fruit.",

      "Premier League big-hitters Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal could have a battle on their hands in the summer. The trio are all monitoring Nathaniel Brown, it has been claimed, with a tug-of-war potentially on the horizon.",
      "Brown, 22, has established himself on the left of Eintracht Frankfurt's defence and received international recognition as a result. The youngster was part of the Germany Under-21 side which lost to England in the Euros final over the summer and earned his first senior cap against Luxembourg in October.",
      "According to Bild (via Sport Witness), Frankfurt are confident of making a significant profit on a player who cost them less than £3million when he signed from Nurnberg in 2024. A sum of €63.5m (more than £55m) has been floated, with Frankfurt's Markus Krosche arguing the left-back is worth a similar amount to what Chelsea paid for Spain defender Marc Cucurella.",
      "“Yes! Because he has three exceptional abilities that you can’t learn. He’s smart and tactically astute, has fantastic technique, and is very fast. And all of that is necessary to have a great career ahead of him,\" Krosche is quoted as saying while discussing Brown and fellow youngster Can Uzun.",
      "“Now is the wrong time to think about who might leave us and when,\" he added. \"They’re both young and should stay with us a while longer. Can has developed tremendously compared to last year. It’s a shame he’s injured now.",
      "“And Nene (Brown) is simply exceptional. He’s made outstanding progress, especially when it comes to defending at a high level. Just look at how he plays against top opponents in the Champions League.”",
      "Frankfurt have brought in good money for some of their star players in recent seasons. Omar Marmoush fetched £59m when he left for Manchester City in January, while the summer sale of Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool could net them up to £79m including add-ons.",
      "Other big-money recent sales include a pair of sales to Paris Saint-Germain, with Willian Pacho and Randal Kolo Muani fetching more than £120m between them. After their latest summer rebuild, Dino Toppmoller's side currently sit seventh in the Bundesliga, while they have four points from four Champions League games despite suffering a heavy home defeat against Liverpool with Ekitike on target.",
      "Jonathan Burkardt is the latest addition to thrive at Deutsche Bank Park. The German international striker, signed for roughly £18.5m from Mainz over the summer, has nine goals in 15 appearances in all competitions this term. It could be Brown, however, who becomes the latest to fetch a significant fee. The defender, who can also fill in on the left of midfield, is under contract until 2030 and Frankfurt will be under no pressure to sell on the cheap.",

      "“First of all, I think there’s a lot of talk about one club or another,” he said. “If you ask me, it would be a dream to play for one of these clubs, whether it’s Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.",

      "“My focus is on Crystal Palace. We’ll see when the winter transfer window gets closer.”",

      "“He’s a player with extraordinary qualities. He can play anywhere on the pitch, he’s special. He can play as a midfielder, or as a defender,\" said Carlo Ancelotti of Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "Camavinga is supremely talented and he was on Manchester United's radar before he signed for Real Madrid, so perhaps United should reignite their interest at the end of the season.",
      "You were probably tempted to close the article after reading that sentence. \"Why would a Madrid player join United?\" you likely thought. It may seem unlikely, but stranger things have happened in football.",
      "Camavinga has slotted back into Madrid's team after recovering from an ankle injury, starting three games, but he was back on the bench for the 4-0 victory against Valencia at the Bernabeu.",
      "A move for Camavinga would be ambitious. It's not rocket science to work out that he is at the best club to lift major honours, although Madrid may consider parting ways with Camavinga if the money is right. Every player has a price in football. Nobody is outright not for sale.",
      "United were interested in signing Carlos Baleba from Brighton in the summer transfer window. Brighton value Baleba in excess of £100million and that valuation won't change much by next summer.",
      "Yes, a move for Camavinga seems unlikely, but it would make sense to make an offer to Madrid before potentially spending a similar fee on Baleba, who is not on the same level.",
      "If United are prepared to commit a package worth around £80m to £90m for a midfield signing, they should test Madrid's resolve for a dream target before turning to someone like Baleba.",
      "What have United got to lose? You miss all the shots you don't take. United were first interested in Camavinga in 2021 when he was at Rennes and had entered the final year of his contract.",
      "The argument to at least consider sending an enquiry about Camavinga is essentially based on Baleba not being worth the fee Brighton valued him at. The 21-year-old failed in his audition at Old Trafford last month and he hasn't looked like a £50m player, never mind a £100m player.",
      "Baleba was substituted at half-time against Everton in August, and he didn't look like the midfielder who caught United's attention last season when he came off the bench against Bournemouth in September.",
      "Speaking after Bournemouth, Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler admitted he was struggling. \"I think it’s normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s not easy for this player to handle it. Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",
      "\"But he’s a young player and I think that’s something we have to accept, that young players don’t always have the face we want to see. It’s our responsibility to help them in the right moments.\"",
      "When asked specifically if the interest from United had affected the midfielder, the Brighton boss added: \"I think everyone gets affected, especially when you are that young and you hear these kinds of things, no matter if they are wrong or right. But it’s just noise we don’t need.\"",
      "Baleba must improve and put an underwhelming start to the campaign behind him if he wants to earn a move to Old Trafford. United must consider other options in the meantime, including ambitious targets.",

      "He's long been touted as a star of the future and at times this season has looked like he is making good on that potential.",
      "Dortmund Sporting Director Sebastian Kehl, speaking after Adeyemi starred in a win over Wolfsburg earlier this term, said: \"(Karim) exudes a certain kind of relaxed attitude, professionalism, but also a winning mentality. At the moment, he's probably the best Karim Adeyemi we've seen here at Borussia Dortmund.\"",
      "The Germany international has only managed three goals this season and is under contract at Dortmund until 2027, with reports suggesting he wants a release clause included in any new deal.",
      "Adeyemi is a player who thrives when running at defenders and has a thirst to improve his numbers, with goals and assists key to the way he plays. He's grown in stature at Dortmund since arriving in 2022 from RB Salzburg, following a path trodden by Erling Haaland.",
      "Having been at Bayern Munich as a young player, he was plucked from the second tier of German Under-19 football to join Salzburg. And the man recognised as spotting the untapped talent? Christopher Vivell - now head of recruitment at Old Trafford but then a scout within the Red Bull system.",
      "The established connection between the pair would likely be a lure for Adeyemi if the reported interest from United were to be firmed up. Adeyemi was overlooked for the most recent Germany squad but did feature in October and has one goal from 11 caps for his country.",
      "He first made his debut four years ago, while still at Salzburg, with his decision to move to Austria vindicated by regular football at a young age and European experience.",
      "\"The most important thing for a young guy is to play,\" he said, speaking in 2023 of his decision to join RB Salzburg. \"They have a second team who play against adults. I played in the second league as a 16-year-old, a lot of games. I adapted to men's football and this is what is important for a young player.",
      "\"If you develop you can play in the first team of Salzburg and they play Champions League or Europa League. That is a great thing for a young player and you learn a lot. There are really good players in Salzburg and, for me, it was the best move that I could do.\"",
      "That move came about in part because of Vivell. Maybe the United chief will have a say in his next transfer as well.",

      "Just 44 goals. That is the measly sum Manchester United managed to conjure up last season in the Premier League.",
      "To put that into perspective, only the bottom three and Everton scored fewer goals in the top flight. No wonder United were left hovering above the relegation zone.",
      "It was United's major failing and while the argument can be made that the league was sacrificed towards the end of the campaign for the Europa League, goals were an issue when the Reds were taking it seriously. On just 12 occasions out of 38 Premier League matches last season did United score twice or more in a single game.",
      "This includes the times when even that was not enough to secure the three points - like against Brentford and Everton away where the Reds. Compare that to this season, and already the figures are looking brighter.",
      "Only 11 Premier League matches in and United have scored two or more goals in seven games and they have not yet lost after scoring on multiple occasions in a single match. So what could be behind this up turn in form?",
      "Well, the inclusion of Bryan Mbeumo into the starting XI has helped but there is also a secret weapon starting to take pressure off the forward line. His name is Casemiro.",
      "The Brazilian is not known for his goalscoring pedigree. As a defensive midfielder, he hasn't been expected to chip in with goals and his best goalscoring seasons were when he bagged seven in 2020/21 for Real Madrid and matched that tally in his debut campaign with United.",
      "Yet this campaign has seen him score three goals already, easily swamping his record in the 2024/25 Premier League. He scored five in the entirety of last season which included a brace against a hapless Leicester City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Casemiro currently finds himself as United's second top scorer at the club and this could be because of a change in style that we are seeing Ruben Amorim and the rest of the Premier League employ. MEN Sport have spoken previously about the danger the midfielder poses from set pieces.",
      "Apart from his goal against Brighton, which even he will admit was fortuitous, Casemiro has scored either directly or indirectly from a set piece. Against Chelsea, the goal came as the away side failed to deal with a short corner routine which the Brazilian eventually nodded in.",
      "At Nottingham Forest, he headed home from a corner and during this weekend's international friendly against Senegal at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, he showed great composure from a Rodrygo free kick to add another goal. Casemiro is quickly becoming a danger man from dead ball scenarios for both club and country and that can only be a good thing for United.",
      "Lots could be made of Rasmus Hojlund's lack of goals last season, but it should not be solely down to the centre-forward to be scoring. Goals need to be coming from all over the park and that is what Casemiro is starting to do.",
      "United are no longer so one-dimensional in their attack. Just ten different players scored in the Premier League for the Reds last season, now there is already nine different goalscorers.",
      "Casemiro is the secret weapon though, leading the way for others to chip in with goals in the Premier League this season.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United's struggle for goals last season saw them turn to the perilous field of the January transfer market.",
      "Their two senior striker options, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, had mustered just five league goals between them as the final knockings of the mid-season window approached. Mathys Tel and Christopher Nkunku were considered as emergency options to sharpen one of the league's bluntest attacks, but ultimately United stuck with the misfiring Hojlund and Zirkzee.",
      "Two league goals for Hojlund in the second half of the campaign and none for Zirkzee, alongside an abysmal 15th-placed finish and no silverware added to the cabinet, would suggest United were wrong not to sign a striker in January. But the truth is neither Tel nor Nkunku were the answer.",
      "Tel bagged a January loan move to Spurs and notched just two league goals. He would go on to secure a permanent £30million move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and his haul of four league goals for the club in nearly a year is hardly eye-watering stuff - albeit one of those strikes did deny United a win at Spurs earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, Nkunku scored just one Premier League goal in the second half of the 2024/25 season before swapping Chelsea for AC Milan in a £36m deal in the summer. His Serie A tally for the Italian giants currently stands at zero.",
      "Neither striker would have helped United salvage something from a disastrous campaign, and neither would have been able to provide the focal point Ruben Amorim's system requires. Say what you like about Benjamin Sesko, he is a physical presence and in time could become the foil Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha need to go up yet another gear at Old Trafford.",
      "United were right to avoid the £66m pair last January, and they may need to hold their nerve yet again in a few months' time.",
      "Sesko has shown signs of promise but is still adapting to life in England, while Zirkzee is understood to want out of Old Trafford in a bid to reignite his World Cup dream.",
      "United are said to have no interest in allowing Zirkzee to move on in January, and it's a stance they must stick by. For all his flaws, Zirkzee has shown himself to be a useful squad player at times. He is not good enough to challenge for a place in the first team and should be moved on next summer, but midway through a season isn't the time to go cutting ties with one of your two senior striker options before desperately searching for a player who will need time to settle in and could cost a small fortune.",
      "With the likes of Mbeumo and Cunha adding to United's attacking threat, Amorim has goals all over the pitch and doesn't need his strikers to be hitting 25 goals a season, although if United are to challenge for titles of course Sesko will eventually need to reach that point.",
      "Nineteen goals in 11 league games is no bad record. There is no need for unnecessary upheaval in the January transfer window.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "Manchester United let down their fanbase last season with poor performances across all competitions.",
      "The Europa League was nearly the saving grace but when push came to shove, the Reds were not the team they needed to be. United were so far away from the levels expected of them that it was hard to see a quick recovery.",
      "And yet here we are in mid-November with United a point off the top-four and five games unbeaten. They are not the finished article but there are clear signs that United are becoming a team who can challenge at the right end of the Premier League.",
      "Speaking to MEN Sport, psychology expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, Dr Martin Turner, believes the turnaround could lie in the mentality of the squad this season.",
      "Dr Turner, who has worked alongside The FA and Scarlets Rugby, said: \"It is so important when we talk about experienced players, it is not just because they have kicked a ball more times than the player next to them, but they have gone through the peaks and troughs of football. They have been under pressure, they have succeeded, they have failed, and they have become psychologically robust to the different ups and downs of the sport.",
      "\"That is part of the reason why experience really counts because through facing difficulty you grow and develop and learn to be a bit more robust. So it is partly about time, particularly with Manchester United and the amount of change that has taken place over a short period of time, which we know can be stressful and taxing, [but] over time those players will start to acclimatise to that and become more robust.\"",
      "When asked if the recruitment of players like Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who have proven Premier League quality, while keeping players who experienced the lows of last season and overcome them, is leading to improved performances this season, Dr Turner replied: \"Yes, exactly they are just able to weather those storms a little better.",
      "\"They have less psychological peaks and troughs. After a good game, they will feel pretty good but they won’t get carried away with it and after a bad game, they would feel pretty bad but it wouldn’t be the end of the world for them. They learn to take success and failure in their stride because they have succeeded and failed so often.",
      "\"When you look at the world’s best performers, it is not just that they succeed all the time, they are able to recognise that when they do fail, it is a temporary thing and they know that they will come back and bounce back. That is hard for a less experienced player to realise because they haven’t had the psychological experience of those successes and failures. Sometimes it takes failure at the biggest stage to do some of that too.\"",
      "Next Monday, United return to the Premier League when they host Everton at Old Trafford. Should they avoid defeat, they will be six games unbeaten. However, the lingering worry for United is that tiredness could start to creep in despite playing fewer matches this season.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt spoke after the Tottenham game about the team feeling tired in the second half of matches and Dr Turner believes that the mental challenges of competing in the Premier League are contributing to that.",
      "\"The brain is using largely the same energy system as the body, people forget that the brain is in the body,\" he said.",
      "\"It feels like it is this separate thing because we talk about mind and body but they are obviously part of the same body so they are using the same energy. We know that it is actually quite difficult for people in high pressured situations, tough jobs, like being an athlete, and that can be exhausting.",
      "\"Not just the physical stuff but dealing with the emotions every day, dealing with expectation, dealing with the social aspect of being involved in sport at a high level, it can actually make you mentally exhausted and it can have an impact on your physical exhaustion because the energy is coming from the same space. So it is about developing this resistance and robustness over time to these kinds of things which is where experienced players come in.\"",

      "Mainoo was something of a breakout star for England in their run to the final of Euro 2024 and seemed to have a central midfield position under lock and key for years to come for club and country. Under two years later and the 20-year-old has fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim and will need a January move and a stunning run of form to offer any hope of a late run into Thomas Tuchel’s England thinking.",
      "Mainoo’s stuttering career is puzzling to plenty and while Amorim has offered words of encouragement, they haven’t translated into meaningful minutes.",
      "And even though he is on the fringes of things at Old Trafford, United are unlikely to sanction a temporary move away for the youngster given he is a regular in matchday squads.",
      "It’s a similar story for Zirkzee, who came off the bench for the Netherlands against England in that semi-final but can’t get off it for United this season.",
      "He’s been used sparingly by Amorim and even the injury to sole centre forward Benjamin Sesko doesn’t look like yielding many minutes for the Dutchman.",
      "He has been left out of the recent international squads and with Ronald Koeman’s side all but assured a place in the World Cup, Zirkzee must surely move if he is to join his countrymen in North America.",

      "Manchester United may be closing in on a solution to a long-standing squad issue, with one player calling a move to Old Trafford a \"dream come true.\" Ruben Amorim's recent transfer activity has had a positive impact at United, so much so that Sir Alex Ferguson has publicly praised one particular signing.",
      "While United's fall from grace in recent years has seen the club struggle to attract certain elite stars, the well is evidently not dry. And there are even those willing to publicly campaign for their transfers, suggesting a move could happen as soon as January.",
      "It remains unclear how active United will be in the upcoming January transfer window. However, recent developments suggest a promising outlook as we delve deeper into winter, and MEN Sport breaks down all the latest happenings around the club.",
      "Crystal Palace full-back Daniel Munoz has expressed his desire to potentially sign for Amorim, saying it would be a \"dream come true\" to play for United. The Colombian is having an excellent second season at Selhurst Park and recently included United in his list of preferred transfer destinations.",
      "\"First of all, I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another,\" he told AS. \"If you ask me, it would be a dream come true to play for one of these clubs, whether it's Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.\"",
      "This statement leaves no doubt the player would be open to a transfer enquiry. And given United's struggle to fill the right wing-back position as required by Amorim's system, Munoz could be the perfect addition.",
      "Amad is presently occupying the role, whilst Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot have provided cover in that area when available. Even before Amorim's appointment, questions were being raised about whether the right flank of the defence possessed the necessary quality.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that [a big transfer],\" added Munoz before suggesting he would be receptive to a January move. \"I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because it's a dream of mine to get there.",
      "\"Right now I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. If you ask me, I don't have any concrete information that any of these clubs are interested in me. My focus is on Crystal Palace; we'll see when the winter transfer window gets closer. Right now, I'm fully focused on these two matches with the national team.\"",
      "Among the wave of new arrivals who joined Old Trafford during the summer window, players such as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha emerge as particularly noteworthy additions. The duo were part of a £200million offensive overhaul that also included Benjamin Sesko, with supporters expressing considerable satisfaction with their contributions thus far.",
      "Nevertheless, Ferguson's focus was drawn to the other end of the pitch when discussing the new arrival who has made the most significant impact. And the United legend has been delighted by the transformative influence Senne Lammens has brought after United signed him from Royal Antwerp in an £18.2m deal.",
      "\"There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,\" he told Raceday RTV. \"Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he's only played three or four games and he's looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they've added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - the signs are getting better.",
      "\"I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they'll enjoy it now.\"",
      "Andre Onana failed to inspire between the posts before he was sent out on loan to Trabzonspor this season. And the last-minute deal to add Lammens to their ranks looks like a gamble that's paying off thus far.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "\"I know people talk about this but Ronaldo scored lots of goals for us in this qualifying campaign,\" Fernandes said.",

      "The Premier League is reportedly facing the threat of legal action over a controversial new financial rule set to be voted on this Friday.",
      "The proposed 'anchoring' rule, seen by many as a form of salary cap, would limit clubs' spending to five times the amount paid to the team finishing bottom of the league.",
      "This contentious rule has already drawn threats of legal action from the Professional Footballer's Association (PFA). Now, it appears that three of the biggest football agencies - CAA Stellar, CAA Base and Wasserman - are ready to join the fray should the rule be approved, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "These agencies represent several high-profile players who currently play or have played in the Premier League. Their rosters include Man City's John Stones, Everton's Jack Grealish, Chelsea's Cole Palmer, Arsenal's Eberechi Eze, Liverpool's Curtis Jones, as well as Ivan Toney, who has been linked with a return to the league in January.",
      "Through a leading law firm, these agencies have reportedly communicated their stance to Premier League executives. They argue that the introduction of the 'anchoring' rule would violate competition law and have indicated they will take legal action if the rule is passed.",
      "The position mirrors that of both the PFA and the two Manchester clubs. Both Manchester United and City are understood to feel such a move could prove detrimental to the Premier League and make it easier for talent to relocate abroad.",
      "A ballot on whether to examine the new regulation was conducted last year, with 16 clubs backing the proposal. For the change to be implemented, 14 clubs must vote in favour.",
      "The suggested new regulations are believed to align the league more closely with UEFA's SCR (Squad Cost Ratio) framework, which permits teams to allocate up to 70 per cent of their income on their squads. Those regulations have been operational for several seasons across Europe and already apply to clubs competing in European tournaments.",
      "Opposing the potential new regulation last week, PFA chief executive Maheta Molango said: \"We have a tendency in football to think that we are above the law. The reality is that you cannot artificially cap someone's ability to make a living as this would just not withstand any legal challenge.",
      "\"We've been clear with the Premier League that it is something we will oppose but the Premier League themselves know that, even before the PFA does this, there will be clubs within their own room who will legally challenge the measure.",
      "\"The only ones who end up winning are the lawyers. We want to talk about football, we don't want to talk about legal bills.\"",
      "The Premier League have been approached by the MEN for comment. In response to the PFA's opposition, a spokesperson previously stated: \"We disagree with the PFA's views regarding the proposed financial rules and the extensive consultation process we have been conducting with our clubs and other stakeholders.",
      "\"The PFA has had numerous opportunities since March 2024 to provide feedback on, and shape, the proposals and the principles that underpin them. Where the League has received feedback on the New Financial System from stakeholders, including the PFA, we have considered it carefully and, where appropriate, incorporated it into formulating the draft rules.",
      "\"It is the League's objective to maintain the Premier League's value, competitive balance and ensure clubs operate in a financially sustainable way.",
      "\"We are engaging with our clubs, and they will continue to evaluate the proposals. They will have the opportunity to vote on them later this month.\"",

      "Before a ball was kicked, the narrative for Manchester United's clash with PSG had already been written.",
      "Mary Earps, rightly or wrongly, has dominated the headlines, and everyone was waiting to see how the night unfurled. When she emerged from the tunnel at Old Trafford, she received a rapturous reception from the early birds in the stadium.",
      "It was not a given, but was perhaps to be expected. What was not in the script was the boos that rung out every time she touched the ball in the game.",
      "To their credit, the United fans aimed to drown out the boos with cheers and, by the end, Earps had won them round. But thanks to their performance on the pitch, the Reds changed the narrative.",
      "Instead of talking about Earps, the main takeaway from last night's game was the performances of the players in red. Safia Middleton-Patel who managed to overcome the nerves of replacing Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who suffered a facial injury against Aston Villa, produced a decent display to help win the game.",
      "Her save at the start of the second half was top draw and one which United keepers of all codes would have been proud of. Melvine Malard, before being forced off with cramp, was superb leading the line and left Earps with no chance as she curled the ball beyond the former England No.1.",
      "Jayde Riviere was dynamic at right-back and her last-ditch tackles helped keep PSG at bay as they pushed for an equaliser. Jess Park did superbly well for the winner, linking up play with neat one-twos before Anna Sandberg crossed for Fridolina Rolfo to win the match.",
      "Earps may have dominated the build-up to this fixture, but it will be the United players who will be remembered when we look back at this game at the end of the season. United now sit third in the Champions League table, with women's powerhouses Barcelona and Lyon the only other teams to have 100% starts to the competition.",
      "Marc Skinner was beaming in his post-match press conference and he had every right to be. This United team has really gelled and you now have to wonder just how far they can go in both the Women's Super League and the Champions League.",
      "On the state of that performance, they have every right to think they can go deep into all of the competitions ahead of them.",

      "While she was cheered by fans before and after the match, she was subject to a smattering of boos during the early stages of the game.",

      "While there were some boos for Earps during the game, she received a positive response following the full-time whistle. Goals from Melvine Mallard and Fridolina Rolfo gave United a 2-1 win.",
      "Following the game, Cesar gave his instant reaction to the reception and Earps' performance. \"A lot of the public has great interest in seeing Mary play. I'm very happy to have a player like her in our team,\" he said.",
      "\"The fans here were clearly behind her. At the beginning, perhaps not, but by the end of the game her quality shone through.",

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt believes a combination of changing his mindset and staying injury-free is the reason for his excellent performances this season.",
      "Last weekend, De Ligt rescued a point against Tottenham in the Premier League with a late goal. The Dutchman is the only United player to have played every league minute during the campaign, and has been recalled to the Netherlands squad for the November internationals.",
      "De Ligt previously explained how he is benefiting from having an uninterrupted pre-season in the summer, and he provided fresh insight into his consistent displays during an interview with NOS Sport.",
      "“I’m 26 now and, I think, I’m entering the best years of my career, both physically and mentally,\" he said. \"I’ve changed my mindset. Initially, I didn’t want to make mistakes, now I want to do as many good things as possible.”",
      "De Ligt was asked to explain his improvement and discussed the toll injuries had taken on his confidence.",
      "He said: “There are a few explanations for that. I’ve had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body. This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism [about his condition] anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "On his return to the Netherlands squad after being overlooked last month, the defender added: “If you’re not in the squad, it affects you. But the national coach decides. For me, it was important to stay true to myself and keep going. I think being selected again is a victory.\"",
      "Earlier in the week, Netherlands manager Koeman explained De Ligt's recall, saying: \"He didn't look confident in his play, and I told him so. He's calmer now, and I felt I should include him again.\"",
      "De Ligt was not included in the United leadership group that was introduced in the summer, but boss Ruben Amorim said the Dutchman leads by example when he spoke during his post-Spurs press conference.",
      "\"We choose. Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play, then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other. I think he is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well. I think he has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball.",
      "\"He is doing that really well because that is a smart thing for a player. But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",

      "Former Manchester United and England goalkeeper Mary Earps was cheered by fans as she made her way out on to the pitch for Paris Saint-Germain's warm-up, before the goalkeeper was subject to a smattering of boos during the early stages of the Champions League match.",
      "Earps returned to Old Trafford for the first time this evening after leaving the club for the Parisians - in June 2024. The 32-year-old has made headlines in the past few weeks following the release of her book; 'All In'.",
      "An excerpt from that book caused controversy as she discussed a conversation she had with England head coach Sarina Wiegman about Chelsea star Hannah Hampton. It was claimed in the book that the goalkeeper, who helped England win Euro 2025, was criticised by Earps prior to the tournament.",
      "Earps alleged that Hampton was 'disruptive and unreliable' during Euro 2022 and is believed to have told Wiegman that the Dutch head coach was 'rewarding bad behaviour' by calling up the 24-year-old thereafter. These allegations were met with backlash from England fans and Earps has since spoken out to defend her comments.",
      "In a statement on Instagram following backlash, Earps said: \"It is not easy to be as vulnerable and open as I have been in the book, and I also understand that my honesty and rawness will divide opinion. That's okay, everyone is entitled to feel what they feel and I respect that.\"",
      "Speaking prior to the match, the goalkeeper admitted she expected a frosty reception at Old Trafford. That's not what played out on the night, at least pre-match, but Earps was booed when she took her first touch of the ball, even if the majority of fans tried to drown that out with further cheers!",
      "\"I'm probably expecting a little booing,\" she said. \"I hope it's a little bit, but it might be a lot.",
      "\"A few of the fans have come out to support me at PSG, but United is their No.1 team. I understand that.\"",
      "When asked about the prospect of Earps being booed, United head coach Marc Skinner also moved to ward off potential ill-will towards his former player. \"Deep down I know Mary is a good person,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm sure part of bringing out a book is bringing out controversial stuff that will help sell the book. I know that she has to defend that publicly.",
      "\"Knowing the human she is, I'm sure she will be getting criticism that she won't like. It's part of the other side of releasing a book.",
      "\"But she's a great person, she doesn't need me to say that really.",
      "\"I hope people toe the line with criticism, but I'm sure Mary understands the situation she's put herself in.",
      "\"She's on a platform where people are interested in what she says, so that's a credit to her and to her hard work. The goalkeeper we had at the start, to the one that left, was not the same person. She transformed.\"",
      "Once the whistle goes this evening, Earps will be hoping her performance will not leave the home fans so happy. United headed into the match with two wins from two matches in the Champions League - while PSG had yet to pick up a point in the competition this season.",

      "The distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres to 7.9 metres, and the single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK with a capacity of 17,500 people.",
      "The steep South Stand is remarkable. It was designed with the hope that it would generate an intimidating atmosphere, but no such noise was produced during the game on Saturday.",
      "Like a lot of big clubs in the Premier League, Spurs have become a tourist attraction, which means there were hundreds of fans with tickets in that stand who did not contribute to the atmosphere.",
      "That is their prerogative and 'tourist fans' are still valued fans, but local Tottenham season ticket holders have argued their South Stand should be a designated area for supporters looking to create noise.",
      "The Stretford End is currently that stand within Old Trafford, and United should consider introducing a designated singing section to ensure an atmosphere can be created in the new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "I was fortunate enough to visit White Hart Lane before it was demolished. It was an ageing ground and Spurs were right to move on, but it could be intimidating for the opposition.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur stadium is not intimidating. It feels welcoming. United need to ensure they don't fall into the same trap.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "As the stagger unwinds across various continents’ World Cup qualifying competitions, we’re starting to get a clearer idea about which countries – and thus which star players – might somehow still be in danger of missing out on a tournament almost everyone (well, 48 countries) now qualifies for.",
      "Fair to say the peril for these guys still ranges from ‘mild’ to ‘extreme’ to ‘confirmed’ and there’s plenty still to keep an eye on across the remainder of the current international break and the final box-filling in March.",
      "You can check out how World Cup qualifying for the new expanded 48-team tournament works here, because in lots of places it’s now very different to how it was before.",
      "In particular, as you’ll see, there are some huge names from European countries particularly grateful for the whopping great safety net that’s in place for teams who won their most recent Nations League group – at whatever level.",
      "",
      "Let the always entertaining and in no way boring Liverpool-Arsenal arguments begin over who is better out of Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. And then row in, mischief blazing, and insist the answer is in fact Dejan Kulusevski, actually.",
      "But the main point here is that right now all of them are at serious risk of missing the World Cup, with Sweden already looking mighty relieved to have that Nations League-based safety net to get them into the play-offs because they sit forlornly right at the very bottom of their qualifying group, 12 whole points behind perennial qualifiers Switzerland and nine behind second-placed Kosovo.",
      "That wretched form means they can’t be given much hope of grabbing one of the four places 16 teams will fight for next March, despite the quality in their ranks.",
      "",
      "Having cited ‘mental tiredness’ as he made himself unavailable for June’s international break, Poland’s talisman was replaced as captain by coach Michal Probierz. Lewandowski’s response was to say that he would not play for Poland again until the coach was sacked.",
      "A damaging 2-1 defeat to Finland on the back of the Lewandowki spat meant that by the time the September internationals came along, Probierz was gone and Lewandowski was back for an impressive 1-1 draw in Holland secured by Matty Cash’s late equaliser.",
      "A 3-1 return win over Finland means fears of missing out altogether have now eased, but it’s going to be a journey down what is almost guaranteed to be a tricky play-off route in which 16 entrants of assorted quality are whittled down to four qualifiers.",
      "",
      "Getting battered by a ridiculously talented Norway side has cost manager Luciano Spalletti his job but it could also help cost Italy a place at the World Cup, and that includes the Manchester City goalkeeper.",

      "",
      "Having gone up another level following his move to PSG and swift treble glory inside six months, Kvaratskhelia is now well established among the very best players in the world.",
      "But he still faces an uphill struggle to qualify for a World Cup with Georgia, having to come through what is the toughest and most competitive qualification region and also the one to benefit the least from the expansion to 48 teams.",
      "Georgia are already out of contention this time, trailing way behind Spain and Turkey in their group.",
      "",
      "Interesting times for the centre-back, who has seen an awful lot of things change at Nottingham Forest over recent weeks and months while also watching Serbia make a mess of a World Cup group in which finishing well behind England was no disgrace but failing to muster much of a challenge to Albania for the runner-up spot – and with it a chance in the play-offs – definitely was.",
      "",
      "Even with Africa being one of the big winners from the World Cup’s expansion, a couple of traditional big names have got themselves in bother with Cameroon among the headline-making failures to qualify.",
      "Cameroon lost out to Cape Verde in what was one of the big stories from qualification anywhere, and then crashed out of the play-offs that could’ve kept them in contention until March.",
      "Plenty of familiar names in the Cameroon squad, but Manchester United’s big summer signing from Brentford would be the biggest.",

      "Another African country with plenty of World Cup pedigree who won’t be in North America next summer is Nigeria after losing on penalties to DR Congo in the play-off final for a place in next March’s last-chance inter-confederation play-offs.",
      "Galatasaray striker and Liverpool mini-crisis contributor Osimhen is perhaps the biggest global star from a squad that underperformed badly during qualification, but he is far from alone. Alex Iwobi, Wilfrid Ndidi, Ademola Lookman, Ola Aina and Kelechi Iheanacho have all been involved.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘torn over’ signing a new striker in January after Benjamin Sesko picked up an injury before the international break.",
      "In the summer, one of Man Utd‘s priorities was to sign a new striker, as Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee only scored seven Premier League goals last season.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with several potential targets, including Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap, before landing Sesko for around £74m.",
      "Sesko has three goal involvements in his eleven Premier League appearances for United as he’s certainly been the least impressive of the club’s four marquee summer signings.",
      "The Slovenia international has struggled for match fitness as he’s been eased in by Ruben Amorim, but Gary Neville and other pundits have prematurely criticised him.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Liverpool drop a full 15 places!",
      "Man Utd and Sesko were dealt a blow before the international break as the striker suffered a knee injury during his side’s draw against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "The severity of his injury is yet to be confirmed, but it has been reported that he could be unavailable for a few weeks.",
      "Therefore, it has been suggested that the Red Devils could enter the market for another new striker in January, but a report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claims they are ‘torn over’ signing a forward in the winter.",
      "This is because they do not ‘want to block Sesko’s pathway to becoming a top Premier League No.9’, though they would step up their efforts to sign a new striker if Zirkzee leaves.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The Red Devils may become open to the idea, but sources are giving indications that they want to avoid having direct competition for Sesko as it is likely to harm his progress and could dent his confidence.",
      "‘Man Utd remain totally committed to making sure his transfer becomes a success story.’",
      "Like Zirkzee, Casemiro could leave Man Utd in 2026 as he is in the final year of his contract.",
      "Man Utd have the option to extend his deal on the same terms until 2027 and he has been in great form, but they are unlikely to do this because he earns over £300,000 a week.",
      "So, a report from Caught Offside claims Casemiro’s ‘future depends on his wage demands’.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Internally, Amorim has reiterated that Casemiro is “crucial” to maintaining structure, especially in high-pressure matches where his tactical intelligence continues to shine.",
      "‘However, the final decision may be out of Amorim’s hands. Casemiro’s deal expires at the end of the season, and while United possess an option to extend it for a further year, the board is hesitant.’",
      "A Manchester United attacker has reportedly been told there is ‘no chance’ that he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with the club to ‘block requests’ in the winter.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing’ to offer Casemiro a new contract, but they want him to take a massive pay-cut.",
      "Real Madrid youngster Endrick has reportedly responded to shock interest from Man Utd after Benjamin Sesko suffered an injury.",
      "Unexpected standouts from Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs are among a Premier League sextet experiencing a shock resurgence this season…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have performed a ‘U-turn’ on Casemiro, while one exit could ‘open the door’ for a ‘gamble’ January transfer.",

      "There are still a few glaring holes in Man Utd’s squad, with it widely reported that their focus is on signing a new No.6 to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement.",

      "This is said to be due to Anderson being the more affordable and versatile option.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘United see Nottingham Forest’s England international Anderson as another target and his ability to play No6 and also as a marauding midfielder means they are ready to pull out all the stops to get him. He is attracting huge interest after his impressive performances for club and country and Forest know they are facing a battle to keep hold of him.",
      "‘However, he is likely to cost less than £100m-rated Baleba and that is why he is seen as a good piece of potential business. United veteran Casemiro’s contract is running down and would have to take a pay cut to stay.’",
      "Manchester United star Matheus Cunha answered with just three words when asked by an Arsenal fan if he was going to join the north London club.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly entered the race to sign Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson with the Gunners ‘not backing down’ over his price tag.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘prepared to pay’ a huge fee to fend off competition from rivals to sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest.",
      "Casemiro’s revival has got Manchester United out of their midfield hole. But Ruben Amorim cannot afford to gamble on the Brazilian carrying the Red Devils into Europe.",

      "Several factors are behind Man Utd’s improvement this season, including their positive summer recruitment.",

      "Now, Ferguson has reserved special praise for Lammens, but he thinks there are “good signs” for Man Utd due to these three players.",
      "“Well, they are, the signs… the manager has had some good signs,” Ferguson told RTV Raceday.",
      "“Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",

      "“But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they are enjoying it now.”",
      "Lammens was signed to replace Andre Onana at Man Utd and former Premier League goalkeeper Ben Foster recently commented on the difference between these two players.",
      "“I didn’t know what to expect at the beginning. It’s a massive step up and you need somebody with a bit of authority and a bit of an aura about them to step into that Manchester United team,” Foster said.",
      "“But he’s done it so far with absolute ease and he’s got this confidence about him. He’s coming out for balls into the box, where you’re normally talking about seriously seasoned Premier League goalies that do this kind of stuff and he’s doing it from the get-go.",

This is the David Watson of relative journeymanship, who ended up at Werder Bremen in 1979 after spells with Notts County, Rotherham, Sunderland and Manchester City. His red card and subsequent eight-week ban in his second Werder game – as well as an early return to England – meant he played more often for his country (four times) than his club (twice) while in Germany.",

      "Barcelona (4)",
      "Barcelona apparently wanted to send Rashford back to Manchester United within a month of borrowing him for a season but he remains in Spain for now as their first England representative since Gary Lineker. He even scored for his country for the first time in almost two years during his Catalan loan.",
      "",
      "Roma (5)",
      "In that eternal race to live off a cameo minute every other game when Kane is given a rest by being substituted late on, Abraham really staked his claim in a 27-goal debut season with Roma. But things have tailed off since for a striker whose international victims scream Three Lions heritage: Montenegro, Andorra and San Marino.",

      "“No matter how much money you have here, you can’t seem to get Rice Krispies,” Luther Blissett once remarked of life in Italy. But the man who scored a hat-trick on his international debut against Luxembourg still found a handful of England caps despite his relative struggles abroad.",

      "Marseille (6)",
      "When Marseille signed Trevor Steven for £5.5m in August 1991, it was the joint-highest fee involving a British player at the time. Then 27, the winger would stay around the England set-up, earning his last six international caps in France. Not bad to say he left after 12 months, and had only been capped five times in two years with Rangers.",
      "",
      "Torino (7)",
      "What a time to be alive this was. After his particular brand of Fronting Up reached a crescendo at Euro 2016, Hart was bombed out of the Manchester City starting line-up by Pep Guardiola but held on to his England shirt for a while, including during that weird loan in Italy where his name was listed as ‘John’ on a team sheet that one time, despite his actual name being neither that nor Joe, but instead Charles. Fair play. No chance you get away with calling yourself ‘Hartdog’ if your name is Charles.",

      "Real Madrid (11)",
      "Owen is not remembered all that fondly in Real Madrid – or any of his former clubs really – despite an impressive record of 17 goals in 26 starts. During his sole season in Spain, he retained his England place and duly netted six times in 11 matches. That included a hat-trick in a win over Colombia in May 2005 – six days after former club Liverpool had lifted the Champions League.",
      "",
      "Lazio (12)",
      "In total, 34 of Gascoigne’s 57 caps came while he was playing club football outside of England. He earned more caps in three years at Rangers (22) than in four with Tottenham (20), as well as 12 at Lazio and three with Middlesbrough. He was sadly never even called up while at Chinese second-tier side Gansu Tianma, despite boasting a record of two goals in four games.",

      "Real Madrid (13)",
      "UEFA once noted that ‘of all England’s footballing exports in the modern era, none was as successful as McManaman’. Yet even while he was scoring in Champions League finals and winning La Liga crowns, he was never truly a regular for his country.",
      "",
      "FC Koln (16)",
      "England’s 1982 World Cup squad contained three players each from Ipswich, Liverpool and Manchester United, two from Arsenal, Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and then one from Aston Villa, Brighton, Southampton and West Ham. Woodcock, then coming to the end of his first spell at FC Koln, was truly the odd one out.",
      "",
      "Inter Milan (17)",
      "Ince had just barely left Serie A by the time his most memorable and blood-soaked England performance came against Italy in October 1997. But the midfielder was in the midst of his Italian job during Euro ’96, where he was supposedly the designated sixth penalty taker in that semi-final shoot-out.",
      "",
      "Sampdoria (17)",
      "Paul Gascoigne emerged from the 1990 World Cup as a global superstar, but he was not the only England player to impress sufficiently to earn a move to Italy. In the same summer Gazza left Tottenham for Lazio, Walker departed his Nottingham Forest home to try his luck at Sampdoria. His time in Serie A was not quite so memorable, with Sven-Goran Eriksson playing him out of position at right-back in his only year outside of England, but he did keep his international place.",

      "Did you know that Waddle signed for Stocksbridge Park Steels in the same year a teenage Jamie Vardy joined their youth system? Well you bloody do now.",
      "",
      "Atletico Madrid (19)",
      "Two-and-a-half seasons of learning under the cojones of Simeone did absolutely nothing whatsoever to impact the England prospects of Trippier; it might even have strengthened them, considering it was somewhere around the defender’s move to Spain when Gareth Southgate decided that yeah, this man is also a left-back. It does not feel like a coincidence that he retired from international football straight after the manager resigned.",
      "",
      "Borussia Dortmund (22)",

      "Detroit Express (2), Sampdoria (20)",
      "Most will know that many of Francis’ England caps came during his spell in Sampdoria, but he also earned a couple of call-ups while on a weird kind of loan with NASL side Detroit Express. He headed to America at the end of the 1977/78 season with Birmingham, returned to become the first £1m footballer with Nottingham Forest in February 1979, then went back to Detroit that summer, never fully losing his grip on an England place.",
      "",
      "AC Milan (22)",
      "Far from damaging his England prospects, Wilkins found that his candle shone brighter away from the spotlight. He made nine and ten international appearances in 1985 and 1986 respectively – his two full calendar years in Italy. Only in 1982 (12) did he play more often for his country.",
      "",
      "Barcelona (24)",
      "Two players have won the World Cup Golden Boot outright without reaching the semi-finals at the same tournament. Much like James Rodriguez earned a move to Real Madrid with his exploits in 2014, Spain’s other giant saw fit to bring in Gary Lineker in 1986. He played 24 of a possible 25 England games as a Barcelona player, scoring 17 goals.",

He has allowed Declan Rice to have a bit more freedom to make his runs, and that is what Declan Rice likes to do.",
      "“He doesn`t like to sit down and Zubimendi is that type of player. He has aggression and can move the ball very intelligently as well. He has been a fantastic signing for Arsenal and has added a lot to the squad.",
      "“You need a big squad if you want to compete and Eze will definitely have more highlights and top moments this season. The injury of Martin Odegaard was definitely not helping him and Arsenal, because we know the importance of Odegaard. He triggers the press and the forward movements, but Eze has done a good job finding space and we will see more from him.",
      "“I think Gyokeres` movement has been impressive. He will continue to make those runs and move like this. It is not easy to be a number nine at Arsenal because it comes with a lot of responsibility, but we will see many goals from him. He will get the service, but of course it takes time to adapt to the Premier League. He will still have to find his feet, but we have seen some important goals already and it looks like he fits very well with the rest of the squad.”",

      "With Mbeumo going and Sesko having sustained an injury against Tottenham – though it’s not thought to be serious – there could be more minutes for Zirkzee.",

      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",
      "Talks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.",
      "Rico Henry",
      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",
      "He was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.",
      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",
      "He missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.",
      "James Milner",
      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",
      "Hurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.",
      "Martin Dubravka",
      "Dubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.",
      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",
      "Barnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.",
      "He then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.",
      "Marc Guehi",
      "Arguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.",
      "Rumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.",
      "Daichi Kamada",
      "Informal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.",
      "Naouirou Ahamada",
      "The 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.",
      "Nathaniel Clyne",
      "In his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.",
      "Clyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.",
      "Jefferson Lerma",
      "Lerma is a useful and reliable option for Oliver Glasner to turn to, especially as he looks to balance fixture congestion in domestic cup competitions and Europe.",
      "The Eagles hold an option to extend his stay at Selhurst Park for an additional year.",
      "Vitaliy Mykolenko",
      "Mykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.",
      "James Garner",
      "Garner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.",
      "Michael Keane",
      "Another mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.",
      "Keane, 32, reportedly has an option to extend his stay for an additional 12 months.",
      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",
      "He has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.",
      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",
      "Despite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
      "Freddie Woodman",
      "Woodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.",
      "In the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.",
      "Rhys Williams",
      "Even with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.",
      "Bernardo Silva",
      "Silva spoke openly about his future during the summer, outlining he is focused on the season but is aware he can leave the Etihad Stadium next summer.",
      "He continues to play a crucial role for Pep Guardiola's side and had options to leave but remained at the club.",
      "John Stones",
      "The future of John Stones is yet to be decided, with the England centre-back also approaching the end of his current deal.",
      "Stefan Ortega",
      "Ortega is now third-choice at the club following the arrivals of Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford. The German shot-stopper was linked as a potential target for Burnley in the summer.",

      "Signed in the summer before Trafford and Donnarumma arrived at the Etihad, Bettinelli is yet to make his debut for the club.",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "One of the more notable names approaching free agency. Maguire has enjoyed an upturn in his career at Old Trafford over the last two seasons.",
      "Maguire is not a regular starter under Ruben Amorim but adds crucial depth and experience. A one-year extension in his deal was triggered in January.",
      "Casemiro",
      "The club hold an option to extend Casemiro's stay by an additional year but there is a real possibility his contract is not renewed to free up space on the wage bill to strengthen the midfield area next season.",
      "Tom Heaton",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper behind Senne Lammens and Altay Bayindir at the club. Heaton has not featured for United since the 2022/23 season and will be 40 when his contract expires.",

      "Schar extended his contract at the club in April and has admitted he would be open to discussing a new deal with the Magpies, while speaking to The Chronicle in October.",

      "Emil Krafth",
      "Krafth signed an extension in February to keep him at the club until the end of the 2025/26 season. The Sweden international right-back has been rotated into the squad for domestic cup competitions and his agent has downplayed suggestions he could leave in January.",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",

      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United after his second spell came to a sour end following a bombshell interview in 2022; the Al Nassr forward says, despite an upturn in form at Old Trafford the Premier League club is not on the right path and needs to change",
      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""
