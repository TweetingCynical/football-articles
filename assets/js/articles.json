      "Marcus Rashford could finally fulfil his dream of playing at the Camp Nou this weekend. The on-loan Manchester United striker has previously spoken of his desire to play in front of Barcelona's fans at their iconic stadium after his career with the Spanish giants began at the Olympic Stadium.",
      "The Catalan side hadn't featured at the Camp Nou since 2023, instead staging matches at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium, whilst their home undergoes a massive £1.3 billion redevelopment scheme. However, the England international missed out on Barca's return last weekend due to illness.",
      "Barca enjoyed a successful homecoming at the Camp Nou as they defeated Athletic Bilbao 3-0, with Rashford forced to observe from the sidelines. Since Rashford completed the loan transfer to Barcelona he admitted that a significant factor in making the switch was the opportunity to feature at the iconic venue.",
      "He may now finally receive his opportunity with Barcelona welcoming Alaves in La Liga on Saturday afternoon. Upon joining Barca, Rashford said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable. Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in.\"",
      "He added: \"But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The ground's renovation is scheduled for completion in 2027, when its capacity will expand to 105,000, making it the fifth largest stadium in the world. The Catalan giants have also lodged an application with UEFA requesting permission to move their remaining Champions League home matches back to the Camp Nou this season.",
      "Rashford has netted six times and registered nine assists in 17 appearances across all competitions so far this term, with Barcelona trailing Real Madrid by just three points in La Liga.",
      "The 28-year-old has adapted well to his fresh start after his Old Trafford exit turned sour following a deterioration in his relationship with United manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Spanish media have given Rashford a glowing reception, lauding both his performances on the pitch and how quickly he's adjusted to his new life in Catalonia. Rashford, for his part, seems to be relishing his time in Spain.",
      "When asked by ESPN whether he wanted to remain at Barcelona and secure a permanent transfer, he replied: \"Oh yeah, for sure.\"",
      "He continued: \"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player it is an honour.\"",

      "Former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo believes ex-Red Devils midfielder Scott McTominay possesses precisely the qualities that manager Ruben Amorim desperately requires at Old Trafford. The 28-year-old netted a stunning opener during Scotland's 4-2 victory against Denmark this month and played a pivotal role in guiding the Tartan Army to their first World Cup since 1998.",
      "His remarkable bicycle kick capped off an exceptional 12 months for the midfielder. Following his departure from United to join Napoli in 2024, he secured the Serie A title and even received recognition with a Ballon d'Or nomination.",
      "Whilst United parted ways with the player, his outstanding displays may now have the club questioning their choice to offload him, particularly as Amorim is understood to be making a new midfielder his top priority.",
      "An attempted move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba collapsed during the summer window, whilst speculation continues linking the club with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, both targets who would command substantial transfer fees.",
      "Yet Ighalo, 36, is convinced the player United released possesses exactly what Amorim urgently requires at present. The Red Devils currently sit 10th in the Premier League standings following an erratic campaign.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is an interesting one because I think everything with him was just around timing,\" Ighalo told Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction.",
      "\"You know, he's doing so well since he left the club, but he had to leave because there were just too many players in his position around the place at the time.\"",
      "Highlighting four crucial qualities McTominay brings to the table, he added: \"It's funny because his style is probably something which Man United need now; he runs, he tackles, he works hard and he scores goals. He's a very humble guy who fits Man United's way of playing.",
      "\"His goal for Scotland last week was incredible... It's the kind of thing Cristiano Ronaldo does! What a goal; it was unbelievable. I can't say I ever saw him do anything like that in training at United, but he used to love to shoot and was always trying new things, so it didn't surprise me he scored it in that respect.",
      "\"He's the kind of player who will shoot from anywhere; he's so quick with his thinking and will happily take shots on first time, rather than controlling the ball and slowing things down.\"",
      "Much like McTominay, Ighalo unexpectedly became a beloved figure amongst United supporters. Arriving on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020, the Nigerian striker captured hearts at Old Trafford, largely due to his infectious personality.",
      "In his debut MUTV interview, Ighalo even disclosed that he accepted reduced wages to join United, such was his devotion to the club. The forward netted five times in 23 outings, earning himself a special place in supporters' affections with his name echoing around the Old Trafford stands.",
      "\"It's so hard to see this dream come to an end,\" Ighalo wrote when his loan spell concluded in January 2021. \"But I give God the glory for helping me fulfil this lifelong dream of putting on a Manchester United shirt as a player and represent this great club, it was indeed an honour I will forever cherish and be grateful for.\"",

      "Manchester United frontman Benjamin Sesko has not suffered a setback in his ongoing recovery from a knee injury. The Slovenia international missed Monday night's 1-0 defeat against Everton after sustaining the problem in the 2-2 draw at Tottenham earlier this month.",
      "Reports had claimed Sesko, 22, could be set for a lengthy spell on the side-lines after having a setback in his bid to return to full fitness. Ruben Amorim, meanwhile, said during his pre-Crystal Palace match press conference Sesko is going to take a \"little bit more time\" before making his return.",
      "United travel Palace on Sunday and entertain West Ham at home in midweek. That's before their trip to Wolves, meaning Sesko is expected to miss at least the next two games.",
      "Sesko, who signed for the Red Devils in a £67million plus add-ons deal from RB Leipzig in August, has scored just twice in 12 appearances since a big-money switch to Old Trafford. He found the net for the first time at Brentford before following that up with a strike against Sunderland a week after.",
      "As well as Sesko, Amorim is set to be without defender Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha for the trip to Selhurst Park. The Portuguese revealed, however, that Cunha could be back for the game against West Ham, while Maguire is expected to be out for a little longer.",
      "\"In our club it is the same thing because last year we had to win every game all the time and we took a lot of criticism because we are not winning,\" Amorim said, when asked if his side have to beat Palace.",
      "\"So in our club there is no excuses. About Europe, I've already talked about Europe and I said the same thing last year when we were still in Europe, and I say the same thing this year, the advantage and disadvantage of being in Europe so there is no excuses. Last year or this year, it's always to win games.\"",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will again be without strikers Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko for their trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday. The two forwards sat out of the 1-0 defeat by Everton on Monday due to injury and have not recovered in time to travel to Selhurst Park.",
      "Cunha picked up a knock in training over the weekend, compounding the absence of Sesko, who picked up a knee injury in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham before the international break. Amorim was therefore forced to hand Joshua Zirkzee his first Premier League start of the season against Everton.",
      "It did not go to plan, with United failing to score past Jordan Pickford, despite playing the vast majority of the match against 10 men after Idrissa Gueye was dismissed for slapping his team-mate Michael Keane. Supporters had been hopeful that Cunha would return for the Palace game, after Amorim described his knock as \"nothing serious\", but that is not the case.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time,\" Amorim told reporters in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"It will take a little bit longer and we are taking care of him. Harry [Maguire], the same. I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham on Thursday], not this one.\"",
      "Centre-back Maguire also sat out of the Everton game with a hamstring injury after Cunha was injured in training - news that leaked because he had to pull out of turning on the Christmas lights in Altrincham.",
      "Speaking about Cunha's issue before the Everton game, Amorim said: \"It was a knock in training so I don't know how long he's going to stay out, I think it's nothing serious, but we cannot risk players. We have to show everybody, when you are not 100 per cent, we have a different player to cope with the demands of the game.\"",
      "United had gone five games unbeaten in the Premier League before Kieran Dewsbury-Hall secured three points for 10-man Everton on Monday. It was a terrible result for Amorim, whose side had 25 shots and 69 per cent possession without scoring at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was really tough, the week was hard with this result, this defeat, but the process needs to continue and we need to go to the next game,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"If I look at the games, we should have more points. We had the advantage in some games and we lost control, which is really disappointing and frustrating, especially after the last game.\"",

      "Former Manchester United and Leeds star Alan Smith has revealed why he still has no feeling in three toes on his left foot. The ex-Premier League striker enjoyed a prolonged career with a total of 604 competitive appearances and 70 goals.",
      "Alongside spells at Old Trafford, Elland Road and Newcastle United, Smith is rather unfortunately well known for suffering one of the worst injuries Sir Alex Ferguson has ever seen. In an FA Cup clash against Liverpool, Smith broke his leg when rushing to block a powerful John Arne Riise free-kick.",
      "However, he has since revealed that he picked up an injury when playing for Newcastle that has resulted in worse consequences with him losing the feeling in three toes. The former England international, speaking via BritishGambler.co.uk said: \"It actually wasn't that one with Riise that made the ankle as bad as it was, because when I played in the derby for Newcastle against Sunderland, that’s when I did it again.",
      "\"I just got a tackle, Kieran Richardson came in, it was a bad tackle, but it wasn't malicious. He just came in and caught me on my standing foot, on my standing leg, but it was my left.",
      "\"He literally just went high on my ankle, and my ankle inverted, so the opposite of what it should and it just went inwards. That was worse because I already had all my metal work in there.",
      "\"I went to James Calder at the Fortius Clinic in London about it, because he'd done a lot of my surgeries after, and he basically couldn't tell what was new damage and what was old damage, and that's when I lost all the nerve damage in my foot, because I can’t feel the last three toes on my left side, I can't feel them.\"",
      "The 45-year-old discussed his leg break at Anfield from two decades ago and made it clear the injury was completely accidental. Smith said: \"Yeah, you're probably right I would charge and block the Riise free-kick again.",
      "\"When you look back at it, you know lads who have played and all ‘f****** put their bodies through all sorted, and they've all got ailments and can't walk and can’t do that, but that's what we were, that's what you do!",
      "\"Everyone says this and that about Riise, and I'm like, ‘f****** hell, he didn't do anything wrong!’ It wasn't a bad tackle. It was just unfortunate. You block it, you land, it goes underneath you, whatever it is.",
      "Despite such a big injury, Smith still plays casually and is also coaching in the United States. He has also kept active by taking up other sports.",
      "\"Yeah the body’s fine, because I don't really try and do anything to make it bad,\" he revealed when asked about his current state. \"Cycling, swimming... I think the key is to just try and keep doing something.",
      "\"It's trying to find that balance of doing something that doesn't make my ankle really bad so I'm struggling to walk, but doing enough to get movement in it. So it's doing okay.",
      "\"It’s just not stressing it too much because it's the inflammation then obviously the next day. I've been doing red light therapy on my ankle quite a bit and that's been helping it because it takes the inflammation down a lot. Just in the mornings when I'm getting going that I struggle with the ankle.\"",
      "On having pins in his ankle, he added: \"Yeah, I've got them in my left side. My left side I've got the screws in. The same screws from the operation!",
      "\"Some people take them out, but I always remember when I went to United Quinton Fortune had them in his knee, and then Quinnie got advice that he should take them out, and I always remember he took them out and then a few months later he did his knee again.",
      "\"So I've always though I'd rather leave him in and be on safe side than try and take him out and then, God forbid, all that happens.\"",

      "The Norwegian had just shy of three years in the role before he was given his marching orders. Solskjaer was the first ex-United player to be given the gig on a full-time basis following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement and enjoyed mixed results.",
      "Despite the team's fall in the post-Ferguson era there is still huge expectation on the Manchester outfit to perform. Ancelotti has led some of Europe's biggest names, the most noteworthy being Real Madrid. He's also been in charge at Bayern Munich, AC Milan, PSG and Chelsea.",
      "But Solskjaer claims he said on the spot that he wouldn't want the United job midway through a clash between Everton and the Red Devils.",
      "The 52-year-old told the BBC: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area. Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.'",
      "\"And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure. That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.",
      "\"But that pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way and that was having great staff around us, environment in and around the club was very positive, but in the end you need results. Unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Man Utd.\"",
      "Solskjaer had made strides forward during his United stint, but fell short of delivering a trophy, losing in numerous semi-finals and the Europa League final. It was a dire run that included a humiliating 5-0 loss to Liverpool at home which eventually led to his sacking. And the Norwegian claims that, given what he was up against, he couldn't have chosen a worse time to lead the club he played for.",
      "\"It's not about getting the credit,\" he said. \"It was the worst time to be manager of Man Utd. You have Jurgen Klopp with his Liverpool team and you have Pep Guardiola with his Man City team. The best managers in the world at the time, probably the best two teams in the world at the time. But we got second and third. So with the staff we had something going, but we couldn't take the next step.\"",

The Spanish giants have a buy option of €30 million (£26m) next summer, but it's not yet clear whether that will be triggered.",
      "The England star has scored six goals for Barcelona and provided another nine assists across all competitions. An injury to Raphinha has meant Rashford has been ever-present in Hansi Flick's starting XI, and it's understood he has left a good impression among teammates and staff.",
      "After a short loan spell at Aston Villa last season, Rashford secured his dream move to Camp Nou in the summer. As part of the switch, a future permanent fee of £26m was agreed, which would see the 28-year-old leave Manchester United for good.",
      "However, there is still no clear indication yet whether they will trigger that option. It's believed that a decision will be made later in the season, depending on how Rashford's form plays out between now and May.",
      "Now, another twist has emerged, with Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo providing insight into Flick's summer transfer plans and their impact on Rashford. The report states that Barcelona sporting director Deco and Flick have agreed that a left-footed centre-back, a winger and a centre-forward will all be prioritised.",
      "With Julian Alvarez being monitored alongside Harry Kane, Barcelona are planning for life without Robert Lewandowski, who will turn 38 by next summer. However, it's Barca's ambition to reinforce a versatile winger that could derail Rashford's permanent move.",
      "Flick has hardly utilised Rashford as a centre-forward this season but Raphinha's return from injury could spark a change in his place in the Barcelona team. Erling Haaland has also been mentioned as a possible target.",
      "The United loanee is namechecked in the report, but AC Milan's Rafael Leao has been mentioned as a possible alternative. There is also the possibility that Raphinha could leave amid interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "As a result, Rashford's future could be elsewhere, and Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly considering tempting him with a move to France. Mundo Deportivo have claimed that European champions are paying close attention to the England international and have set aside €50m (£43.8m) if they decide to move for him.",
      "Luis Enrique's side currently have one of most clinical forward lines in Europe with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Desire Doue and Bradley Barcola impressing behind Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele. Rashford's ability play on the left and as a striker could see him be a valuable target for the Parisians.",
      "Rashford still has two more years left on his contract at Old Trafford and under Ruben Amorim, it's unlikely that he will be offered another chance to return to the United squad. However, having shown flashes of his best in Spain, the chance of finding a permanent buyer shouldn't be as tough as before.",

      "The Argentina Football Association decided to change the rules mid-season which benefited Rosario, who won their first title since 1987. The change sparked a huge backlash in Argentina, with rival clubs furious that the goal posts had been moved.",
      "Former Manchester United and Chelsea midfielder Veron allegedly decided to order the Estudiantes players to protest against the decision. Estudiantes refused to give a guard of honour before their recent match, with the players turning their backs as the opponents walked onto the pitch.",
      "It came before their Clausura last-16 knockout match on Sunday, which Estudiantes won 1-0. The action caused a stir in Argentinian football and has now landed Veron and his players in hot water.",

      "Estudiantes’ players will serve their suspensions in the next tournament and at different times so it \"does not affect the integrity of the current competition\". It means they can feature in the Clausura quarter-final against Central Cordoba on Saturday.",
      "The controversy stems from the AFA’s call to change things around. Previously, the team with the highest points total only earned a place in the Copa Libertadores. But this time Rosario were declared champions after accruing a combined 66 points in the Apertura (opening) and Clausura (closing), the two tournaments that comprise the Primera Division.

      "Marcus Rashford's hopes of securing a permanent switch to Barcelona could be dashed by the club's ongoing money troubles. The Manchester United forward is currently flourishing at the Catalan giants on a season-long loan deal, having been frozen out by Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "So far this campaign, the 28-year-old has notched six goals and provided nine assists across 17 outings. With Barcelona possessing an option to make his switch permanent next summer for a fee around £30million, it appears straightforward if his present form continues.",
      "Yet La Liga commentator Terry Gibson has warned how the club's financial difficulties could scupper any deal. Other top players in his position, such as Raphinha and Lamine Yamal, also look set to play a role in his future.",
      "Gibson said: \"I think he's benefited from the fact that Rafinha's been injured and Yamal's been injured, [Robert] Lewandowski's been injured, Ferran Torres has been injured.",
      "\"So out of those four or five players, he's the only one that's been fit for every game this season - and he's benefited from that. He's played, he's been able to get up to speed, get some confidence, and he looks like a Barcelona player now.\"",
      "\"So I don't see any reason why they wouldn't sign him. You can't just rely on three. I think it's a push for him to be the first choice with those three. I think it's a given.",
      "\"Lewandowski up front, Yamal and Raphinha. I think after what they did last season, it's obvious that they will be the front three. But it doesn't always work out that all three are available.",
      "\"It doesn't work out because they're playing 60 games a season. And I think it's pretty certain, I think, that Barcelona will pay the fee to make that permanent.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the ex-United and Spurs midfielder admitted securing the necessary funds to permanently sign Rashford might prove challenging for Barcelona. He said: \"Well, it's not as easy to find £30m for Barcelona as it is normally.",
      "\"But back in the new stadium now, charging a fortune for tickets at the moment, 45,000 at the weekend, it's going to keep creeping up. And then Barcelona, before long, will be back on a familiar financial footing. And they'll be setting their sights very high to bring back in superstars at Barcelona.\"",
      "Reports emerged last month revealing Barca had accumulated a worrying transfer debt of approximately £138million following the publication of their 2024/25 financial accounts, sparking concerns about the club's long-term viability",
      "The figures also suggested the Catalan giants must settle £121million of that amount before the campaign concludes to remain financially stable. Such financial uncertainty could serve as a significant warning sign for Rashford in the long term, particularly as his prospects at United appear increasingly bleak.",
      "He might also raise concerns about supporter discontent at the club, particularly regarding ticket prices at Camp Nou, which is currently undergoing extensive renovation but has recently reopened with a reduced capacity of approximately 45,000.",
      "To put this into perspective, the most affordable ticket listed on the club's website for their fixture against Alaves on Saturday, November 29 costs £95.51 (€109), whilst the cheapest option for their encounter with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, December 2 stands at £148 (€169).",
      "Nevertheless, Rashford appears to have been impressed during his recent time in Spain. Speaking in September, he said: \"Playing for Barca is an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona.",
      "\"We want to win as much as possible. One hundred per cent I'm full of excitement. I'm very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It's so refreshing to play with these players.\"",

      "Two-time Premier League champion Joe Hart has admitted he \"never had a conversation\" with Carlos Tevez during their stint together at Manchester City. The former England shot-stopper confessed he never engaged in any meaningful dialogue with the Argentinian unless he was \"having an argument.\"",
      "Hart, 38, arrived at the Etihad from Shrewsbury Town in 2006 and had already established himself as City's No. 1 when Tevez made the controversial switch from Manchester United in 2009. But Hart revealed all on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, including how their relationship was strictly business for the most part.",
      "One might expect a squad capable of such historic success to be incredibly close-knit, with strong relationships forged away from the field. However, that wasn't quite the reality for that legendary City team, particularly between Hart and Tevez, who had previously been rivals in the Manchester derby.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "\"I always wanted to get on with everyone,\" said Hart. \"It's only when I look back and I laugh and I think, like I had nothing to do with the strikers unless I was having an argument with them, having banter. Knew nothing about them personally.",
      "\"And Carlos is a great example, Tevez. I was in a recent golf event with him, and I've never been slightly nervous to see someone again, because I've always got on with people. And Carlos, don't me wrong. [But] I never had a conversation with him.\"",
      "It's extraordinary to consider two team-mates could spend four years at the same club without engaging in any substantial dialogue. A language barrier certainly didn't help matters, particularly as Tevez has admitted he deliberately avoided learning English.",
      "Beyond their Premier League triumph together, Hart and Tevez also clinched the FA Cup one season prior in 2011. However, despite any apprehension Hart might have harboured about their eventual reunion, those concerns swiftly melted away in what proved to be a \"nice moment\" for both men.",
      "\"I worked with him a long time, but he didn't really have a conversation with many people,\" he continued. \"Because he was just focused, and I don't hold that against him. You don't have to be best friends.",
      "\"I was actually thinking, 'When I bump into him, is he even going to remember that we played together?' And then I bumped into him, and he couldn't have been more welcoming, delighted.",
      "\"And I was like, 'Carlos, I didn't even know if we were going to say hello. I remember you, you just said when I played, when I play, that was how I was.' He was just a totally different person. And it was quite a nice moment actually.\"",
      "Hart and Tevez were a bit of a culture shock in the City squad, hailing from two distinct eras of the club's history. Tevez was one of the big-ticket purchases made shortly after Abu Dhabi took over, while Hart was one of the few remnants of the pre-Abu Dhabi era who managed to keep his place in City's plans.",
      "It's understandable there was a difference in stature between the two, with Tevez being a much bigger star by the time he arrived at the Etihad. However, as it turns out, being on conversational terms isn't always necessary for achieving greatness together.",

      "Former Manchester United flop Antony dodged being shown a red card despite the Real Betis star appearing to headbutt an opponent in the Europa League on Thursday night.",
      "The La Liga side were taking on Dutch outfit Utrecht in Europe and Antony looked to have an unsavoury moment with their left-back Souffian El Karouani. The duo had several scuffles in the lead up to the incident, which occurred after 21 minutes.",
      "On this occasion they were battling for possession and El Karouani looked to grab hold of the winger, who clearly took issue, with footage showing that Antony appeared to take a look at the defender before aiming a headbutt in his direction.",
      "El Karouani immediately went down clutching his head, but Antony was not punished. The referee made no decision on the pitch and, even after VAR intervened to have a second look, his antics were cleared.",
      "Antony already knows he's facing one suspension after being sent-off in the final minute of their 1-1 draw over Girona last week - which means he will now miss the Andalusian derby against Betis' fierce rivals Sevilla this weekend.",
      "Utrecht will have been further angered by Antony's reprieve when he laid on Betis' opening goal of the night, scored by Cucho Hernandez. The Spanish side were without leading light Isco but still managed to maintain their unbeaten start in the Europa League as they sit in the qualification spots.",
      "Betis doubled their lead through Abde Ezzalzouli in the 50th minute and even though Utrecht pulled a goal back with an stunning strike from the halfway line courtesy of Miguel Rodriguez, it was still the Spaniards who picked up the three points.",
      "Antony will be glad he dodged a second red card in five days having been given his marching orders after kicking a Girona player in the face as he attempted an overhead kick. The winger, who made his move to Betis a permanent one in the summer, was initially shown a yellow card by the referee which was then upgraded after VAR recommended an on pitch review.",
      "Betis have attempted to appeal against Antony's three-match ban, but that was waved away and the club are now thought to be considering an appeal with to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.",

      "But what about those rarely-seen third strips? There are some beauties released this year - but also some absolute shockers.",
      "The City third kit was designed with the lovely Mancunian weather in mind. With a neon trim and unusual rain droplet design, this shirt has been criticised heavily by fans and rivals alike.",
      "The brightness of the neon paired with the dreary grey rain background has landed City at the bottom of the table - somewhere they are definitely not used to in recent years.",
      "£60 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "The Bees' third kit features a bright blue background with a brown and pink stripe across the breast of the top. The club's badge is centered in the middle of the chest with just a small brown and pink trim at the collar of the shirt.",
      "While the club's original colours are featured in this rare shirt, the placement of said hues do nothing to flatter the wearer and are rather mismatched across the entire design.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Brighton had the bright idea to stop the overconsumption of football merchandising by using last season's away kit as this year's third kit.",
      "The away kit has already been seen many times over the last year, which includes a yellow design with black vertical stripes and the club's badge standing out on the breast.",
      "While this kit is not unappealing on the eye, it is not new from last season so it lands low down on the list.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Tottenham's third kit for this season pays homage to the 1982 FA Cup winning team, with a vibrant yellow base and blue detailing around the chest and shoulders to give it a retro feel.",
      "However, the old-fashioned design is paired with the new sponsors and a disappearing neckline - as well as the surprise blue block of colour on the back - which makes it feel like a poor attempt at an old classic.",
      "£84.99 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "The 2025/26 third kit for Bournemouth is a pastel pink number with purple accents. Pink kits are coupled with success in the Cherries' recent history.",
      "They famously beat the likes of Newcastle and Crystal Palace away in the 2015/16 season to stay in the Premier League as fellow Championship hoppers Leicester City won the title that same year.",
      "It is relatively basic so isn't any higher on the list for this reason.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "West Ham's alternative kit is a new take on a pretty plain classic. The badge is enlarged and features only the two famous hammers which are synonymous with the club.",
      "Other than this unique feature, the rest of the shirt is not exceptional with gold accents and a split collar.",
      "£67.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Newcastle's strip is a throwback to their European adventures in the late 1990s. The kit, which features a navy blue base with orange accents, is inspired by their 1997 Champions League season.",
      "This season featured a famous 3-2 win against Barcelona and a 2-0 win over Dynamo Kyiv too. However, it isn't anything special so is midtable in this list.",
      "£84 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Nottingham Forest have followed the Adidas trend of the slim bars down the sides of the kit giving a feel of the iconic strips from the 90s. This third shirt is a navy blue and black design with red hems in a smart colour contrast.",
      "However, as with many of the midtable strips, this isn't exactly blowing anybody's socks off.",
      "£75 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Everton went more out of the box with their third kit design that stands out among the rest - but not exactly for the best reasons. The black base features yellow and blue zigzag patterns in a horizontal fashion across the entire top, which is said to be inspired by the areas surrounding the new Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "While it is admirable that the Toffees have branched out more in their third kit design, a lot is left to be said for the choices made.",
      "£48 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Leeds United are another team who went all or nothing with their alternative strip. The blue, yellow and black design, created by Adidas, is said to mimic the raucous home support at Elland Road.",
      "It gives more rave or DJ vibes than a football strip but credit must be given for the creativity of the design.",
      "£45.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "FA Cup winners Crystal Palace have gone back to basics with their third strip and it is unlucky not to be higher on this list. The red and blue stripe straight down the middle coupled with one red and one blue sleeve topper is easy on the eye and a cool choice.",
      "The only thing that docks points off this kit is the amount of sponsors on the sleeves and front of the shirt that ruin the look. A no sponsor version would gain about five places in this list alone.",
      "£86 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Aston Villa's alternative kit gives shades of the Japan cherry blossom jersey. The shirt is said to be inspired by stained glass windows and features a white base with shades of blue and purple across the shoulders.",
      "The long-sleeved version is much cooler than the short sleeve and is a pretty nice one in this list.",
      "£59.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Anybody else get Wetherspoons plate vibes here? The Wolves third kit is a lot to look at but it is a beautiful shade of ocean blue.",
      "This design is said to be inspired by the energy and spirit of Brazil, and fans sure are hoping the football begins to replicate some tiki-taka skills soon enough.",
      "£60 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "This is a trend that begins at seventh place and it is that black kits automatically get a major pass.",
      "Burnley's third strip is similar to one another in this list but is one place lower due to the unusual gold specks that adorn the shoulder and hip of the shirt.",
      "It is an interesting kit but nothing too special to climb up the rankings further.",
      "£48 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "And here we have the other black-and-gold kit on this list. Fulham's alternative strip is clean and fresh, with a black base and gold piping all around the edges of the top.",
      "While it is plain, it does the job and could be swapped with any other club's badge to work seamlessly.",
      "£68 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "A shirt with a collar as unusual as this deserves its spot in fifth place. The Chelsea third kit is a middle badge, blacked-out piece of beauty.",
      "The white neck trim that mimics a wide collar is perhaps the most interesting part of the strip and pulls it up to a higher place on the list than initially expected.",
      "£84.99 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Many will be surprised that this kit isn't higher given the fan reaction. The Liverpool alternative top is a bright blue-green colour and features a vintage club badge that complements the shirt beautifully.",
      "Once again, the long-sleeved version is a much more appealing view than the short-sleeve, so it is docked points for that reason.",
      "£52 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Arsenal rarely miss when it comes to kit releases and the 2025/26 season is no different. This third kit is designed to celebrated 20 years since Arsenal's last season at Highbury and is another strip with an alternative badge.",
      "Featuring just the iconic cannon of the Gunners, this kit is white with a traditional collar and red accents with some gold smuggled in.",
      "£85 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Manchester United may have some chaos on the pitch, but their kits always seem to hit the spot. The Red Devils third top pays homage to the iconic 1993-95 away shirt, also known as the 'Cantona Kit'.",
      "The black-out kit with blue and yellow edges gives the top a fresh look and is finished with the original Adidas trefoil badge.",
      "£56.95 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "And finally, we have a kit absolutely deserving of its crown. Sunderland have just returned to the Premier League but are impressing on the pitch and also in their kit releases.",
      "The third kit features 11 mandalas intermixed in the blacked-out base, with a unique black cat emblem used as the club badge.",
      "Perhaps the most cool part of this kit is the pair of amber cat eyes on the back of the neck of the top, meant to symbolise past battles and focus on the future.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui each look destined for AFCON selection and will soon take a leave of absence. As if that didn't hamper the manager's selection enough, United's discipline (or lack thereof) could take another two players out of action.",
      "As if the impending exodus of AFCON-eligible players wasn't bad enough, suspensions could be incoming for both Casemiro and Patrick Dorgu. Each of the pair are just one caution away from meeting the five-booking threshold that would incur a one-game ban in each case.",
      "United, who sit 10th in the Premier League at present, could do with all the resources they can muster for a tough winter schedule. And it means both Casemiro and Dorgu will need to be on their best behaviour at Selhurst Park this weekend.",
      "And it may influence Amorim's selection for what's shaping up to be a very difficult trip to south London. Palace are undefeated in three and sit fifth, while United have gone more than a month without a win and slipped down to mid-table.",
      "On one hand, United's chief may prefer his players get booked sooner rather than later in order to get their suspensions out of the way before the AFCON exodus. On the other, he'll want to preserve their disciplinary record for as long as possible in the hopes neither Casemiro nor Dorgu hit the five-card limit.",
      "One of the major transfer stories developing at United concerns Casemiro, whose contract at Old Trafford expires next summer. And although the club retains the option to extend his stay by another 12 months, rumours have emerged touting Conor Gallagher as his preferred replacement.",
      "That storyline is now gathering pace after AS reported Amorim's side are at the head of the queue to land the Atletico Madrid midfielder. Gallagher, 25, was all but indispensable during his debut season under Diego Simeone last term but has since taken a backseat in recent months.",
      "The former Chelsea and Crystal Palace talisman has started just five games across all competitions so far this season. Atletico signed the player for a bargain fee of only £34million almost 18 months ago, though it's thought the Spanish giants would demand closer to £50m if they're to sell up in 2026.",
      "Gallagher, who is supposedly \"not satisified\" with his bit-part role at Atleti, would also come with added benefit that he would contribute towards United's quota of homegrown players. And he could even help get a little more out of former Chelsea comrade and fellow Blues academy graduate Mason Mount.",
      "There are understood to be concerns at United regarding the club's over-reliance on midfield stars like Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. However, a Premier League comeback for Gallagher could give the squad a new all-action alternative fit for the role.",

      "Former Manchester United star Bastian Schweinsteiger wants Red Devils target Angelo Stiller to sign for Bayern Munich. The Stuttgart ace is one of a number of options United are said to be looking at.",
      "The Germany international was linked with an Old Trafford switch in the summer as United turn their attention to landing a central midfielder. Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Joao Gomes are among the primary names being considered to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Stiller remains under contract until June 2028 and according to Sky Deutschland, Stuttgart value the player at £44million. A deal at that price would see him become the club's second-most expensive exit, following Nick Woltemade's move to Newcastle in the summer.",
      "But Schweinsteiger hopes to see Stiller remain in the Bundesliga; the 2014 World Cup winner would much rather see the 24-year-old return to the club where he started his career. \"Angelo is a very interesting player,\" said Schweinsteiger during a recent event with the Kings League. \"I would very much like to see him back at Bayern Munich.\"",
      "Stiller is drawing interest from around Europe and has also been linked to Real Madrid. The midfielder has notched one goal and six assists in 19 appearances this season.",

      "He said: \"He has a contract with us. It's far too early to speculate about that. Of course, one or two clubs will have had their eye on him. He's having an outstanding season.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly planning to bolster their wing-back and midfield options next summer, but they haven't ruled out making moves in the upcoming transfer window. ESPN reports that the Red Devils will likely approach January with caution.",
      "The club had a busy summer, welcoming six new faces to Ruben Amorim's squad, sparking rumours that more signings could be on the horizon. Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens, and Diego Leon all made the move to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, costing the club a hefty £236million.",
      "Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Hove Albion was also heavily linked with a move to United, but a deal failed to materialise. ESPN suggests that alongside Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are among the names being considered as potential midfield targets. United have also reportedly been eyeing up moves for Wolves pair Joao Gomes and Andre, as well as Angelo Stiller and Conor Gallagher.",
      "It's believed that United's recruitment strategy for next summer will focus on bringing in 'at least one' top-level midfielder.",
      "Casemiro, whose contract expires in the summer, could be offered a new deal on reduced terms.",
      "However, United may decide to sever ties and seek a long-term solution. Despite this, Manuel Ugarte has yet to prove himself as United's first-choice defensive midfielder.",
      "While a bit of transfer activity could be on the cards in January, ESPN suggests that 'nothing has been ruled out,' but the majority of their dealings are likely to be postponed until the summer.",
      "Next month, Amorim will have to make do without Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui due to their commitments at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Sesko is currently nursing a knee injury he picked up against Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, it seems that Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, two of the club's top earners, may be heading for pastures new away from Old Trafford.",
      "Despite splashing the cash on new signings last summer, the club feels that 'there are limitations' with the squad currently available to Amorim.",

      "Rashford has joined Barcelona on-loan, with a view to making the move permanent next summer. Sancho is on-loan at Aston Villa, and will leave United on a free transfer in the close season.",
      "Saha said: \"The squad is much more harmonious. It's the best transfer you can make. When you have one player that is not pulling their weight, you can just about manage.",
      "\"You can leave them out of the side, and the rest of the squad can cope. But when you have three or four players who are really talented, but just arent at the races, then it drags the team down a level.",
      "\"It's really hard for the manager to turn that situation around, so I think it's very important to act decisively in situations like that.",
      "\"So Amorim got rid of them. He replaced them with (Benjamin) Sesko, (Bryan) Mbeumo and (Matheus) Cunha, and now United are playing at a higher level than what we had before.",

      "Speaking to Pundit Arena, the former France international added: \"I think that was the main goal for United in the transfer market. Players who thought about themselves above the team, they needed to go.",
      "\"The squad is more balanced now. You need at least three quarters of your team to be dedicated, willing to sacrifice, and talented too.",

      "Manchester United's Patrick Dorgu has stirred the pot by liking a social media post criticising Ruben Amorim's midfield selection of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. The Red Devils have had a rocky start to the season, currently sitting 10th in the Premier League with just five victories from their first 12 matches.",
      "Despite impressive wins such as their triumph over Liverpool at Anfield, their recent defeat to Everton at Old Trafford has dampened spirits. A key feature of United's strategy this season has been the midfield duo of skipper Fernandes and Casemiro.",
      "Both players were on the pitch for the disappointing 1-0 loss to the Toffees on Monday night, until Casemiro was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo just shy of the 60-minute mark after picking up a booking.",
      "However, it seems not everyone in the dressing room is on board with the manager's current player use. Dorgu gave his approval to an Instagram post arguing that Fernandes and Casemiro should not be playing together.",
      "The post, shared by \"mufcunion\", featured a screenshot from X which read: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "The caption of the Instagram post declared: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" and received a like from Dorgu, who joined United from Lecce for £25m earlier this year. The wing-back has made 12 appearances across all competitions this season, contributing one assist.",
      "Fernandes and Casemiro have been a formidable duo for Manchester United this season, starting together in 10 out of the club's 13 matches across all competitions.",
      "The only exceptions were during a heavily rotated squad against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round, and two league games against Brentford and Manchester City.",
      "In those matches, Manuel Ugarte was chosen to partner Fernandes in place of Casemiro. However, the selection for the Brentford match was enforced due to Casemiro receiving a red card in the previous game against Chelsea.",
      "Casemiro's future at Old Trafford is currently up in the air as his contract nears its end. Despite having a better season compared to the last, it remains unclear whether the 33-year-old Brazilian will extend his stay with United.",
      "This has led to United being linked with several midfield reinforcements over the summer, including Brighton's Carlos Baleba, while Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is the latest name to be thrown into the mix ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "However, such social media activity from Dorgu criticising the manager's selection decisions does not bode well for him, the manager or his teammates.",

      "A hamstring injury has limited the midfielder to just three Championship starts so far this season. Collyer returned earlier this month and was even deemed fit enough to start in Wednesday evening’s clash with Birmingham City.",
      "But Collyer’s return to the starting line-up lasted for just 11 minutes before he picked up another issue and was forced to depart. And West Brom boss Ryan Mason has claimed that his issue is a recurrence of an injury that has been blighting him for the past few years.",
      "\"It's a muscle injury, yes,\" Mason said. \"I think it's challenging for him, it's disappointing.",
      "\"He had a few last season at Man United, that's why I was very patient with him this season because I wanted to give him the best opportunity to grow into the demands of this league.",
      "\"But for something to happen after 10 minutes, it's disappointing. It looks like it (a hamstring issue). We'll assess him in the next couple of days and see where we're at with that.\"",
      "Collyer’s issue represents a fresh blow to the midfielder's hopes of adding some much-needed experience to his CV. Speaking earlier this month, Mason said: \"Toby's a young player, but we know we're going to need him and he's going to help us. I've wanted Toby for a few weeks now. He's someone that I really believe in, which is important and I have that belief in all of my players.",
      "\"But when you go on loan to somewhere, I think you need to feel like you're wanted from the club and the manager and he certainly is that. Hopefully we can help him because if we help him improve and grow as a player, then it's certainly going to be beneficial to us.",
      "\"I think there's loads of room and loads of growth to develop. That's certainly going to happen on the training pitch. The reality is the game is the best teacher.",
      "\"The more game exposure you can get, the better, especially at a young age. I'm sure and I expect that Toby knows that I believe in him, which for me is super important.",
      "\"I'm going to put a lot of energy, the same amount of energy that I've put into him as every other one of my players, to help them grow and improve.\"",

      "David Moyes' side went on to secure a 1-0 victory despite being reduced to 10 men for more than 80 minutes. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall netted the only goal shortly after Gueye's dismissal, and the Toffees managed to hold firm and claim a massive three points.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "Lescott, who played alongside Gueye at Aston Villa during the 2015/16 season, has since spoken with his former team-mate. And he offered reassurance to the Senegal international, as revealed on the latest episode of In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet",
      "\"We've seen it with Idrissa as well, and I spoke to him after that and he was like, 'That was so out of character,'\" said Lescott. \"But I said, this happens, you're allowed to be out of character for one moment, you know what I mean? It's not like it's happened every week. It is okay.\"",
      "Everton took all three points from Old Trafford despite managing only 30% possession. They also registered just three shots at goal compared to United's 25, with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford making one particularly vital save from Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Former England goalkeeper and podcast guest Joe Hart even suggested Gueye's dismissal could have been a blessing in disguise. While Everton wouldn't deliberately choose to play with 10 men, the team responded magnificently to the early blow and showed tremendous character when their task became significantly harder.",
      "\"Actually, in the hindsight of them winning the game, it's a massive moment. It can be a really big moment, good moment,\" said Hart. \"But it didn't feel right at the time. I was watching it thinking, 'What?' These are these are high emotional moments, you know.\"",
      "Gueye has since apologised to his Everton team-mates and reportedly spoke directly to Keane following Monday's result. However, he must still serve a three-match suspension that will rule him out during a crucial part of the winter schedule.",
      "In all probability, Gueye will link up with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations and would have been unavailable regardless. Nevertheless, he will miss at least the forthcoming matches against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest.",
      "Lescott completed his final campaign in English football with Villa, while Gueye was still establishing himself in the Premier League when their paths crossed. After receiving support from his former colleague on Monday, Gueye issued a public apology for his conduct and abandoning his team-mates.",
      "\"I want to apologise first to Michael Keane,\" he said in a heartfelt post on social media. \"I take full responsibility for my reaction. I also apologise to my teammates, the staff, the fans and the club.",

United will need to find a way to improve their record on the road if they are to secure Champions League qualification.",

I've felt the intensity at home has been higher. But against Everton, it was not on the same level.",

There are no excuses. About Europe, I've already talked about Europe and I said the same thing last year when we were in Europe. And I say the same thing this year: there are advantages and disadvantages of not being in Europe, so there are no excuses last year or this year, we always have to win games.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has spoken to the media ahead of the trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday lunchtime.",
      "Amorim confirmed he will be missing Benjamin Sesko as expected for the game at Selhurst Park. Matheus Cunha is also out but could be fit in time for the midweek fixture against West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire is also out of the game as he takes further time to recuperate from the injury he received at Tottenham. Amorim was also quizzed about the comparisons that can be drawn between United and Palace as they both play the same 3-2-4-1 system.",
      "The topic of signing wing-backs was also mentioned but Amorim was keen not to delve too deeply into replacing specific positions. Meanwhile, questions were asked about the club's away form and what can be done to improve that.",
      "Take a look back at everything Amorim had to say in his press conference below:",
      "That is all from the first part of Amorim's press conference. Those first quotes have been tidied up now.",
      "We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I say that in the last year and to give an example, the last game, we should have had enough with the right foot to put on the other side to play against ten men. It is these kind of characteristics, with time, we will try to get to be a better team so are we the perfect set-up to play in this way? Not yet but like every team we need time to put the right characteristics into every position to prepare them.",
      "I don't know how you read data [on Palace wing-backs] maybe they play more games, more minutes so you can't compare the data. We make a lot of substitutions and sometimes we change because we know that is a different position or you want to change the feet with Dalot and Patrick. Sometimes we start with Amad in front but most of the time if we need to win the game, I put Amad on the right. Amad changes position all the time and that can change all the data and you see different things. But again, they are doing the things really well. They play more in transition than us. The opponents see it in a different way so all of these things we have to look when we compare teams. But in every position we can do so much better.",
      "We play a different way and you can understand that by data but it is hard to explain everything. It is a different club and they are doing that better than us so that is quite simple but you don't say all 4-3-3 play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in different space and we try to attack in a different way and they are just doing things better than us.",
      "I play against him [Glasner] at Frankfurt with Sporting so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I have two weeks for national teams, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration that I can take. I have six years as a manager and I am always trying to learn to improve my team.",
      "The same things that we need to do to show to the players why we lost control of Forest why we lost control against Tottenham. And if you look at those games they were there to win. Sometimes a small detail can change everything. Then I felt this year when we play at home the intensity is higher and I felt in this game at home the intensity was not at the same level so I think it is something that we need to work on. It is hard to point at one thing why we are not winning away. There is a lot of issues that we are improving. Like I say, we have advantage in the away games but we need to know how to finish the games in order to win.",
      "If you look at the game we can play better. Everything that happened in that game, we should have won that game, we have to feel that urgency of winning games. We know what happens around the club if we do not win games. If we know that, let's do everything in the right way but again, we lost that one. We cannot change that, let's focus on the next one.",
      "Sesko is going to take a little bit more time, Harry [Maguire] the same. I expect to have Matheus back in the next one not this one.",
      "No, no, no setback [for Sesko]. We are taking care of the injury.",
      "It is to start again and it was really tough the week as it should be. It was hard after this result, this defeat. But the process needs to continue and we need to go for the next game and we have to understand, especially in our league this year, everything can change really fast so let's go again and focus on the next one.",
      "In our club it is the same thing because last year we had to win every game all the time and we took a lot of criticism because we are not winning. So in our club there is no excuses. About Europe, I have already talked about Europe and I said the same thing last year when we were in Europe, and I say the same thing this year, the advantage and disadvantage of being in Europe so there is no excuses. Last year or this year it is always to win games.",
      "If I look at the games we should have more points because we had control of some games, we had the advantage in some games and we lost that control. So if I look at our games we should have more points and that is really disappointing and really frustrating especially in the last game.",
      "Amorim is here and it is time for the press conference. Keep an eye out for updates shortly...",
      "Amorim has just started speaking to the United press pack at Carrington. Remember the press conference is embargoed until 1.30pm but we will get you the quotes as soon as we can!",
      "Amorim surprised many of us on Monday when he chose to start Zirkzee as the No.9 against Everton. Before that game, he had only played 90 minutes over five appearances but it was a show of confidence from the manager to throw him in. Sadly, the risk did not work and the United boss could be asked questions over where he sees Zirkzee starting at Palace.",
      "Here is what we expect Amorim to be asked about and speak on in his press conference this afternoon:",
      "We are just one hour away from Amorim's press conference being broadcast. The Portuguese head coach will be speaking to the media at 1.15pm with the embargo being lifted at 1.30pm. Stay tuned for the updates from Carrington right here...",
      "United believes the chance to host the FIFA 2035 women's World Cup is a \"brilliant opportunity.\" United and the city region have been aligned with the aim of bringing significant fixtures at the World Cup in 2035 to the stadium, including the final of the tournament. United withdrew Old Trafford from the list of venues for the 2028 men's European Championship because they were considering its future and could not commit to being a host venue. However, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has earmarked the 2030/31 season for United to move into the new 100,000-seater Old Trafford.",

      "Teenage midfielder Cristian Orozco is set to travel to the United Kingdom ahead of his move to Manchester United, who have a preliminary agreement to sign the Colombian. Orozco, 17, plays for Fortaleza CEIF and has captained Colombia's Under-17 team. The defensive midfielder helped Colombia reach the final of the U17 South American Championship in the spring, and United have identified him as an exciting young talent with first-team potential.",

      "Another game, another potential United audition in the opposition ranks. This time it is the turn of Palace's Wharton to take centre stage as the Reds continue to have an eye on midfield options. MEN Sport has taken a look at why the audition may not necessarily be a ringing endorsement for signing the England international.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "In an interview with DAZN Portugal this week, Amorim admitted he is willing to change his tactic despite criticism he is too wedded to the 3-2-4-1 system. The Portuguese head coach could be quizzed on this in his press conference later and it will be interesting to see how he responds.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Heading into today's press conference we can expect to hear about the latest on the injury issues affecting United. Sesko is likely to be overlooked considering Amorim put a timeline of 'a few weeks' on his potential return. Cunha and Maguire have more chance of being fit for Sunday. Maguire was training at Carrington during the international break but his recovery needed longer. Cunha's injury was deemed 'nothing serious' on Monday night so there's a chance he could play Sunday.",
      "United are looking to bounce back this weekend against Palace after the dismal display vs Everton. Their best chance of doing that would be to have their strongest line-up available to them for the trip to Selhurst Park. However, our United writer Steven Railston believes the club needs a double injury boost to be able to do just that.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will address the media today and we will have his quotes at 1.30pm.",
      "Amorim's attitude today will be interesting after his players put in a poor performance in the defeat to Everton on Monday night. The Reds desperately need a response on Sunday to show the result was merely a blip after a good run of form.",
      "Keep across this blog throughout the day for updates...."

      "Ronaldo plays for Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr, having penned a fresh two-year deal with the club in June that will see him remain until he reaches 42.",
      "The Portuguese legend is also gearing up to feature for his country at next summer's World Cup in North America, marking his sixth tournament appearance.",
      "However, Ronaldo has acknowledged that it will mark his final mark on football's biggest stage. Speaking at the Tourise Summit in Riyadh earlier this month, Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed that the 2026 World Cup will be his last.",
      "\"Definitely, yes,\" he said. \" I will be 41-years-old and I think [this] will be the moment in the big competition.\"",
      "During a previous interview, Ronaldo hinted at retirement soon, but he clarified those comments. \"Let's be honest, when I mean soon, it's probably one or two years I'll still be at the game,\" he explained.",
      "Ronaldo's business ventures extend beyond football, with investments in MMA, hotels and gyms back in Portugal.",
      "The former United man is also the face of the CR7 lifestyle brand and has a lifetime contract with sportswear giant Nike - reportedly worth a staggering $1billion (£760million).",

      "Juan Sebastian Veron has been slapped with a six-month ban from all football-related activities following a major controversy in Argentine football. Veron serves as club president for Estudiantes, who declined to provide a guard of honour to Rosario Central after they were contentiously crowned champions.",
      "The Argentina Football Association (AFA) opted to alter the regulations mid-campaign, which favoured Rosario in securing their first title since 1987. The modification triggered enormous outrage across Argentina, with competing clubs incensed that the parameters had been shifted.",
      "Ex-Manchester United and Chelsea midfielder Veron reportedly instructed the Estudiantes squad to demonstrate against the ruling.",
      "Estudiantes declined to offer a guard of honour prior to their recent fixture, with the players turning away as their opponents entered the pitch.",
      "The occurred before a last-16 knockout encounter on Sunday, which Estudiantes secured 1-0. The gesture created significant controversy in Argentine football and has, subsequently, resulted in sanctions for Veron and his players.",
      "The AFA's disciplinary panel determined that the 50-year-old - who won 72 caps for his country - was accountable for fostering \"an attitude of open disapproval\" which represented \"a form of symbolic violence and an affront to the values of respect and sportsmanship.\"",
      "In 2001, United signed Veron for £28.1million, which was a British transfer record fee at the time. Over two decades later, Liverpool smashed that ever-developing record when they signed Alexander Isak, for an eye-watering £125m.",
      "At the turn of the century, Sir Aex Ferguson had admitted that he \"never though the day would arrive\" that he would have \"spent this much money on one player.\" Veron went on to play 51 games for United - scoring seven goals - while he won the Premier League in 2003.",
      "Now, he has been handed \"a six-month suspension from all football-related activities\", while the players who \"engaged in the reprehensible conduct\" have each been banned for two matches, with club captain Santiago Nunez also stripped of the armband for three months.",
      "Estudiantes' players will serve their bans in the next tournament and at staggered intervals so it \"does not affect the integrity of the current competition.\"",
      "It means they remain eligible for the Clausura quarter-final clash against Central Cordoba on Saturday. The anger originated from the AFA's decision to shake things up. Previously, the side with the most points simply secured a Copa Libertadores berth.",
      "However, this time, Rosario were crowned as champions after amassing a combined 66 points across the Apertura (opening) and Clausura (closing), the two competitions that makeup the Primera Division. That tally was four points superior to runners-up Boca Juniors.",
      "Remarkably, it means that, despite lifting the title, Rosario's campaign has concluded following their 1-0 defeat to Estudiantes. The season continues, however, with Estudiantes progressing in the Clausura knockout rounds.",
      "Whatever team triumphs in the Clausura will meet Apertura winners Platense in the end-of-season Champions Trophy, which formerly determined Argentina's champions.",
      "A statement from Estudiantes read: \"Analysing the sanction received in detail, in order to take the appropriate measures to defend the interests of the institution and its members. In this context, the board of directors expresses its full support for its president Juan Sebastian Veron, Santiago Nunez and the entire professional squad.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford's potential of moving to Barcelona permanently could be hindered by a potential lack of club funds.",
      "The Manchester United star is currently thriving with the Catalan giants on a season-long loan, after falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. This season thus far, the 28-year-old has racked up six goals and nine assists from 17 appearances.",
      "And with Barcelona holding an option to make his move permanent next summer for an amount bordering £30milion, it seems like a no brainer if his current form holds up. However, La Liga commentator, Terry Gibson, has highlighted how the club's current financial state could prevent a deal from coming to fruition.",
      "When asked about how the presence of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha impact Rashford's future at the Camp Nou, Gibson exclusively told the MEN: \"I think he's benefited from the fact that Rafinha's been injured and Yamal's been injured, [Robert] Lewandowski's been injured, Ferran Torres has been injured.",
      "\"So out of those four or five players, he's the only one that's been fit for every game this season - and he's benefited from that. He's played, he's been able to get up to speed, get some confidence, and he looks like a Barcelona player now.",
      "\"So I don't see any reason why they wouldn't sign him. You can't just rely on three. I think it's a push for him to be the first choice with those three. I think it's a given.",
      "\"Lewandowski up front, Yamal and Raphinha. I think after what they did last season, it's obvious that they will be the front three. But it doesn't always work out that all three are available.",
      "\"It doesn't work out because they're playing 60 games a season. And I think it's pretty certain, I think, that Barcelona will pay the fee to make that permanent.\"",
      "However, the former United and Tottenham Hotspur star also conceded that it may not be a simple task for Barcelona to find the funds to complete Rashford's permanent transfer. He explained: \"Well, it's not as easy to find £30m for Barcelona as it is normally.",
      "\"But back in the new stadium now, charging a fortune for tickets at the moment, 45,000 at the weekend, it's going to keep creeping up. And then Barcelona, before long, will be back on a familiar financial footing. And they'll be setting their sights very high to bring back in superstars at Barcelona.\"",
      "Last month, it was reported that Barca had accrued an alarming transfer fee debt of around £138m after publishing their financial report for 2024/25, raising questions with regards to the long-term sustainability of the club. It was also claimed that the club will have to clear £121m of that sum by season's end to stay afloat.",
      "Rashford could see this as a major red flag in the long run, especially given his future with United is seemingly non-existent at present.",
      "He could also take issue with fan unrest at the club, given the price of tickets at Camp Nou, which is currently undergoing major refurbishment but recently opened once again at a limited-capacity of around 45,000.",
      "For context, the cheapest ticket available on the club's website for their clash with Alaves come Saturday, November 29 is £95.51 (€109), while the most cost-efficient ticket for their match with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, December 2 comes in at £148 (€169).",
      "However, Rashford has seemingly been impressed with his time on Spanish soil as of late. Speaking in September, he said: \"Playing for Barca is an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona.",
      "\"We want to win as much as possible. One hundred per cent I'm full of excitement. I'm very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It's so refreshing to play with these players.\"",
      "UK football fans can listen to Terry Gibson on co-commentary for Sevilla FC vs Real Betis on Premier Sports 1 come Sunday, November 30 at 3.10pm. FC Barcelona vs Atletico de Madrid is also available on Premier Sports 1 from 1.55pm on Tuesday, December 2.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Alan Smith has revealed the reason behind his permanent loss of sensation in three toes on his left foot. The ex-Premier League forward had an illustrious career, playing 604 competitive matches and scoring 70 goals.",
      "Smith, who also had spells at Elland Road and Newcastle United, is notorious for suffering what Sir Alex Ferguson described as one of the most horrific injuries he'd ever seen. This gruesome incident took place during an FA Cup match against Liverpool, when Smith broke his leg trying to block a free-kick from John Arne Riise.",
      "However, Smith has now revealed that a separate injury he sustained while playing for Newcastle United has caused him more lasting damage, resulting in the loss of feeling in three toes. He said: \"It actually wasn't that one with Riise that made the ankle as bad as it was.",
      "\"When I played in the derby for Newcastle against Sunderland, that's when I did it again. I just got a tackle, Kieran Richardson came in, it was a bad tackle, but it wasn't malicious. He just came in and caught me on my standing foot, on my standing leg, but it was my left.",
      "\"He literally just went high on my ankle, and my ankle inverted, so the opposite of what it should and it just went inwards. That was worse because I already had all my metal work in there.",
      "\"I went to James Calder at the Fortius Clinic in London about it, because he'd done a lot of my surgeries after, and he basically couldn't tell what was new damage and what was old damage, and that's when I lost all the nerve damage in my foot, because I can't feel the last three toes on my left side, I can't feel them.\"",
      "The 45-year-old reflected on his leg break at Anfield two decades ago, maintaining the injury was completely accidental. Smith confessed: \"Yeah, you're probably right I would charge and block the Riise free-kick again.",
      "\"When you look back at it, you know lads who have played and all f****** put their bodies through all sorts, and they've all got ailments and can't walk and can't do that, but that's what we were, that's what you do!",
      "\"Everyone says this and that about Riise, and I'm like, 'F****** hell, he didn't do anything wrong!' It wasn't a bad tackle. It was just unfortunate. You block it, you land, it goes underneath you, whatever it is.\"",
      "Despite suffering such a serious injury, Smith still plays football recreationally and coaches in the United States. He has also remained active through other sporting pursuits.",
      "\"Yeah the body's fine, because I don't really try and do anything to make it bad,\" he revealed when questioned about his current physical state. \"Cycling, swimming... I think the key is to just try and keep doing something.",
      "\"It's trying to find that balance of doing something that doesn't make my ankle really bad so I'm struggling to walk, but doing enough to get movement in it. So it's doing okay.",
      "\"It's just not stressing it too much because it's the inflammation then obviously the next day. I've been doing red light therapy on my ankle quite a bit and that's been helping it because it takes the inflammation down a lot. Just in the mornings when I'm getting going that I struggle with the ankle.\"",
      "Discussing the permanent metalwork in his ankle, he explained: \"Yeah, I've got them in my left side. My left side I've got the screws in. The same screws from the operation!",
      "\"Some people take them out, but I always remember when I went to United, Quinton Fortune had them in his knee, and then Quinnie got advice that he should take them out, and I always remember he took them out, and then a few months later, he did his knee again.",
      "\"So I've always thought I'd rather leave him in and be on safe side than try and take him out and then, God forbid, all that happens.\"",

The Manchester United loannee was absent for their La Liga win over Athletic Club this past weekend because of illness with that also playing a part in Flick's decision.",
      "Even without Rashford, Barca strode to victory back at the Camp Nou for the first time in a few years by scoring four goals while also keeping a clean sheet.",
      "Torres grabbed a brace in that game and Flick therefore rewarded him for that by naming him in the starting XI for their trip to Stamford Bridge",
      "Flick, as quoted by Mundo Deportivo, said: \"Ferran scored two goals on Saturday, and Marcus had been out for three or four days due to his injury, but he’s ready to play at any moment.\"",
      "That latter phrase was confirmed by Flick at half-time with Rashford coming on for Torres, who had missed a great opportunity in the first half, before things unravelled for his side. A Jules Kounde own goal and Ronald Araujo red card saw Barcelona a man and goal down at the interval.",
      "Rashford struggled to get into the game with Chelsea able to extend their lead through a dazzling Estevao Willian strike and clinical Liam Delap finish.",
      "The 28-year-old is unlikely to be judged for his display in west London given the challenging circumstances with Flick a big fan of Rashford as he made perfectly clear when asked about his return to the fold.",
      "He said: \"I'm really very happy [he is back]. We will decide tomorrow [Tuesday] if he plays from the beginning or if he comes in from the bench. But as I said, I'm happy to have him in our team.",
      "\"Last time when we played Newcastle, I also said this. I have followed him, I think, his whole career. I was impressed about him, with his quality, what he is doing in the box, what he is doing in front of goal.",
      "\"He has also showed it in Barcelona, which is really good. But for him, this change to live in another culture. The people in Barcelona are fantastic, we have nice weather. For me, it's amazing.",
      "\"You can see now he is also smiling a lot, and if he can enjoy the atmosphere we have, it is also good for him.\"",
      "The decision to sign him permanently from United is unlikely to be made by Flick but 13 goal contributions this season shows he is putting himself in a great position to have the £26million buy-option in his loan switch activated.",
      "Ruben Amorim could certainly do with Rashford at the moment after his side failed to score against 10-man Everton on Monday evening.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko missed the game through injury with the latter set to miss the next few weeks. Bryan Mbeumo will also be absent for a period across the New Year as he competes in AFCON for Cameroon.",

      "Although Casemiro has become an influential figure again this season he looked like a 33-year-old and was passive. It wasn't a surprise to see him substituted in the 58th minute. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His passing was sloppy at times and he resorted to shooting from distance in an effort to get United back into the contest. Wasted a big chance from close range with 20 minutes remaining. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Looks low on confidence and was poor again at Old Trafford. He missed a decent chance in the first half - his end product must improve - and is likely to be replaced by Dalot at the weekend. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "The international break had the potential to disrupt Mbeumo's momentum. The 26-year-old showed determination on a night when United weren't at the races for large parts. 5",
      "Amad",
      "Was probably the pick of a bad bunch in the first half. Amad relocated to right wing-back when Mazraoui was brought off and he was still involved in most attacking phases of play. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "The highlight of Zirkzee's first half was his heated exchange with James Tarkowski. The Dutchman made his first start of the campaign and didn't do much until drawing a late save from Pickford. 4",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made a difference when he came on. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "An improvement on Dorgu. 5",

      "Ruben Amorim disagreed with the decision to send off Everton midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye against Manchester United and said that he wants his players to \"fight each other\".",
      "Gueye was sent off for slapping teammate Michael Keane in the 13th minute of the game. The Premier League said on the decision: \"The referee’s call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.\"",
      "Despite playing most of the contest with 10 men, Everton were able to secure three points thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's strike in the first half. Amorim was asked whether he was embarrassed about the result, and responded: \"It was also 11 v 11, the first moments you can feel it.\"",
      "He explained that he disagreed with the sending off, saying: \"Fighting is not a bad thing, it doesn’t mean they don’t like each other. I don’t agree with that sending off, we can fight with teammates.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other. They cannot be a sending off, but my players show many games that we can do it. Today we didn’t manage to do it.\"",
      "Amorim added on the display: \"When you have more players with different characteristics, you have more options to score goals, especially against low blocks.",
      "\"We could lose the game, but with a different intensity. The other team fight each other and we didn’t understand the moments of the game and that is my fault, I need to explain every moment.\"",
      "\"If nothing happened, I don't think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised,\" said Moyes. \"I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it.",
      "\"I got told that the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble. But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we got the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our teammates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim waved his arms and screamed as Manchester United attempted to win the ball back from Everton. Amorim insisted after each win in October there was plenty more work to do and he was right.",
      "Everton had won just once at United in the Premier League in the past 32 years, a 1-0 triumph in 2013 under Roberto Martinez when David Moyes was managing in the home dugout.",
      "Moyes had not won at Old Trafford in 17 attempts as a visiting manager, so history was stacked against Everton, but he oversaw an unlikely victory with just 10 men on the pitch.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both were enforced, with Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha dropping out of the squad due to injury, opening the door for Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to start.",
      "The tactical battle was an interesting one in the opening exchanges. Everton played a high line and pressed with purpose. They wanted Senne Lammens to kick the ball long because they have the height to win aerial balls.",
      "James Tarkowski pushed Zirkzee to the floor in an off-the-ball incident. Zirkzee came close to squaring up with the defender, but referee Tony Harrington gave both a warning.",
      "There must have been something in the air because tensions then boiled over between Everton players. Idrissa Gana Gueye was unhappy with Michael Keane, and he slapped his own teammate in a moment of madness. Gueye was shown a red card and was red in the face as Jordan Pickford held him back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes stood yards away from the incident and couldn't believe what he was watching. The Everton analysts who were sitting in the press box looked equally dumbfounded.",
      "United had kept just one clean sheet in the league, which came against Sunderland, before the visit of Everton, but the sending off handed a huge opportunity to record another.",
      "That's without mentioning that Everton's strikers can't score for toffee. Thierno Barry was goalless in 11 league appearances but was given the nod to start, which meant Beto (one goal in 11) was on the bench. However, Iliman Ndiaye looked threatening at times and Jack Grealish was involved on the left.",
      "United started so badly that Gueye's sending off didn't stop Everton from being on the front foot. The travelling Evertonians chirped and erupted when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring.",
      "\"Hit it,\" shouted the Everton analyst. Leny Yoro didn't commit to the challenge and Lammens should have done better. The goalkeeper's starting position was poor and the shot was saveable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez returned to the squad after recovering from their respective injuries, although the latter's return was more significant given the length of his lay-off.",
      "Martinez had been sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury. It was great to see him back in the squad and he received a warm reception when he emerged to warm up.",
      "There was further applause for youngster Shea Lacey, who was named in a senior squad for the first time, reward for delivering consistently strong performances in academy fixtures. Lacey has a high ceiling and his squad inclusion is expected to be the first of many.",
      "Mani from The Stone Roses sadly passed away this month. United played \"I Want To Be Adored\" as kick-off approached, and \"This Is The One\" carried more meaning as the players walked out.",
      "The first half performance was reminiscent of last season. United must brush teams like Everton aside at home if they want to secure Champions League qualification next season. November started with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, but Everton was a much bigger setback.",
      "Most of those in red shirts looked disinterested in the first half, and Amorim hooked Noussair Mazraoui at the interval. Mason Mount was introduced and Amad relocated to right wing-back.",
      "Patrick Dorgu had another game to forget and was hauled off before the hour mark. The problem is his replacement, Diogo Dalot, has also been unconvincing from the left this season. The huge cheer for Mainoo as he replaced Casemiro showed what fans think about the handling of him.",
      "Amorim was widely praised after an excellent October, but United have not entered the winter as they would have liked. The games come thick and fast, and they must find another response.",
      "There were joyous scenes in the Everton section at the full-time whistle. Yoro slumped to his knees and Fernandes complained. The United captain should look at himself first after such a poor display.",
      "Moyes claimed an away win at Old Trafford on his 18th attempt. He'll argue it was worth the wait.",

      "Big Sam has managed over a thousand games in his career and will come back for one more in a special Mirror Sport competition.",
      "The former Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham, Sunderland and Everton boss will oversee selection, tactics and deliver the pre-match, half-time and full-time talks for one lucky amateur team.",
      "Allardyce is one of the football personalities backing a Sky Bet and British Heart Foundation (BHF) initiative to raise awareness of life-saving CPR amongst everyone in grassroots football",
      "It is part of the pioneering Every Minute Matters campaign – a unique partnership between Sky Bet and BHF and supported by the English Football League - which has already successfully inspired over 350,000 people to start learning CPR since the campaign launched in May 2024.",
      "To have a chance of signing Big Sam for the day, simply send your name, contact details, the name of your team and your league, in the form below. If you can't see the form,  click here.",
      "The winner will be drawn on December 1 and Sam will take charge of a game between January 1 and April 30, 2026.",
      "All entrants need to be part of an adult over 18s men’s or women’s 11-a-side team. Teams from walking football can enter.",
      "Allardyce was inspired to help the Every Minute Matters campaign by the shocking experience suffered by Fabrice Muamba, whose heart stopped beating for a total of 78 minutes after he suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup match at White Hart Lane in 2012.",
      "Allardyce explains: “I can still vividly remember what happened to Fabrice a couple of years after I left Bolton. Thanks to immediate CPR and defibrillation, Fabrice made a full recovery. But most grassroots football teams don’t have a medical team on site, which is why it’s critical anyone who plays amateur football – at any level – knows how to perform CPR and use a defibrillator.",
      "“Too many people still think you have to be a medical professional to step in, but that’s simply not true. Anyone can learn these lifesaving skills and if someone collapses, you need to have the confidence to act. “And that confidence comes from training. That’s why I’m urging everyone in grassroots football to take 15 minutes to learn CPR and defibrillation with the BHF’s brilliant free online tool, RevivR.”",
      "This competition closes at 12pm on the 1st of December 2025."

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have revealed how they were once consulted over some potential transfer arrivals to the club in a secret meeting.",
      "The pair claim it happened during a spell when Ryan Giggs was named as the interim manager, which occurred during the 2013/14 season following the dismissal of David Moyes.",
      "At the time, Manchester United were looking to rebuild following the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era, with plenty of big-name transfers following in an attempt to get the side back in the Premier League title picture.",
      "With that in mind, the executive vice-chairman at the time, Ed Woodward, sought out some help from Scholes and Butt to discuss transfer targets, with a four-man shortlist proposed to the pair.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the United legends were asked about how that meeting with Woodward led to Paul Pogba's return.",
      "Butt responded and said: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season... then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well.",
      "\"And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was 'go for both of them, Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United went on to re-sign Pogba in August 2016, in a deal from Juventus that could have reached up to £93m with all of the add-ons included.",
      "The French midfielder went on to make 233 appearances for the club, scoring 39 goals and assisting 51 times for his teammates, before leaving in 2022 on a free transfer.",
      "Pogba's career is often reflected on in different ways, with many remembering the magic he could conjure up, while others believe he never found it consistently enough to match the large fee paid for him.",
      "Perhaps the addition of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas alongside him could've changed those fortunes, with the former pair impressing at Real Madrid for many more years to come, while the latter had a spell back in England with Chelsea, before featuring in France and then Italy.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "“Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford’s a big pitch. It’s a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "“I’d say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don’t like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "“He’s come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I’d like to see all three of them.",
      "“I’d probably say I’d go Wharton. I still don’t think they’re any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they’re more the style of football these days.",

      "“One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team.",

      "“But the manager’s just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that’s something he has to deal with.",
      "“I think he’s dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "“As I’m frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don’t have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "“He [Amorim] possibly doesn’t trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn’t the most physical, but he’s streetwise. He knows the position, he’s done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he’s got that experience.",
      "“Kobbie hasn’t quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he’s going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don’t do that.",
      "“They’ve got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he’s got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage past at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 16th despite a ropey set of results on matchday five, while all three of England’s Thursday night warriors also look set for play-off rounds at worst.",
      "Total points: 97.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",

      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently looking over their shoulders in 20th and 22nd.",

      "Only having five teams but a couple of them being very decent means Portugal are prone to starting deceptively well here, with any wins your Sportings and Portos pick up being worth a chunky 0.4pts apiece.

      "It has been well-documented that Man Utd are on the hunt for a new midfielder in 2026. With Ruben Amorim’s side aiming to finish in the Premier League top four this season, signing a new player for the middle of the park is the utmost priority for the Red Devils.",

And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",

Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season.

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires.

      "Vinicius Junior has informed Real Madrid president Florentino Perez that he is not of a mind to extend his Real Madrid contract beyond 2027 owing to his fraught relationship with manager Xabi Alonso.",
      "After shaking his head in disgust and muttering “always me, I’m leaving the team” after being substituted in the 72nd minute of El Clasico last month, his exit may in fact come sooner than that, with The Athletic revealing that tensions between Vinicius and Alonso ‘have only grown’ as the season’s gone on – ‘it is a topic of daily debate inside and outside the club.’",
      "The question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be The Man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case.",
      "The smart money would be on the mad money coming from Saudi Arabia, but what about his Premier League options? We’ve ranked the Big Six on their chance of signing him.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham",
      "Oh to be a fly on the dressing room wall as Thomas Frank explains to Vinicius the importance of timing his runs to get on the end of long ball flick-ons that Richarlison never wins.",
      "“Can’t we play through the lines, gaffer?” Vinicius says, to suppressed chuckles from the Spurs masses.",
      "“No, but look at our stadium,” Frank replies.",
      "",
      "5) Chelsea",
      "A Brazilian front three at Stamford Bridge would be fun, but spending big on ready-made stars isn’t part of a Chelsea plan based largely upon resale value and the key difference between Vinicius, Joao Pedro and Estevao is the Blues pair’s outstanding work off the ball as well as on it.",
      "There’s also a very good and highly amusing possibility that the Blues hierarchy may deem Vinicius a bit too old for them. At 25 he would be the fifth-oldest player in the squad.",
      "Would be well worth it purely to see Vinicius’ reaction to teammate and compatriot Estevao winning the Ballon d’Or ahead of him.",
      "MAILBOX: Estevao touted as new Neymar as Maresca hailed for keeping him on a leash",

      "4) Manchester City",
      "“Vinicius is… wow,” was a Pep Guardiola press conference snippet that’s predictably been cited as evidence of the Manchester City manager’s interest in signing the Brazilian by some outlets.",
      "But it was midway through an answer on the excellence of Jeremy Doku and how “incredible” Liverpool right-back Conor Bradley endured a nightmare against him in the recent 3-0 City win over the Reds having coped very comfortably indeed with the problems posed by Vinicius a few days.",
      "Guardiola did say in that same press conference that Doku “will never be a top, top scorer” and City could really do with some goals from their forwards beyond Erling Haaland’s contribution that Vinicius would provide. It could happen under Guardiola, but strikes us as a far more post-Pep panic move from a state-owned football club looking to sell shirts as they suffer a legacy boss comedown.",
      "",
      "3) Liverpool",
      "It would very New Liverpool for Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards to look at their alarming issues in defence, their stunning dip in midfield dynamism and the general lack of cohesion in a squad on the back of signing £420m-worth of big-name talent and think the best fix to be signing a famously stroppy, high-maintenance winger to play on the left over someone to play on the opposite side to replace their in-situ stroppy, high-maintenance winger.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United",
      "Any teenager would think it mad that Vinicius Junior would even consider a move to Manchester United. Most of them won’t remember the last time they won the Premier League title in 2012 and will be relying on tales of their exasperating greatness from parents, grandparents or millennial friends and family in order to fathom why members of an Amazonic tribe are still wearing Nike AIG Cristiano Ronaldo No. 7 shirts.",
      "Vinicius would have just turned eight when Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez were leading the line for United in the 2008 Champions League final win over Chelsea. They weren’t just one of the biggest teams in world football then, they were actually one of the best. Chances are they would have been somewhere near the top of a Vini Jr dream football club list.",
      "Amid reports that a sponsor will ‘cover the cost’ of his transfer for Manchester United the immediate thought is that INEOS are doing things a bit differently to their predecessors. No whopping contracts for quick-fix superstars. Not buying British but buying British based at least; achieving some success in doing so with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But we must never discount the nagging Manchester United need to occasionally prove to the world that they are indeed Manchester United and can still attract the very biggest names in football, even when they’re not what they need in any way and are actually quite likely to undo the slight and evidently brittle improvements they’ve made under Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1) Arsenal",
      "It doesn’t reflect at all well on Vinicius that a team as impeccably well-drilled and brilliant as Arsenal has to be able to cope with having him in the team. While the quality he would provide in attack may not be enough to offset his lack of contribution in defence for others in the Premier League, Mikel Arteta’s side may just be at a stage in his ‘process’ where they can afford a defensive passenger who can make such a difference in the final third. They’re ready to ‘break the bank’ as ‘favourites’ to sign him.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori has looked very comfortable on that left side of defence for Arsenal and Declan Rice can always shift across and defend when necessary as an all-round midfield master.",
      "Leandro Trossard was given his dues in the form of people who haven’t given him his dues saying others haven’t given him his dues after his excellent performance against Tottenham, but let’s be absolutely clear, Arsenal are still very much in the market for a new left winger.",
      "And with eyes on the Champions League either on top of the Premier League in 2026 or after it in 2027, it would be useful to have a guy who’s won it twice and scored in both of those finals.",
      "Manchester City are using their women’s stadium to power an academy which has already developed Foden, O’Reilly and Lewis, with sustainability at the core.",
      "Liverpool ‘could ask’ Jurgen Klopp to make a ‘dramatic return’ soon and sort out this Arne Slot mess after the German’s ’emphatic response’ to a slump.",
      "Arne Slot needs to try something different to help a Liverpool side clearly missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. But grief apparently cannot be used as an excuse.",
      "Is the title race over before the Christmas decorations go up if Arsenal win at Chelsea? And what next for Liverpool and Spurs? It’s a Big Weekend, all right.",
      "According to reports, Vinicius Junior has made a decision on whether to extend his contract at Real Madrid amid interest from several Premier League sides.",

      "He added: “He is a massive talent. Does he always make a difference? Maybe not, but he hasn’t been given the time and you are only as good as the people you are surrounded by. I definitely worry about his future.”",

      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping tabs on a former Red Devil for a shock return from a Premier League rival on a free transfer.",
      "United are doing better than they did last season. Indeed, they finished 15th in the Premier League, beating the eighth-placed finish the season prior for their worst in the competition.",
      "They have flirted with the top four this term – they’re currently 10th in the league but only three points off fourth-placed Aston Villa.",
      "While there’s been much-needed progress under Ruben Amorim, there are still some shortfalls. Casemiro’s resurgence in the midfield has been welcome, though he’s still not the most consistent performer, and he’s playing alongside Bruno Fernandes, who should be playing further up the field.",
      "Beyond that pair, Amorim does not seem massively fond of Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo and could instead sign James Garner.",
      "Links with a number of star Premier League midfielders have surfaced in recent months, with it known that’s the area they’re likely to prioritise next.",
      "But the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are unlikely in January as they’ll cost huge sums, and each will have a lot of interest in the summer.",
      "The links with Garner, as per talkSPORT, could mean for a welcome transfer for no fee at all. Garner is out of contract at Everton at the end of the season and Everton are said to be stepping up contract talks.",
      "But United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are all said to be keeping tabs on the situation, in case a renewal does not come to fruition.",
      "Should United land Garner, he’d be returning to the club he played his academy football for – where he was a star, but then played just seven times in the first team before being sold to Everton for just £15million.",
      "If United are able to bring him back on a free, they’d not have the embarrassment of paying a huge sum for a former academy player they let go, as was the case with Paul Pogba.",
      "Garner showed the Red Devils first hand his effectiveness as Everton beat them 1-0 on Monday night – the midfielder assisted the only goal of the game, while he also made three interceptions and one clearance, per SofaScore.",
      "United could certainly do worse than bringing the 24-year-old back, particularly if it’s for no fee.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £400m and have ended up with a Like A New Signing upstaging them all, while Carabao chances were taken at Brighton and Chelsea."

      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "Much of Amorim’s first summer in charge at Old Trafford was spent trying to shift players he did not want or saw no future for. It will be a similar story next year if United are serious about a rebuild.",
      "As Amorim marks a year since his first game, here are five players who ought not to be around in 12 months…",
      "",
      "It has been a rough week for Shaw, who bore the brunt of Gary Neville’s frustration on Monday night.",
      "Neville, irked by United’s lack of intensity while chasing the game against Everton, might have been venting but he wasn’t wrong. Shaw was ‘ambling’.",
      "It is an apt description of the former England defender who seem to have become more and more one-paced since entering his 30s. His defending can be passive and though he doesn’t get the same opportunities to bomb on as part of a back three as he might as a wing-back or full-back, you would have to question if Shaw is still capable of that.",
      "At least he is available. He has started all 12 games, compared to just 16 starts over the previous two seasons. Only once in the last four seasons has he started more than half of United’s Premier League games.",
      "Next summer, Shaw will have turned 31 and be entering the final year of a contract that makes him joint fifth among United’s highest earners. Those numbers don’t add up when it comes to INEOSonomics. They already decided the last one was a mistake in 2023.",
      "",
      "We have all held our hands up and admitted we were wrong to write off Casemiro. Some did so more forcefully, disrespectfully than others. This season, the Brazilian has once more become one of United’s most important players.",
      "It is safe to assume, though, that there is little longevity in that status. He will be 34 in February and in the last four months of his massive contract at Old Trafford.",
      "If INEOS were p*ssed about Shaw’s contract, Casemiro’s terms left Sir Jim Ratcliffe apoplectic. The Brazilian is the highest earner at the club, on a salary it is hard to envisage United ever offering again on Ratcliffe’s watch.",
      "More to the point, United desperately need a top-class central midfielder, maybe two. If Casemiro is still the first-choice no.6 next season, we know something has gone terribly wrong with their recruitment.",
      "",
      "Speaking of terrible recruitment…",
      "Ugarte, unfortunately, is damned by Scott McTominay’s stunning success at Napoli. United sold the Ballon d’Or nominee and put that money towards the £50million sent PSG’s way – presumably, much to their astonishment – in an effort to replace Casemiro.",
      "It is perhaps an unfair comparison, but hard to ignore given the trajectories of the two midfielders. McTominay has made himself one of Europe’s most wanted; Ugarte can’t get a game for a team in dire need of his supposed profile.",
      "It takes time to adapt to the Premier League, but it’s been almost a season and a half now. This was the season he needed to step up. And Ugarte looks further away than he ever did.",
      "Having worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, it was thought that Ugarte would be one of the main beneficiaries of the manager’s appointment. But Amorim has been left stunned at the difference in player he bossed at Sporting Lisbon compared to the one who sits on his bench. “He is struggling in the moment,” said Amorim. “He needs to improve, especially in training.” That last part is damning indeed.",
      "Alarm bells were ringing immediately after United signed Zirkzee when no one could really identify what he was. When the question was put to the man himself he admitted that he was neither a no.9 nor a no.10. “I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5.”",
      "It is bad enough when United sign players for positions that are not a priority, but signing a player in a position that does not actually exist was a new low.",
      "So it can come as no surprise that Zirkzee has struggled to adapt. A year after his arrival, United felt it necessary to buy a whole new strikeforce, which left the Netherlands forward in no doubt over his prospects.",
      "Injuries to Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha gave Zirkzee an opportunity to lead Amorim’s line against Everton. “He did alright,” said Amorim, damning the 24-year-old with the faintest of praise. It is not an opportunity he is likely to get again any time soon, assuming Cunha is back for the trip to Palace on Sunday.",
      "",
      "All we’re prepared to commit to here is that if United are to persist with wing-backs, they need a new one for the left flank.",
      "Neville effectively wrote off the entire left side as an attacking threat against Everton, and he wasn’t wrong. Which makes the looming AFCON all the more worrying for United since they will lose Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo, the two players that make their right side so much more potent.",
      "On the opposite side, Amorim seems to favour Dorgu but it’s a close-run thing since neither the Dane nor Dalot have been able to pin down the role as their own.",
      "That’s maybe more understandable in Dalot’s case since he is right-sided. Even if he starts high and wide – not his natural habitat – he is only ever going to drive inside into traffic. Dalot’s versatility has come in useful for numerous managers now since Jose Mourinho signed him while telling the world the Portuguese could be United’s right-back for 10 years. Almost eight years later, he’s not that.",
      "Dorgu, 21, is still a relative rookie having joined United from Parma less than a year ago. But in that time, in 32 appearances, he has as many red cards as assists (one) and no goals.",
      "Beyond the numbers, it is hard to recall any contribution of note. Just a run, a cross, a shot. Anyone?",
      "Dorgu seemed a strange signing given he was a relative rookie and the importance of wing-backs in Amorim’s system. Already, they need another.",
      "Manchester City are using their women’s stadium to power an academy which has already developed Foden, O’Reilly and Lewis, with sustainability at the core.",
      "Liverpool ‘could ask’ Jurgen Klopp to make a ‘dramatic return’ soon and sort out this Arne Slot mess after the German’s ’emphatic response’ to a slump.",
      "Arne Slot needs to try something different to help a Liverpool side clearly missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. But grief apparently cannot be used as an excuse.",
      "Is the title race over before the Christmas decorations go up if Arsenal win at Chelsea? And what next for Liverpool and Spurs? It’s a Big Weekend, all right.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of four defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having an elite No.6.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the recent record of Arne Slot at Liverpool “reads like” Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as he wants to see the Reds boss “rinsed” like Amorim was.",
      "The Reds have had a very poor last couple of months. They went on a four-game Premier League losing streak, as well as losing to Galatasaray in the Champions League and being dumped out of the League Cup by Crystal Palace.",
      "After picking up their sixth Premier League win of the season, they’ve since lost twice more. After faltering at the back end of last season – when they’d already won the league – their record in the last 30 games is not great.",
      "Discussing Liverpool’s shortfalls on his YouTube channel, Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand suggested Slot should be under the same scrutiny that United boss Amorim was when he arrived and began in poor form.",
      "Ferdinand said: “You look at these stats. Since the Paris Saint-Germain loss in March – that’s 30 games – 13 wins, 14 defeats. This reads like Amorim. This reads like Amorim when he was struggling. Win rate of 43 per cent.",
      "“They had Amorim straight away, getting rinsed, under pressure when he wasn’t winning a few games. I’d like to see the same energy for Arne Slot right now, please.",
      "“It’s the worst start they’ve had to a season since Brendan Rodgers was sacked, by the way.”",
      "It is not as if Slot is not facing scrutiny at the moment. His side won the league last term and are currently 12th in the division and 11 points short of leaders Arsenal.",
      "Fans and media alike of course feel the Dutchman should have his squad in a better place. However, having won the league last term, he has credit in the bank, which was also aided by the fact he led them to five wins on the spin to start the season.",
      "MORE ON LIVERPOOL FROM F365:\n👉 Big Midweek: Arsenal v Bayern, Mo Salah, Thomas Frank, Chelsea, Championship title clash\n👉 Liverpool cheer up depressed fans with rare Adidas move\n👉 Liverpool ‘in pole position’ to sign Guehi in January on one condition as Semenyo ‘clause breached’",
      "If the poor run continues – after back-to-back 3-0 losses against Manchester City and then Nottingham Forest – then Slot may not only be under scrutiny but face the sack.",
      "A Champions League game against PSV Eindhoven should not be the sternest task, and the Reds then face 17th-placed West Ham in the Premier League, giving them a couple of chances at getting back into form.",
      "Should the result of those games not be positive, things will not look great for Slot.",
      "Liverpool ‘could ask’ Jurgen Klopp to make a ‘dramatic return’ soon and sort out this Arne Slot mess after the German’s ’emphatic response’ to a slump.",
      "Troy Deeney feels Arne Slot cannot do what he wants with Mohamed Salah as he’s already proven his toys will be “out the pram” and he’s refusing to “take accountability” ...",
      "A Dutch journalist has suggested Liverpool have ‘every reason’ to get rid of Arne Slot as the Reds boss is beginning to sound ‘desperate.’",
      "Arne Slot needs to try something different to help a Liverpool side clearly missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. But grief apparently cannot be used as an excuse.",
      "Scholes has made his midfield ‘pick’ from three possible Man Utd signings and hit out at Ruben Amorim for the “most disappointing thing” he has done.",
      "We have predicted the next six exits from Liverpool, with Arne Slot and Mohamed Salah among the doomed Reds sextet primed to leave in the coming months…"

      "Ruben Amorim dismisses direct comparisons between his Man Utd and Crystal Palace ahead of Sunday's trip to Selhurst Park because, he says, 'we play in a different way' despite shaping up in same 3-4-2-1 formation but he admits Oliver Glasner's side 'are doing things better than us'",
      "Friday 28 November 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",
      "The United boss came under fire for refusing to adapt in Monday's dismal defeat to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, bringing his 3-4-2-1 formation back into the spotlight ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who have enjoyed success playing in the same shape.",
      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",
      "Asked if wing-back is an area he wants to strengthen, Amorim said: \"We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I've said that over the last year.",
      "\"To give an example, in the last game [against Everton], we should have an Amad with the right foot to put on the other side to play against 10 men.",
      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",
      "\"We play in a different way. You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Palace possess a top wing-back in Daniel Munoz, and the Colombia international has previously spoken of his desire to play for Manchester United.",
      "Speaking earlier this month to AS, he said: \"I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another. For me, it would be a dream to play for one of those clubs, whether it's Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that; every day I give it my all so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of these clubs.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. I'm not really aware of what's being said; I don't have any information about whether these teams want me or are interested in me.",
      "\"We'll see when the winter transfer window approaches.\"",
      "Glasner defended Amorim's system ahead of the game and said he had seen an improvement in United this season.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front. Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Amorim admits he would have preferred to bring on a more attacking alternative to Dalot at Everton with no other options available on his bench, but stuck with the same shape nonetheless.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Friday 28 November 2025 08:06, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have."

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "Friday 28 November 2025 18:45, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees Newcastle slipping up on the road again at Everton.",
      "To have picked up 13 points from a possible 18 at home despite facing a tough fixture list of Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Aston Villa is an excellent barometer of the work Keith Andrews is doing at Brentford. There's been no ripping up of the tactical blueprint. No reinventing of any wheels. Just smart coaching and decision making that is utilising their strengths.",
      "Meanwhile, there's good intent, plenty of promise, lots of neat build-up at Burnley, but when the big moments come, the Clarets too often are brushed aside. Over 2.5 goals has landed in every one of their six away days so adding that line to a Brentford win results in a 5/4 shot to attack with Sky Bet.",
      "When a price looks wrong, it's usually because the market has failed to adapt to a change in circumstances. And in Rayan Cherki's case, the assumption is that the Premier League will treat him the same way Ligue 1 did when it comes to being fouled.",
      "The algorithms that price the \"fouls won\" markets are still feeding on French data, where he averaged 1.4 last season - it's a figure that is on the rise. He's been fouled two or more times in three of his four starts for City, where he is picking up the ball in the heart of the midfield battle, to an average of 1.9 fouls per 90. The 7/4 with Sky Bet for him to be fouled twice again is a lovely chunk of value.",
      "Sometimes the numbers don't whisper, they scream at you - and Bournemouth's away data is doing a full-blown fire alarm routine when it comes to backing goals in this encounter.",
      "Let's start with the headline stat: 3.85 goals per game in the last 20 Bournemouth's away fixtures.",
      "That isn't a trend, that's a lifestyle choice from Andoni Iraola, whose philosophy of how to play the game mirrors that chunky goal return. And when 18 of those 20 games on the road have sailed over 2.5 goals, you can stop calling it variance and start calling it what it is: a profitable betting theory when the prices are right.",
      "You don't hit overs in 18 of 20 by accident. Jump on the over 2.5 at 10/11 with Sky Bet. It's the bet of the weekend.",
      "Newcastle are about as reliable away from home as a toddler walking past a puddle.",
      "Dating back to last season, Newcastle have no win in eight Premier League away games - their worst run since December 2021 - and across all competitions they have lost four on the spin away from home sweet St James' Park.",
      "The energy, the press, the sharpness, everything that has made Eddie Howe's team a Premier League force, all goes down a gear on their travels. They have looked leggy, stretched and noticeably flatter in defeats at West Ham and Brentford of late.",
      "And, this game is of course their third game in eight days, too. Everton will be licking their lips.",
      "Newcastle away from home have a problem and Everton at home are a problem for them - just like Brentford and West Ham were - and the price hasn't quite caught up that fact. The 7/4 on offer from Sky Bet for a home win looks the smart play.",
      "Fulham to have 13 or more shots at 10/11 with Sky Bet has got my attention. Spurs are facing 12.7 shots per game this season. That's a marker of a team who are struggling to dominate territory and one which is happy to soak up pressure.",
      "And the teams clearing the 13-shot bar aren't exactly a who's who of juggernauts. Burnley, Bournemouth, Bodø/Glimt, Monaco and Leeds have all walked into Spurs matches and hit the magic 13 or more number.",
      "Also, Cristian Romero's suspension bodes well for a Fulham shots play.",
      "From a 23-game sample in the Premier League, Tottenham concede almost five more shots per match without their influential defender. A huge number. That's not a wobble, that's a structural collapse - one that Fulham can exploit on their way to a victory.",
      "Strip the names away, hide the crests and if this was Team A hosting Team B then Crystal Palace would be odds-on.",
      "Because every measurable facet of Palace's game carries more structure, coherence and repeatability than anything Manchester United are serving up right now. This is why the 13/10 on offer for a Palace home win is dripping in value.",
      "This isn't about history. It's about now. And right now, United play football that resembles a flickering lightbulb: occasionally bright but one bad moment away from plunging a room into darkness.",
      "Palace, under Oliver Glasner, are the opposite. They look like a team. A functioning one. A confident one. A side that knows how to create, how to control.",
      "You're getting a fantastic price here on a better-drilled side, the clearer identity, the team whose game has weight and repeatability, not a historical brand propped up by recreational money in the markets. Home win.",
      "The value doesn't live in the traditional markets here as Aston Villa are rightly dominating across the board - it's hiding where Wolves under Rob Edwards are on the improve and that's their set piece output. His teams work set plays meticulously.",
      "His Luton team ranked as the best team in the Championship from set piece goals scored and expected goals output in both spells in that league while his Forest Green side ranked second for expected goals from set pieces during their promotion from League Two.",
      "We've already seen signs in one game that Wolves are taking set pieces more seriously after creating 0.77 worth of expected goals from those scenarios in the defeat to Crystal Palace. Ladislav Krejci, who has had 10 shots in his last 10 games, was the main threat and first contact from corners last weekend. He looks a tasty bet at 12/1 with Sky Bet to score.",
      "If there's one thing betting teaches you, it's that bad beats are difficult to stomach no matter how long you've been in this game for. And last week's angle, Brentford on the double chance at Brighton - still lingers like a stubborn hangover. The logic was right, the bet looked to be cashing, right up until those football gods decided that Brentford would throw away a 1-0 lead with 10 minutes to go and Igor Thiago would miss a penalty with the final kick.",
      "But here we are again, staring at a very familiar setup. And, yes, I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct, who turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 34 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only two of 16 games otherwise. Forest played 26 per cent of passes long vs Liverpool last week and a similar approach puts them in a great spot of getting another result with the 10/11 on the draw no bet standing out.",
      "Virgil van Dijk has made nine fouls in his last five games. The imperious, sometimes untouchable defender has gone missing and been replaced by a far scruffier version that is making more mistakes and committing more fouls.",
      "It took 11 games for Van Dijk to reach five fouls at the start of last season - now it looks like he can make five in one game.",
      "That player who glided through matches without needing to lay a glove on anyone is suddenly hacking, grabbing and stepping into late challenges like a man trying to put out fires with a watering can. Playing next to Ibrahima Konate can do that to a player.",
      "His direct opponent Callum Wilson is clever at tempting defenders into awkward contact and picking up soft fouls. Go back two seasons ago and Wilson was drawing 1.6 fouls per 90 in the Premier League and has won five fouls in four starts under Nuno Espirito Santo, who seems to trust him now to be the focal point.",
      "The price of 11/2 with Sky Bet for Van Dijk to make at least two fouls is massive - best price of the season territory. Take the value before the market catches up.",
      "This game stinks of caution.",
      "Those anticipating that one of these teams are going to play \"statement-making football\" could end up disappointed as these games can turn into an exercise in risk management, especially when you consider the hectic schedule both teams are facing at the moment.",
      "Enzo Maresca and Mikel Arteta are cut from the same cloth when it comes to control and not taking unnecessary risks, especially Arteta in these types of games away from home. Last season, Arsenal won just once away in their eight games with top nine opposition, drawing five of those matches. They've been beaten at Anfield this season and came through in gritty fashion at Newcastle in a very nip-and-tuck encounter.",
      "Arteta plays these games like a draw is just fine in the grand scheme of things - and he's not wrong.",
      "Both teams know that a point keeps the narrative intact. Nothing is lost, everything remains possible. The stalemate, the bet no one wants to back, is the shrewdest way to approach the outright market with 21/10 on offer with Sky Bet."

      "\"I see the ideal Manchester United midfielder as being able to do everything.\"",
      "The words of former Old Trafford metronome, Paul Scholes.",
      "United's midfield remains a problem. Ruben Amorim's system continues to be drawn into question, a set-up with its frailties further scrutinised as a result of an insistence on leaving two players anchoring in the middle of the park.",
      "Whether it be personnel or instruction, United's inability to consistently control games continues to cost them.",
      "In a test of Amorim's system against 10-man Everton on Monday night, United had very few answers. Instead, Amorim's rare unbeaten run of five matches fell to a dismal end as United were outplayed, outfought and outthought.",
      "With 718 appearances for United, 155 goals and a trophy haul to rival most English football clubs, very few have taken to the Old Trafford midfield like Scholes once did.",
      "As he sat in central London, given an opportunity to mull over the past ahead of a live event for his podcast, The Good the Bad and The Football, being asked \"What makes a Manchester United midfielder?\", the proverbial gears began to turn.",
      "\"It's a little bit different when I played because you hear these number 6s, number 8s, number 10s, I suppose, come into that midfield role as well,\" Scholes says.",
      "\"You can attack, you can defend, you can be part of everything. That's your job as a midfield player for Manchester United.\"",
      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",
      "Kobbie Mainoo emerged as a key player for Erik ten Hag when he made his debut in 2023. That 'Everton debut' that fans reminisce about didn't see him deployed as a No 10, nor as a No 8. Instead, an 18-year-old Mainoo was United's deepest midfielder when he impressed.",
      "An England debut followed in the summer, where at the 2024 European Championship, England's performances improved when Mainoo started alongside Rice as a No 8 as the competition drew on.",
      "Mainoo started the Euro final for England but just two camps later, found himself hurled into the shadows as Rice's partner gained new suitors. Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",
      "\"I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",
      "One thing is for certain, though, United will continue the season, waiting for the midfielder that \"can do everything\".",

      "Despite United's poor recent form and a staunch critique of Amorim's formation, Glasner has pointed to the underlying numbers to defend the United boss.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front.",

      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a very good defensive structure with it.",

      "Asked if he is inspired by Glasner, Amorim added: \"I played against him in Frankfurt with Sporting, so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I take two weeks for an international break, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration I can.",

      "Man Utd were beaten 1-0 by Everton, who had 10 men for more than 75 minutes; Ruben Amorim said he is concerned about going back to the lows of last season; Amorim: \"We are nowhere near the moment we are meant to be. I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other.\"",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has claimed his side are \"nowhere near\" where they need to be and hopes they \"fight each other\" after losing to 10-man Everton.",
      "With Everton down to 10 men for over 75 minutes after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking his own team-mate Michael Keane, Amorim's side failed to break down a team who have only mustered one away win all season - against bottom side Wolves.",
      "It was the first time United have ever lost a home Premier League game after seeing the opposition pick up a red card, with United winning 36 of the 46 games in which it has happened before. It was also David Moyes' first ever win at Old Trafford as an opposition manager at the 18th attempt.",
      "But overall, it represents a new low for Amorim, who celebrated one year in charge of United in dismal fashion.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"We have a lot to do. We have to be perfect to win games, we were not perfect today.",
      "\"When we see the results of the weekend, we should get onto the pitch with a different excitement. Old Trafford was there saying 'we are all here for a big step up'. And we were not ready.",
      "\"These five weeks, everyone is praising our evolution. But I'm always saying the same things: we are nowhere near the moment we are meant to be in this club.\"",
      "Gueye's bizarre red card left Amorim wishing he had seen the same sort of fight from his own players.",
      "\"Fighting is not a bad thing,\" he added. \"Fighting doesn't mean you don't like each other. Fighting means you lose the ball and I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling.",
      "\"I don't agree with that red card. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct because the referee explained but I don't agree.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other - though they cannot get sent off! But that is a good feeling, not a bad feeling.\"",
      "Amorim also admitted he is concerned about returning to the feeling of last season - which ended in a 15th-place finish, no trophies and no European football for this season.",
      "\"I feel afraid of returning to this feeling of last season,\" said Amorim. \"That is my biggest concern. We need to work together. The players are trying but we need to be better.\"",
      "Gary Neville branded United's performance as an \"embarrassment\" at Old Trafford - while Jamie Carragher feels Amorim's credentials will be questioned on the basis of that performance.",
      "Amorim was criticised throughout the match for not moving away from his much-maligned 3-4-2-1 formation and continuing with five defenders on the pitch, despite having the player advantage.",
      "\"It was nowhere near good enough,\" said Neville on the Gary Neville Podcast. \"That was a really bad night for Man Utd, it was an embarrassment at times.",
      "\"Forget [injuries to Sesko and Cunha], there are no excuses. I'm not entertaining that one bit.",
      "\"Everton dominated them with 11 men and with 10 men, in a different way of domination, but they dominated them through their fight and their spirit.",
      "\"It's complacency, and complacency will kill you. The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency [from United]. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance. It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again.",
      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "Carragher added: \"This is a bad night for the manager. There was an awful long time left in that game [after 10-man Everton went ahead].",
      "\"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that when it's basically one guy up front who's not really up front, you don't need three players [at the back] there.",
      "\"It's one of those moments where I think a lot of people will really question the manager on the back of that defeat. They'll look at the players, and we know the players should do better, but the manager will take a lot of the blame for tonight.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era hit a new low as they lost 1-0 to an Everton side playing over 75 minutes with 10 men after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking team-mate Michael Keane.",
      "In extraordinary scenes at Old Trafford, Gueye got into an argument with centre-back Keane early in the first half and replays showed the midfielder raise his hands to the Everton defender's face. Gueye apologised to his team-mates at full-time.",
      "That moment should have allowed United to completely control of the game - if anything it did the opposite. Amorim's side looked like the team with 10 men - and Everton deservedly took the lead through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunner from distance.",
      "The midfielder's solo run got him to the edge of the box before he fired past Senne Lammens' outstretched gloves and into the net - with more questions falling to a United goalkeeper this season.",
      "United failed to take full advantage of their extra man in the first half, with their players booed off after their best chance was a Bruno Fernandes 30-yard strike which Jordan Pickford simply saved.",
      "United - missing Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury - started the second half in a similar vein. Half-time substitute Mason Mount put two chances wide, while Bryan Mbeumo saw an effort saved by Pickford.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" said Neville. \"They still don't win the first ball or second ball. Embarrassing.",
      "\"The subs have taken him down a cul-de-sac. There's no agility or flexibility firstly from the coach, but also the players.\"",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (4); Yoro (5), De Ligt (5), Shaw (3); Mazraoui (4), Casemiro (3), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (4); Amad (4), Zirkzee (3), Mbeumo (5)\n\n\nSubs:  Mount (4), Dalot (4), Mainoo (4)\n\n\nEverton: Pickford (9); Coleman (n/a), Tarkowski (8), Keane (8), Mykolenko (7); Gueye (1), Garner (7), Dewsbury-Hall (9); Ndiaye (8), Barry (8), Grealish (8) \n\n\nSubs:  O’Brien (7), Beto (n/a), Iroegbunam (n/a), McNel (n/a), Alcaraz (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall",
      "United almost found a way through when Joshua Zirkzee, starting his first United game for 225 days, forced Pickford into two wonder saves, before he then headed a Kobbie Mainoo cross wide.",
      "More boos rang out at full-time as former United coach David Moyes got his first win at Old Trafford as a visiting manager. For Amorim, this is a massive low.",
      "\"Frustration, disappointment with the way we played the game. They were the better team with 11 men. They defended really well with 10 men for 70 minutes. We deserved to lose. We didn't play well, with the right intensity.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions. We have a lot to do. We have to be perfect to win games, we were not perfect to win games.",
      "On the Everton red card: \"Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn't mean they don't like each other. Fighting is if you lose the ball, I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling with that red card.",
      "\"I don't agree with that sending off. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct, the referee explained it, I don't agree with that. I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other. I hope they don't get sent off, but that is a good feeling not a bad feeling.",
      "\"My players showed in many games we can do it. Today, we didn't. I need to help them. We need to be better in the future.\"",
      "\"It's complacency, and complacency will kill you. The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",

      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "\"If nothing happened, I don't think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised. I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it.",
      "\"I got told that the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.",
      "\"But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we get the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our team-mates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",
      "\"Rollercoaster game. I'll sleep well tonight, put it that way. So genuinely happy for the lads and how hard they worked. A fantastic performance of gritting away, getting a goal and keeping that spirit. So glad we got the three points.",
      "\"We started really well - the situation happened. It was a moment of madness, avoidable. But all I can say is Idrissa has apologised to us at full-time, said his piece and that's all he can do. We move on from it. The reaction from us, was unbelievable. Top tier. We could have crumbled but if anything, it made us grow.",
      "On what Moyes said at half-time: \"He just said: that's done now. We'll deal with that another time.",
      "\"It was about keeping to the plan we had. He made sure we do the right things, continue what we're dong, we can't change that now, in the second half we continued to do that.\"",
