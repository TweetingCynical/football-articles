      "Success in football can often hinge on a sliding doors moment, and it appears Liverpool's decision to appoint Arne Slot instead of Ruben Amorim was as crucial as any in their recent history. The pair's contrasting fortunes ever since coming to the Premier League couldn't be more opposite.",
      "After the shock announcement that Jurgen Klopp would leave Liverpool in January 2024, all eyes were on his successor. It's no secret that the hierarchy at the Reds were interested in then-Sporting CP head coach Ruben Amorim to take the reins at Anfield.",
      "Yet Liverpool opted for Feyenoord boss Slot, while United eventually moved for Amorim in November 2024 after sacking Erik ten Hag. There were several reasons why Liverpool chose the Dutchman over his Portuguese counterpart, with Amorim's rigid playing style said to be a major concern for Anfield officials.",
      "ESPN claimed that Amorim was snubbed, not only for his tactical inflexibility, but also due to the nearly £10million buy-out clause that Liverpool would have had to agree on in order to bring Amorim to Merseyside.",
      "Tensions over a perceived premature reporting of Liverpool's interest in Amorim also left the Anfield outfit irritated, according to The Athletic.",
      "Yet Liverpool’s hierarchy ultimately decided against Amorim as they felt his favoured 3-4-3 system would not suit the squad that Klopp had left behind, with the German often deploying a flat back four in a 4-3-3.",
      "Amorim's system – which can adjust into a 4-2-4 in transitions, a 5-2-3 when defending, and a 3-2-5 when attacking – was, and is, key to the manager’s ideals. However, Liverpool believed they didn't have the personnel to make a back three work, while Slot was already wedded to a back four thanks to his successful 4-2-4 approach in the Eredivisie.",
      "Bringing Amorim on board would have been a costly acquisition for the Reds, with a total overhaul of Liverpool's tried and tested formation required to realise Amorim's ambitions. The Athletic report also added that Liverpool had doubts about whether the 40-year-old's playing style would appeal to the Anfield crowd.",
      "Slot, meanwhile, has also claimed he was eventually the only one approached with the offer of the Liverpool job. That showed he was ultimately the first choice in the end, despite links to former Liverpool star Xabi Alonso too, who eventually left Bayer Leverkusen for Real Madrid this summer.",
      "United went ahead regardless of Liverpool's concerns and brought Amorim in, despite knowing the coaches' penchant for a back three.",
      "Fast forward to the 2025/2026 season, Slot is fast becoming an Anfield icon and Liverpool are the defending Premier League champions.",
      "Meanwhile, United are facing yet another crisis after the Red Devils were brutally dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by League Two side Grimsby Town on Wednesday night.",
      "Amorim's once growing stock, built on two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting in 2022 and 2024, appears to be at an all time low after he steered United to 15th in the Premier League last season and saw his side lose the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur in May.",
      "Having won just 16 games for United out of 45, his win rate lies at a paltry 35.6%. For comparison, his rate at Sporting was 71%, while the man sacked for Amorim – Ten Hag – had a success rate of 56% at United upon his dismissal.",
      "It's not like there hasn't been funds available to Amorim for him to carve United into his own image. Patrick Dorgu joined for £29m in January, while this summer saw Matheus Cunha sign in a £62.5m deal.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was recently brought in for £71m. Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko is the latest recruit, costing United £74m, while Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven were signed at the turn of the year for a total of around £5m and it's believed they aren't done yet in this current transfer window.",
      "It's mind boggling to think that Amorim has not even been in charge at Old Trafford for a year. However, a combination of his insistence on playing a back three and goalkeeping issues, with both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, have seen United ship 44 goals during his time in charge.",
      "His fallings out with senior players, such as Marcus Rashford, who has since joined Barcelona on loan, and Alejandro Garnacho have raised eyebrows and seen his position come under scrutiny.",
      "A discernible lack of improvement on the pitch, with former United stars such a Wayne Rooney questioning Amorim's constant in-game tinkering, has the Portuguese boss staring down the barrel just over nine months into his spell.",
      "Amorim is yet to taste victory this season too, with an opening day 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal coupled with an underwhelming 1-1 draw away to Fulham. Next up for United is a home match against Premier League new-boys Burnley on Saturday ahead of the international break. A short trip to Manchester City awaits after that.",
      "Liverpool, on the other hand, are heading into an early season title clash with Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday, with Slot's side having won two from two so far.",
      "Following their midweek humiliation to Grimsby, United will now be looking at the game against the Clarets as a must-win to keep their season afloat. A sliding doors moment indeed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Grimsby Town boss David Artell has heaped more embarrassment on Manchester United by insisting his side should not have needed penalties to win their Carabao Cup tie. Artell’s Mariners became the first fourth-tier side ever to beat United in a competitive match following a 2-2 draw at Blundell Park.",
      "The hosts deservedly led the tie at the break through goals from Charles Vernam and United youth product Tyrell Warren. Goalkeeper Andre Onana should have done better for the first goal and was embarrassed for the second before United fought back to level thanks to substitute Bryan Mbeumo’s strike and a late Harry Maguire header.",
      "Matheus Cunha wasted the chance to win the shootout after Onana had denied Clarke Oduor, with Mbeumo eventually sending his second effort off the crossbar in a 12-11 loss. At 1-0 and 2-0 up, Grimsby had goals disallowed, the first for handball and the second following a contentious offside call.",
      "“The disappointing thing, and I’m not trying to be… I don’t know what the word is, certainly not live on air! We should have won in 90 minutes, that’s the kicker for me. It shouldn’t have gone to the most ridiculous penalty shootout of my whole career. It shouldn’t have taken that to get over the line.”",
      "However, it didn’t take the gloss off one of the most significant results in the club’s history. Artell added: “It’s a magnificent night for the club and players. I hope it lives long in the memory.”",
      "Having gone so close to winning in normal time, Artell was asked what he said to his players before the shootout. He said: “I asked them, what is a penalty shootout? Just one question. A technical challenge, a psychological challenge, that’s it.",
      "“No tactics, no physical stuff. You’re going to feel nervous, you’re going to have butterflies, sweaty palms. That is absolutely normal, it’s a human thing, so don’t worry about that.",
      "“Then it’s a technical thing. Onana’s save from the one penalty we missed was an outstanding save. They backed themselves to be good technically, no pressure on them. There was no pressure on them before the game.",
      "“The only thing we could have lost was a bit of pride if we’d got whalloped by an unbelievably good team. Make no bones about it, they’ve got an unbelievably good team.”",
      "Grimsby’s reward is a third round trip to crisis club Sheffield Wednesday next month. For now, the Mariners’ focus returns to League Two and their home clash with Bristol Rovers on Saturday.",

      "Jadon Sancho has offered fans a glimpse into life as an exile at Manchester United as the end of the summer transfer window approaches. Sancho is still waiting for his future to be decided ahead of Monday’s deadline, having seen a succession of deals collapse.",
      "The 25-year-old winger has been in limbo this summer, having been placed in the ‘bomb squad’ by Ruben Amorim. The United manager told Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia that they had no future at the club before pre-season began.",
      "The group of outcasts have been forced to train by themselves, away from the first team group at Carrington, arriving after everyone else has left. And while Rashford has left for Barcelona, the rest of the outcasts remain at the club.",
      "Sancho has appeared close to leaving on a few occasions, with Fenerbahce, Juventus and Besiktas all showing an interest after Chelsea decided not to sign him permanently following his loan spell with them. Time is now running out, but Sancho doesn’t appear concerned about his future, judging by his social media output.",
      "On Wednesday he posted a selfie of himself, Malacia, Antony and Lisandro Martinez relaxing in the dressing room. Martinez is recovering from a long-term injury and appears to be one of the few United players who is allowed to interact with the bomb squad group.",
      "Interestingly, Garnacho is the only member of the group not pictured. The Argentina international is the subject of transfer interest from Chelsea, but, like the others, is yet to agree terms over an exit.",
      "Sancho has contributed just 12 goals and six assists in 83 matches for United since joining from Borussia Dortmund for £73million in 2021. He did better on loan with Chelsea, with five goals and 10 assists in 41 games last season, but their decision to pay £5m rather than sign him for £25m showed how far he has fallen.",
      "Sancho has turned down opportunities to join Fenerbahce and Besiktas because he does not want to move to Turkey at this stage of his career. He had come close to joining Juventus earlier in the summer, while there has been interest from Roma and Inter Milan, but nothing is close at this stage.",
      "Having spent over £200m on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, United need to offload some of their unwanted players before they can sign more stars in the transfer window. They want to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, but face the prospect of missing out on him to Galatasaray because they don’t currently have the funds available.",
      "Amorim had also wanted to sign a No.6 midfielder in this transfer window, but that prospect has not emerged, in part due to the inability to shift the members of his bomb squad.",

      "Andre Onana's outing in Manchester United's dismal defeat against Grimsby will have done little to reassure Ruben Amorim over his first choice goalkeeper. While there is already plenty of scrutiny on the Portuguese coach's position, the name of who is guarding his net could yet change first.",
      "After an error-strewn and uncertain start to the season for Altay Bayindir against Arsenal and Fulham, Onana returned to United's line-up for the trip to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. The former Inter star's future had already been a subject of conversation this summer with transfer links to the likes of Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martinez in recent months.",
      "Onana failed to crown himself in glory as United went two-nil down at Blundell Park before forcing penalties. The 29-year-old would have been disappointed to be beaten at his near post by Charles Vernam's effort and was caught floundering from a corner as Tyrell Warren was allowed to double the scoreline.",
      "Ahead of the game, Amorim was asked what was required of Onana. Many would suggest he failed to meet his coach's demands.",
      "\"He needs to do his job; it’s the same thing,\" said Amorim. \"I just expect the best from him, from my players. It doesn’t matter the context, if it’s a cup game or whatever. We just need to improve some things that went wrong against Fulham. He needs to improve his position, like always, so he’s ready for the game, and I expect the best from him.\"",
      "Amorim did not point the finger of blame at his goalkeeper following the match however. Instead he was critical of the whole team.",
      "“With all respect when you play against a fourth division team, it's not the goalkeeper, it's everything,” Amorim said. “It's the environment. It's the way we face the competition. Everything. With that performance today my players spoke for me really loud.”",
      "United transfer target Senne Lammens was left out of Royal Antwerp's squad for their clash with Mechelen, amid a prospective move to the Red Devils. Lammens would provide competition for Onana.",
      "Lammens looks set to sign for United in a £17.3million deal and could be quickly handed an opportunity following the club's start to the season. Though, Amorim has suggested any incoming deal is not reliant on an exit for one of his shotstoppers despite their unconvincing start.",

United were knocked out of the tournament on penalties by League Two side Grimsby. Grimsby went 2-0 up in the first half thanks to strikes from Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren, but late goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire sent the tie to penalties - only for Grimsby to emerge victorious 12-11.",
      "The humiliating defeat means United are still searching for their first win of the season and ramps up the pressure on manager Ruben Amorim. United have strengthened their squad this summer, forking out over £200million to bring in the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha. Yet, the Red Devils are still looking at adding more new signings and a midfielder is top of the list, having cooled their interest in Carlos Baleba with Brighton demanding more than £100m for the 21-year-old.",

      "United will be back in action on Saturday when they host Burnley at Old Trafford will be desperate to see a much improved performance from his side.",
      "\"In the end it doesn't matter if we recover or not,\" Amorim said after the loss to Grimsby. \"I know the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch. The best players lose because any players can win against any group of players. I think the players spoke really loud today. The best team won.",
      "\"I think it's really clear what they spoke. Let's move on from this day. I think it was really clear what happened today.\" When asked what went wrong, Amorim replied: \"I don't know. Not just the space but the way we start the game without any intensity, any idea of pressure.",

      "Manchester United outcast Antony has hinted he's holding firm in his hopes of leaving the club as talks continue with Real Betis. The Spanish outfit have left things late in their effort to execute a reunion with the winger, who was so instrumental in their success last season.",
      "United's third-most expensive player of all time moved to Old Trafford for an eye-watering £82million three years ago. However, according to reports, he could leave for less than half of that as Betis look to strike a deal, with the two clubs locked in discussions since Monday.",
      "It has been suggested Antony could re-join Manuel Pellegrini's squad in a second loan deal, with reports hinting it would cost them £3m this summer. That's before a proposed permanent deal for a further £33m in 2026.",
      "That is according to The Sun, while Antony's social media activity suggests he's holding out for a return to Spain. The Brazilian, who has in the past hinted he'd like to move back to Seville, uploaded a motivational image to his Instagram story. The post included the image of a lion along with some uplifting words, which appear to be a nod to the tribulations he has faced at United of late.",
      "\"Pain makes you stronger. Fear makes you braver. Patience makes you wiser,\" read the caption. That third comment in particular seems to suggest Antony is playing the long game in his bid to revive a career that tanked at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite commanding such an astronomical figure when he joined United, Antony failed to impress after recording just eight goal contributions in 62 Premier League appearances. Ruben Amorim agreed to send the player on loan to Betis in January 2025 as he enjoyed an immediate resurgence, matching his Premier League goal tally in just 17 La Liga appearances.",
      "He isn't the only player Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Red Devils are supposedly hoping to shift in the final days of the transfer window, with Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho both not in Amorim's plans.",
      "Betis boss Pellegrini has opened up about his desire to recruit Antony once again following his previous success in Seville. However, a permanent deal has been difficult to agree given Los Verdiblancos' financial constraints have made it a struggle to match United's valuations of the player.",
      "\"We all know how important Antony was here,\" said Pellegrini at a press conference earlier this week. \"Let's see if he can make it, hopefully.\"",
      "Antony's chances of salvaging any sort of future under Amorim declined this summer when he recruited Bryan Mbeumo as his new right winger. His revival in Spain succeeded in drumming up interest in a player whose stock looked low, though Betis appear to have been the only genuine contender interested in cutting a deal.",
      "United stand to lose £46m on their player if a deal amounting to £36m (£3m loan plus £33m permanent fee) can be agreed. However, the English giants would require some significant assurance Betis would make good on that obligatory investment in 2026.",
      "Fellow misfit Sancho spent last term on loan at Chelsea before the Blues opted to pay United an additional £5m just to get out of signing the player permanently. The Red Devils would like to avoid a repeat of that episode as they look to streamline their squad and recoup more cash following a summer of heavy investment.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has been slammed for acting like a \"child\" after blaming a minor collision with referee Chris Kavanagh for his penalty miss against Fulham on Sunday. The scathing criticism was delivered by former England winger Theo Walcott, who also cast doubt over Fernandes' suitability to continue as United's captain - BEFORE United's embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "The ex-Arsenal star's withering attack came after United were handed a spot-kick in their 1-1 draw with Marco Silva's side at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",
      "After a VAR check, referee Kavanagh awarded the penalty, but then inadvertently collided with Fernandes as the United skipper stepped back from positioning the ball on the penalty spot. The Portuguese midfielder subsequently confessed that the incident had \"upset\" him as it had disrupted his routine, which later saw him called out for his comments on the incident in the media.",
      "Fernandes appeared to challenge the official before repositioning the ball and blazing his effort over the crossbar. The 30-year-old was later spotted confronting Kavanagh as both teams returned for the second period, with Walcott believing Fernandes' behaviour has portrayed him as petulant.",
      "\"I look at it like this, it's a child's response,\" Walcott said on It's Called Soccer! \"Because you're still trying to teach their mind of how to deal with situations – we're talking about a child.",
      "\"It was a natural child reaction which you would expect and you expect them to keep going on. You know what it's like with you kids, something happens and they want to keep on going on and you're trying to manage the situation.",
      "\"But he's a professional athlete who's the captain of Manchester United football club, he needs to be stronger and blank everything out because you're playing for the biggest club in the world right now, and if that affects him, the referee bumping him, then they've got big, serious issues already.\"",
      "Walcott continued: \"Get him off penalty duties, get him off the captain's armband perhaps? Because, for me, if that was another player, you think [Cristiano] Ronaldo is going to? [react the same way] absolutely no chance, do you think Odegaard at Arsenal? [would react the same way] absolutely no chance. Bruno Fernandes' reaction has really surprised me but it's got us talking about that instead of the result.\"",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise and that was what triggered me in the moment but that's not the excuse to miss a penalty. I just had a very bad hit of the ball, I took my foot too under the ball and that's why it went over the bar.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was also asked about the controversy. Amorim said: \"He knows the importance that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team. He was like, not so happy, not so involved, because he has so much responsibility. I think he felt that missed penalty, it was huge for us.\"",
      "Fernandes didn't start in United's shock defeat on penalties to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. However, he came on in the second half of the 2-2 draw and did score twice in the marathon shootout that ultimately saw United's season go from bad to worse as they were dumped out of the competition.",
      "New signing Bryan Mbeumo missed the final spot kick, which dumped Amorim's side out. Fernandes' attributes as captain were on display, though, in the aftermath of the crushing defeat, as he immediately went to Mbeumo’s side to console his team-mate, before escorting him back to the dressing room as fans invaded the pitch.",

      "Summer is yet to pass but Benjamin Sesko's debut campaign at Manchester United is already showing signs of fracture. The Slovenian, 22, was given his first start in the League Cup second round clash against Grimsby Town.",
      "It proved to be a nightmare first outing as Ruben Amorim's side drew 2-2 with the League Two outfit before losing 12-11 on penalties. The humiliating exit at Blundell Park is not what the striker would have envisaged when he snubbed Newcastle United to join the Red Devils from RB Leipzig in a deal which could be worth as much as £74million.",
      "As well as being unable to beat Town goalkeeper Christy Pym, more alarmingly Sesko was the 10th player for United to take a penalty in the shootout, with only Andre Onana behind him. While he did convert his spot-kick, his placement in the order spoke volumes, as it suggests either he or Amorim was not particularly confident he would score from 12-yards.",
      "The defeat to the Mariners is certainly not what Sesko envisaged when he opted against playing Champions League football at St James' Park. The young forward said he was looking forward to competing for the biggest trophies in football when he arrived.",
      "He said: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future. When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.\"",
      "That hope already appears to be over, as United now only have two trophies left to compete for: the Premier League, which does not appear within their grasp anytime soon, and the FA Cup. The forward also said there was a positive buzz at Old Trafford - if there was, last night's result and their poor start to the season would have done plenty to extinguish it, particularly judging by Amorim's words after the match.",
      "Sesko added: \"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "\"I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "If the visible stress on the faces of Amorim and his team-mates are anything to go by, then the \"positive energy\" Sesko spoke off has evaporated. The future was looking positive after United's respectable showing in their 1-0 home loss to Arsenal.",
      "New signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have looked impressive this season, yet the duo, who cost close to £125m, both missed in the shootout. Sesko's hopes of learning from Amorim may have also taken a hit, as the Portuguese boss' post-match interview suggested the club's consistently poor performances have driven him to the edge.",
      "He cryptically said: \"I know that the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch. I think the team and the players spoke really loud today. So that's it.",
      "\"We lost, the best team won. I think it was really clear for everybody what happened today. It's not just the space (we gave them), but the way we started the game without any intensity - we were completely lost.",
      "\"It's hard to explain. That's why I think they spoke really well. I think they gave the response on the pitch today. When you see something that, like today, it's hard to talk.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim has ratcheted up following Manchester United’s humiliating Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby Town. The Red Devils’ failure to qualify for Europe meant they took part in the second round of the competition for the first time since 2014, when Louis van Gaal’s side were humbled 4-0 by League One outfit MK Dons.",
      "More pain was to follow as Grimsby inflicted the club’s first-ever defeat to a fourth-tier side. The hosts deservedly led at half time through goals from Charles Vernam and United product Tyrell Warren.",
      "Under-fire goalkeeper Andre Onana should have done better for the first goal and was embarrassed for the second. But United fought back to 2-2 thanks to substitute Bryan Mbeumo’s strike and a last-gasp Harry Maguire header.",
      "Matheus Cunha wasted the chance to win the shootout after Onana had denied Clarke Oduor, with Mbeumo eventually sending his second effort off the crossbar in a 12-11 loss that will leave deep scars. The defeat continued Amorim’s wretched record since he replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Despite spending more than £200million this summer, United have made a slow start to their Premier League campaign. And after deservedly losing to the side currently fourth in League Two, pundits are struggling to see how the Portuguese coach can turn things around, raising the prospect he could soon be sacked.",
      "Speaking on BBC Five Live, former Chelsea and Celtic striker Chris Sutton said: “What an embarrassment for Manchester United. Where does Ruben Amorim go from here?\"",
      "Sutton accepted: “The perception of him now... I don't think he gets over this. A grim night in Grimsby for Ruben's reds.”",
      "When asked if United could consider axing Amorim, former Red Devils striker Louis Saha gave his verdict to ITV Sport after full time and also admitted: “I think they have some consideration. They have to have a bit of a rough attitude. This ground is difficult to come to but it’s what they’re here for; they have to perform.",
      "“They have to find solutions. At the moment, we need to see better, speed of play, all this is missing. All the courage you expect from Man United, the quality, it’s not there. They have to regroup and find solutions.”",
      "“It might be switching away from my belief in a system or a formation, and I just don’t think he is. You look at the amount of games he’s lost since he’s been there.",
      "“Week in, week out, they are not getting a level of performance they should be out of that side. Yes, there’s underperformance. Yes, there’s a culture that needs a bit of a shift, but he is not getting the best out of that group.”",
      "United cannot afford another setback on Saturday when newly promoted Burnley head to Old Trafford. Anything other than a convincing win for the Red Devils ahead of the international break – with a short trip to Manchester City awaiting them on September 14 – could yet prove too much for Amorim. Only time will tell.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been panned by Manchester United supporters after waiting until the 10th penalty to step up against Grimsby. United were embarrassed as they exited the Carabao Cup in the second round against the League Two side and Sesko was among those to flop.",
      "Ruben Amorim found themselves 2-0 down inside 30 minutes, with Andre Onana at fault for both goals. They managed to claw it back to 2-2, with Bryan Mbeumo scoring his first United goal and Harry Maguire heading in a corner late on.",
      "But that only delayed the embarrassment, as Grimsby kept their cool to win 12-11 on penalties as Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo missed. Sesko scored his effort, but didn’t escape criticism on social media on a chastening night for the club.",
      "The 22-year-old striker joined United from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74million earlier this month and came off the bench in their opening two Premier League matches. He was handed his first start for the club at Grimsby and did not impress.",
      "The Slovenia international had two shots on target in the first half, but both were comfortably held by Grimsby goalkeeper Christy Pym. He struggled to combine with his team-mates, completing just seven of his 11 attempted passes, and fired over the bar in the closing stages as United failed to find a winner against a side who finished ninth in the fourth tier last season.",
      "There was also a comical attempted overhead kick to cringe at, prompting one user on Reddit to comment: “The new Hojlund is looking good.”",
      "But it was Sesko’s failure to step up earlier in the shoot-out which caused the most confusion. He was the last outfield player to take a penalty, with defenders Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt all scoring before him.",
      "“Sesko being the 10th penalty taker was also so weird to me. He’s taken 11 in his career and not missed any,” one fan wrote on X. “The most embarrassing thing was Sesko taking the 10th penalty,” another added. “His confidence must be on the floor.”",
      "A third wrote: “Benjamin Sesko going 10th in a penalty shoot-out vs League Two opposition has to be a major red flag from a £70m centre-forward.”",
      "Sesko scored 21 goals in 45 games for Leipzig last season and has 16 goals in 41 caps for Slovenia. And yet he looked a shadow of himself in the pouring rain on Wednesday night as the game passed him by.",
      "Amorim emptied the bench as United ended the game with Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee up front and Mbeumo, Cunha and Bruno Fernandes behind them. But they still appeared blunt in attack in an extremely worrying performance for the side that finished 15th in the Premier League last season.",
      "Amorim’s words post-match only added to the concern. “In the end, it doesn't matter if we recover or not, it's the signs the team gave during the game, the beginning of the game,” he said.",
      "“I think the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch. The best players lose because one team can win against any group of players, and I think the team and the players spoke really loud today, so that's it. We lost, the best team won.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim sparked fresh scrutiny over his future with his comments after Manchester United's humbling exit from the Carabao Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town.",
      "United were dumped out of a tournament they won as recently as 2023 at the first hurdle by the League Two outfit, who deserved to advance in normal time after taking a 2-0 lead. Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire denied them such a feat, but the Mariners deservedly prevailed on penalties. While Grimsby revelled in the moment, United were left to contemplate a shocking new low.",
      "A shell-shocked Amorim offered no excuses after the game and some of his comments have fuelled speculation on social media that the former Sporting Lisbon chief is on the verge of contemplating his own future. He conceded \"something has to change\" but it would not be \"22 players again\".",
      "“I think this is a little bit the limit. I think something has to change,” Amorim said during an honest post-match assessment. “I think the team and the players spoke really loud today, so that’s it. [Tonight] I think the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch.",
      "“I think it's really clear what they spoke, so let's move on from this day. I think it was clear for everybody what happened today. The way we start the game without any intensity, we were completely lost. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.”",
      "With speculation over Amorim's future rife on social media following the Grimsby game, his post-match comments are a far cry from his response when people questioned him after Manchester United's defeat in the Europa League final back in May.",
      "In the aftermath of that loss against Tottenham, Amorim insisted he would walk away for free if fans or the top brass at Manchester United were to lose faith in him as the club's head coach.",
      "He said defiantly at the time: “If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation. But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.",
      "“In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has hinted crunch talks must be had surrounding Manchester United's current crisis and his own future after the club's embarrassing Carabao Cup exit. The Red Devils became the biggest scalp of the competition so far after they were eliminated on penalties by League Two outfit Grimsby Town.",
      "The hosts took a shock 2-0 lead in the first half as the rain poured down, and they were cruelly denied a third that should have stood. Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire eventually ensured the match would head to penalties.",
      "After a lengthy shoot-out that saw all 11 players take at least a spot-kick each, Mbeumo's second effort of the night hit the crossbar as United's misery was confirmed.",
      "The defeat spelled the first time the Premier League side had been knocked out of the tournament in the second round for more than a decade. It was under Louis van Gaal that United were dismantled 4-0 by MK Dons as Amorim has once again written himself in the history books for the wrong reasons.",
      "It's been a dire start to the season for United, who've yet to record a win. Amorim twice admitted after the full-time whistle that he intends to discuss his future with the club and the current state of play after their next Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday ahead of the international break.",
      "Speaking to MUTV after Wednesday's loss, Amorim said: \"In the end, the penalties don’t matter. After the game, the penalties if you win or you lose, the feeling [about the 90 minutes] should be the same.\"",
      "He first revealed: \"Let’s focus on the next game and then we have time to think about things. We have a lot of debts with our fans so let’s focus on the game.\" Amorim then doubled down, adding: \"We have a job to do, a job to prepare and then we’ll stop and think things through.\"",
      "Amorim lamented the regression he's seen in his players since their opening day 1-0 loss to Arsenal at Old Trafford where he was buoyed by their performance despite the narrow defeat to a rival. \"I would like to say very smart things and very important things,\" Amorim added.",
      "\"I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I’m really sorry for our fans. It’s too much sometimes.",
      "\"When everything is so important in our club and you try to do everything. You have come from pre-season, even Arsenal you lose the game but you are there, you are improving and you see the performance, but then reach this kind of game, when everything is so important in our club.\"",
      "The 40-year-old wasn't afraid take aim at his players as he continued: \"And when you start a game like this… I think my players are talking really loud about what they want, so I’m really sorry to our fans, I have nothing to say anymore.\"",
      "United have one point on the board so far, having drawn 1-1 at Fulham on Sunday. Another setback against Scott Parker's newly promoted Burnley this weekend would leave the club in turmoil with a fortnight to make decisions behind the scenes before a short trip to Manchester City awaits.",

And while United rallied through goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire to seemingly salvage the game in normal time, they went on to lose on penalties in one of the biggest cup shocks in recent memory.",

      "The Cameroon international's position has United's No 1 has long been scrutinised after a string of poor displays and it remains to be seen if he will remain as the team's first-choice keeper moving forward. But Amorim refused to twist the knife after he was asked about Onana post-match.",
      "“With all respect when you play against a fourth division team, it's not the goalkeeper, it's everything,” Amorim raged. “It's the environment. It's the way we face the competition. Everything. With that performance today my players spoke for me really loud.”",

United rescued themselves from embarrassment in normal time, but couldn't hold their nerve from 12 yards as The Mariners enjoyed a famous victory with those from Manchester having to deal with an extremely low moment.",
      "Neville has done his customary predictions for the season and put the Red Devils in the top four, despite them finishing 15th last season. He claimed that their performance in their loss to Arsenal had given him hope that they were in fact heading in the right direction.",

I think they'll get a goalkeeper, I'm banking on it. When they bring a goalkeeper in and you've got those players up front with that backline, I think with the free weeks they've got and no Europa League, I think United will surprise a few.\"",

However, it was Mbeumo who would eventually miss the decisive penalty, seeing his second effort hit the bar after all 11 players took a spot kick.",

He cut a hugely frustrated figure post-match and was honest enough to concede he could not explain the performance.",

      "Belgian shotstopper Senne Lammens is still on their radar and talks continue with Royal Antwerp, but much of their focus is on offloading individuals who have fallen down the pecking order. Marcus Rashford is the only big name to achieve an exit thus far, joining Barcelona.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony remain at the club. The latter pair spent last season away on loan and whilst the preference is for permanent sales, United may settle on temporary exits if time is against them.",
      "Real Betis are keen on having Antony back whilst Sancho is thought to have turned down a move to Roma. Rasmus Hojlund meanwhile is close to an Italian return. Here's the latest from the red side of Manchester.",
      "Chelsea are not prepared to meet United's valuation for Garnacho. The Manchester club want around £50m for the winger - down on their asking price from January - but front-runners Chelsea aren't prepared to go that high.",
      "The west Londoner's valuation sits between £25m and £35m. The Blues are believed to have agreed terms with the player, who has reportedly turned down interest from elsewhere and has set his sights on Stamford Bridge - something which could be to Chelsea's benefit in negotiations with United.",
      "United have attempted to justify their valuation by pointing to Chelsea's sale of Noni Madueke, according to The Times. Madueke, who scored seven goals to Garnacho's six across comparable league minutes last term, joined Arsenal for £48m plus add-ons in July.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is closing on a Manchester exit but the young striker is still 'desperate' to remain at Old Trafford despite the big money signing of Sesko. It's no secret that Hojlund is now effectively surplus to requirements.",
      "The Dane has been the subject of strong interest from Napoli and a deal to take the former Atalanta man back to Italy, initially on loan, is now at an advanced stage. However, The Daily Mail report that Hojlund's preference by far would be to stay and fight for his place at United - even though he was left out of the matchday squad for Sunday's draw with Fulham.",
      "While Hojlund would rather stay the expectation is that he will still leave Old Trafford before the September 1 deadline, which will ease the burden on their resources.",
      "United's continued failures in the transfer market is best summed up by research and data which shows that their squad is now worth more than £300million LESS than they actually paid for it. Their squad cost vs their actual value presents the largest deficit in the Premier League.",
      "They are £322.9m in the minus. They've spent £1.1billion but their squad is actually valued at £769m by Transfermarkt. For context, Arsenal are the best in the Premier League in this department. Their squad is worth £315.9m more than they actually paid - £826m vs £1.1bn.",

      "“Sacked in the morning.” “Can we play you every week?” “Premier League, you’re having a laugh.” Those were just three chants aimed at Manchester United by Grimsby Town supporters in the first half alone.",
      "That is Grimsby Town of League Two. The fourth tier in English football. A team that was competing in the National League a few years ago.",
      "This was not a United team teeming with unknowns or untried novices, as they were against Port Vale in 1994 or MK Dons in 2014. This was a United side assembled at a cost of £401.61million. For 45 minutes, this was worse than MK Dons.",
      "There was a United comeback, but it was incomplete. A marathon penalty shootout ended 12-11 to Grimsby Town. Bryan Mbeumo ended the charade by striking the crossbar.",
      "That sparked a mass pitch invasion. Bruno Fernandes rushed to Mbeumo to escort him off. Harry Maguire signalled to his teammates to head to the tunnel. United’s security personnel did likewise with alacrity.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s body language resembled that of a condemned coach for much of the night. At one point, he looked to be bickering with his assistant, Carlos Fernandes. Those sunny days in Chicago during the pre-season tour last month, where Amorim was tanned and breezy, feel like a reverie.",
      "Amorim, sodden from the biblical second-half rain, ran onto the pitch to fetch the ball in the 84th minute. “Oi, Amorim, your lot aren’t very good,” yelled a Grimsby fan. He was soon silenced by Harry Maguire’s equaliser.",
      "That was a brief reprieve. The shootout defeat tempers this humiliation but this will be remembered as one of United’s most shocking cup defeats. One to file with Bournemouth 1984, York City 1995, Southend 2006, Leeds 2010 and MK Dons 2014.",
      "Andre Onana headed down the tunnel at full-time, followed by goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital. He re-emerged and was advised to remain calm by Fernandes for the spotkicks. Fernandes was soon anything but, urging Altay Bayindir to advise Onana to hand the ball to United’s next taker.",
      "Onana produced a superb stop from Clarke Oduor in the penalty shootout yet was thereafter porous. Matheus Cunha lost his nerve with a potential matchwinning penalty. United's first two summer signings missed.",
      "United players are playing their way out of the club. That Amorim has messily mismanaged the goalkeeper situation does not account for Onana’s incompetence for both of Grimsby’s goals. Onana was flimsy for the first and a pushover for the second.",
      "Onana’s confidence has doubtless been harmed by the contrary call to start Bayindir in the opening Premier League games. That does not legislate for a League Two club making him look an amateur. Amorim did not appreciate the recommendation of Tom Heaton but he was the safest bet to start this season.",
      "At a club where anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, a former United academy member threatened to get the winner. Tyrell Warren spent part of his summer training with his long-time friend, Marcus Rashford, to prepare him for his transfer to Barcelona. Rashford can be forgiven for celebrating his old teammate's glory against his parent club.",
      "United’s starting academy defender, Tyler Fredricson, was a boy among men and repeatedly targeted but criminally devoid of a teammate to protect him. Maguire, captaining United at kick-off for the first time since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, regained his old form. He handed the armband back to Fernandes for the second half and connected with Mason Mount’s corner to extend the evening.",
      "But this was no rescue act. Instead, individuals, the head coach and his staff have been brutally exposed. Patrick Dorgu played kick-and-rush in the blood and thunder. He was not on the pitch when the torrential rain turned United’s shirts blood red. The sharks may scent blood soon.",
      "Dorgu was overpromoted and is being overplayed, starting every game by virtue of his status as the sole senior left winger. Dorgu is 20 years old and arrived from Lecce in January.",
      "Some are giving up on Manuel Ugarte at United and he looked to throw in the towel himself, staying prone and seeking a free kick seconds before Charles Vernam slammed the ball into the corner for the opening goal. Fredricson, Ugarte and Dorgu had to take their seats in the raucous main stand after their showers.",
      "Fernandes, Mbeumo and Matthijs de Ligt emerged at the pause. Diogo Dalot switched to the left wing and United had five No.10s and a striker in their front seven for the second half. Mbeumo scored one of the most uncelebrated first goals by a United player.",
      "Amorim’s head dropped and he slumped back down to his haunches when Amad lost the ball. That was at 0-0. Amorim was in a narky mood long before Grimsby changed the scoreboard and caused ripples in the North Sea.",
      "Grimsby will not have cowed a team more easily than United. Cowards may be a more fitting description. Rumbustious tackles put certain individuals out of the game, the tone set by an early and fair challenge on Amad. Rather than get up, he milked the contact. Amad did not fancy it.",
      "Amorim lost his rag inside two minutes, smacking his hands and shouting in the direction of Dorgu. He was more demonstrative than usual and constantly on Sesko’s case, piqued that he was positionally distant without the ball.",
      "Sesko was out of kilter with his new teammates. Hardly a shock when he was held back in the first two fixtures against Arsenal and Fulham. United seem oblivious as to how to function with a centre forward in their starting XI. It was hardly a ringing endorsement that Sesko was the final outfield player to take a penalty kick.",
      "Calendars have not been turned over to September and opposition supporters are already wondering when Amorim will go. The United away end, already subdued at 0-0, was numb at 1-0 and catatonic at 2-0. They eventually mustered a rendition of ‘We’ll never die’ as half-time loomed and that was funereal.",
      "1,200 United supporters crammed into a stand with advertising for Winner Winner Chicken Dinner and Copes Readymix Ltd. This was a more authentic ground than United’s last second-round League Cup tie, the infamous 4-0 shellacking at MK Dons in 2014. The parallels were glaring.",
      "Louis van Gaal fielded the untried that evening and was so unfussed by the hammering he started signing autographs at full-time. Amorim could not afford to be as blasé and United were still worse than Louis’s lambs that were slaughtered 11 years ago.",
      "United’s pricey substitutes were heckled with the familiar Football League chorus of, “Who are ya?” De Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee were without a seat and were ordered to move further back by the fastidious fourth official. There was not a spare seat at the all-seater Blundell Park as 8,647 spectators packed it out.",
      "Amorim is almost on his knees.",

      "Ruben Amorim stood with his hands on his hips as Blundell Park erupted into celebration.",
      "Manchester United’s players trudged back to the halfway line for the restart. Then Grimsby extended their advantage just eight minutes later after a calamity from a corner.",
      "The worst results were supposed to be behind United after a shocking 2024/25 season, but they somehow reached a new low during an embarrassing 90 minutes.",
      "Fans were starting to question Amorim after learning Kobbie Mainoo's future is uncertain. Some argued there is no long-term future for Amorim at Old Trafford if he cannot accommodate such a talent.",
      "The performance against Grimsby will put more pressure on Amorim at a time of the season that was supposed to be full of optimism. The morale in the dressing room significantly improved throughout the summer, Amorim was backed with big-money signings and pre-season was positive.",
      "But results dictate the narrative. There were positives to take from Arsenal, United went backwards against Fulham, which was followed by League Two opposition completing a giant-killing.",
      "Rightly or wrongly, the conversation about how long Amorim lasts has already started. Fans on the train back to Manchester from Craven Cottage were overheard talking about it last weekend.",
      "United had £401million worth of talent in the starting team against Grimsby and they looked second best in most departments.",
      "Amorim made three changes at the break, introducing Matthijs de Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, meaning there were essentially five attacking players on the pitch (Fernandes, Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad and Benjamin Sesko).",
      "There were a few promising attacks, but United struggled to threaten for large parts of the game, which must concern club chiefs after spending close to £200m to overhaul the front line.",
      "Shortly after the hour mark, Amorim made another attacking change by replacing Ayden Heaven with Mason Mount. Mount was introduced at left wing-back, which confirmed United were in panic mode.",
      "Amorim looked like a manager who was close to the edge on the touchline. He started the game by man-managing each red shirt and that should not be the case after 10 months in charge of the club.",
      "The players should know their roles without Amorim encouraging them into certain areas of the pitch. There were teething problems with the system last season and they don't seem to be over.",
      "Amorim could not believe what he was watching from the touchline and, as the rain hammered down, he probably wondered why he swapped a successful life in Portgual for a seemingly impossible job.",
      "United's head coach will be scrutinised after crashing out of the Carabao Cup. It was Mbeumo who scored to make it 2-1 and Mount who delivered the corner into the box for the equaliser, so his changes worked, but United faltered in the penalty shootout.",
      "\"You're getting sacked in the morning, sacked in the morning,\" taunted the Grimsby fans at one stage. Amorim knows his side must do better to prevent the pressure from increasing.",
      "United's head coach will take responsibility for one of the biggest shocks in the club's history. When comparing the two United teams, this result is worse than the defeat to MK Dons with Louis van Gaal in charge in 2014.",
      "Van Gaal named a makeshift starting team for that game, while Amorim had £401m worth of talent on the pitch.",
      "It simply isn't acceptable, and Amorim knows it.",

      "Manchester United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by League Two Grimsby after a 2-2 draw in 90 minutes.",
      "The home side took the lead when Charles Vernam’s effort beat Andre Onana at his near post, and the United goalkeeper committed another error just eight minutes later as he failed to deal with a cross before Tyrell Warren bundled the ball home.",
      "United introduced Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo at half time and the latter handed United a lifeline with his first goal for the club. Harry Maguire headed United level in the 89th minute.",
      "Clarke Oduor and Matheus Cunha missed in the penalty shootout to send it to sudden death. Mbeumo missed the decisive penalty as Grimsby won the shootout 12-11.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Blundell Park:",
      "Andre Onana",
      "Came back into the side and was culpable for both goals. Flimsy and gettable, he is playing his way out of the club. Great save in the shootout and scored. 5",
      "Tyler Fredricson",
      "A boy among men. Grimsby targeted him repeatedly and Fredricson was devoid of a senior teammate to help him out. Substituted at half-time. 2",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Reclaimed the captain’s armband and rediscovered his old, bad form. Unsettled from the start and could not shore United up. But scored another big goal. 7",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Lacked composure and too casual amid the blood and thunder of a League Two ground. Seemed to underestimate Grimsby. 4",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Dismal at both ends. Failed to protect Fredricson and failed to provide adequate service in the final third. Scored in the shootout. 4",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Demanded a foul in the build-up to Grimsby’s first goal. People at the club are giving up on him and you can see why. Not up to it. Hooked at the interval. 2",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "The best of a bad bunch in the first half but prone to careless errors with the ball. Not a performance to play his way back into the side but great penalty. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Played kick-and-rush. Playing by default amid the absence of an established left winger and getting found out weekly. 2",
      "Amad",
      "Cowed early on and fortunate to emerge for the second half. Did not get anywhere all night. 3",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "For the first time in a United shirt, failed to impose himself against the weakest opponent. Tried without succeeding. Dreadful penalty. 4",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Out of kilter with his new teammates for most of the evening but came closest to scoring in the first half. Slotted in his penalty. 5",
      "Subs",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Brought some much-needed authority to United’s play. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Actually appeared capable of defending. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Scored his first goal for the club. Missed the decisive penalty. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Gamely occupied the left wing. Crossed for Maguire to score. 7",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Imbecilic foul but scored a penalty in sudden death. 6",
      "Manager",
      "Amorim’s body language has never looked worse. He picked a strong enough team but United regressed egregiously. Mbeumo came on to score and fellow substitute Mount assisted Maguire. 5",

      "Manchester United suffered a shock defeat against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night.",
      "United were entered into the second round of the competition due to their failure to qualify for Europe, and Blundell Park was a sell-out for the visit of the Reds.",
      "Grimsby were 2-0 at half-time and sensed a giant-killing. United fought back with goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire to force a penalty shootout, but the hosts prevailed to inflict an embarrassing defeat on Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Here are some talking points from the game and some moments you might have missed.:",
      "Amorim pointing the finger",
      "Just seven minutes into the game, Amorim turned to his coaching staff on the bench and waved his arms in frustration. He was unhappy that Matheus Cunha hadn’t heard an instruction and was also on the case of Tyler Fredricson, shouting about the areas of the pitch he should be playing in.",
      "Fredricson received an earful from Amorim in the first half and Kobbie Mainoo was irked by his fellow academy graduate when he passed the ball inside instead of playing the pass wide to Diogo Dalot.",
      "Amorim was on the case of pretty much everyone, though. He was not pleased by Grimsby making a fast start and was practically man-managing every player to inform them where they should be.",
      "There are no excuses for Amorim this season. The 40-year-old has had enough time to get his message across and shouldn’t need to be man-managing players during a game at this stage of his tenure.",
      "Penalty drama",
      "Grimsby took the first penalty in the shootout, but Andre Onana did not pick up the ball to give it to Bruno Fernandes for his spotkick. Onana did the same when Mbeumo stepped up for the first time and Fernandes quickly reacted, shouting at him to give the next United penalty taker the ball.",
      "Fernandes even had to shout at Bayindir at one stage. Fernandes wanted Onana's goalkeeping colleague to pass on the message, and the Cameroon international eventually received it.",
      "Shootouts are decided by small margins and Onana did not seem prepared for the game to reach that stage.",
      "Fernandes consoles Mbeumo",
      "Grimsby fans invaded the pitch when Mbeumo missed his penalty. Thousands of fans rushed onto the turf, and some of their supporters taunted Mbeumo, who was accompanied by Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes went to Mbeumo’s side to protect and console his dejected teammate. The United captain escorted him back to the dressing room alongside a United staff member.",
      "Amorim's shock",
      "What were the odds on Grimsby progressing to the next round of the Carabao Cup? United were the bookmakers’ heavy favourites and an upset was not anticipated at Blundell Park.",
      "For Grimsby’s first goal, Manuel Ugarte lost the ball and spent time appealing to the referee instead of trying to atone for his mistake (how many times have we seen that with Ugarte?). Onana should have done better with the low strike and Amorim stood shell-shocked on the touchline.",
      "Blundell Park erupted and Amorim watched on helplessly with his hands on his hips. Then Amorim cut the same figure when Grimsby scored again just eight minutes later.",
      "Taunts from Grimsby fans",
      "Grimsby’s admin on X celebrated when the Carabao Cup draw was made. The chance to welcome United to Blundell Park promised a great occasion, but even the most optimistic of Grimsby fans wouldn’t have predicted their first half performance, which saw them lead 2-0.",
      "Their fans savoured every moment. “Premier League, you’re having a laugh,” was the taunt from the stands, along with a message for Amorim. “You’re getting sacked in the morning,” they chanted.",
      "\"Who the f****** hell are you?\" Grimsby's fans added. The 1,200 fans in the away section were stunned into silence.",
      "Maguire with the armband",
      "Maguire lost the captain’s armband in 2023 but he reclaimed it against Grimsby.",
      "The defender’s redemption arc has been a remarkable story and he deserved to wear the armband. Maguire has been a model professional since the armband was taken away from him by Erik ten Hag and has never sulked about his ‘demotion’.",
      "Now more than ever, United need leaders in the dressing room.",

      "The loss is destined to be ranked among United's biggest domestic cup embarrassments and restricts them to one realistic option of silverware this season in the FA Cup.",

      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",

      "\"It's not about Andre,\" Amorim stressed. \"We are here with all due respect. I already said that the best team won. But this is a fourth division team. Andre should play just with his feet during this game? It's not that that happened.",
      "\"It's not the goalkeeper. It's more than that. He's everybody. Thank you guys.\"",

      "\"Don’t rule Newcastle out of this either, especially since they’ve lost Joelinton and Sandro Tonali (to injuries). If they lost Bissouma, could Tottenham come into it? Possibly. I’d keep an eye on Newcastle, and I think there are quite a lot of Premier League clubs interested in him. I wouldn’t rule Everton out either. I think half the Premier League have inquired about him, asked about him. Manchester United will be aware of him too.\"",

      "Manchester United suffered a major setback after they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town on Wednesday night.",
      "The home side opened the scoring when Charles Vernam's shot beat Andre Onana at the near post. Then, just eight minutes later, the United goalkeeper was at fault again, failing to deal with a cross that allowed Tyrell Warren to bundle the ball into an empty net.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo netted his first goal for the club with 15 minutes remaining, before Harry Maguire equalised for United with a header in the 89th minute. In the penalty shootout, misses from Clarke Oduor and Matheus Cunha took the contest to sudden death.",
      "Ultimately, it was Mbeumo who missed the decisive spot-kick, handing Grimsby a dramatic 12-11 victory. And below is a look at what the national media had to say on events at Blundell Park.",
      "'Manchester United sink to new low after losing penalty shoot-out to Grimsby'",
      "The Telegraph's Mike McGrath wrote: \"This infamous defeat amid lightning and thunderstorms in Cleethorpes only adds weight to Ruben Amorim’s assessment that we are watching the worst team in Manchester United’s history. The unrestrained joy of Grimsby's celebrations should be the lasting memory of this League Cup tie but it will inevitably be United sinking to one of their lowest moments in the modern era.",
      "\"Amorim was goaded by home fans, suggesting he would be sacked in the morning. The Portuguese coach will last longer, yet this embarrassing giant-killing will lead to questions over whether this team are set up to win matches in English football. Up against their League Two opponents, they looked shell-shocked facing players with more will to win. While they mounted a comeback from 2-0 down to force penalties, they had clearly done no homework on spot kicks as Andre Onana seemed to be jumping away from the ball as each strike found the net.",
      "\"Some of the best talent at Amorim’s disposal has left or is leaving the club, while those who have remained are not getting used properly. United’s team were littered with expensive signings and full internationals, yet they fell short in the basics of the game to a team 56 places below them in the football pyramid. They were battered like the fish brought into the nearby port.\"",
      "'Man United humiliated by Grimsby in shoot-out epic after Onana howler'",
      "Paul Hirst of The Times wrote: \"The Main Stand at Blundell Park has experienced some sights and sounds in its 124-year existence, but it has never heard a roar like the one that bellowed around this ground after Bryan Mbeumo missed the penalty that condemned Manchester United to one of the most embarrassing defeats in their history. When Mbeumo’s penalty struck the bar, giving Grimsby Town a 12-11 penalty shoot-out win, mums and dads in the home end hoisted their young ones in the air, mates wearing black-and-white shirts embraced and many of them dabbed a tear from their eye.",
      "\"Never have they experienced such a feeling, but then again, never have Grimsby put a club with such history as United to the sword. As the celebrations broke out, five yards in front of this grand old Victorian stand stood Ruben Amorim, drenched and demoralised after watching his team defeated by League Two opposition. Amorim wants to get his team back into Europe. He will not be able to qualify through the Carabao Cup because his pathetic excuse of a team fell at the first hurdle in one of the greatest shocks that this competition has ever known.",
      "\"So much for the pre-season optimism surrounding United. This was an even more embarrassing loss than other shock defeats, such as the one to MK Dons 11 years ago. Grimsby did not fluke their way to this shock win. They did not put ten men behind the ball and nick two lucky goals. They deserved to win, they had more quality, more composure, more desire and they looked more tactically astute. Those last two points in particular should worry Amorim’s paymasters the most. How can a team of the fourth division press the United defence into submission? How can they make Benjamin Sesko look so poor. And why was the Slovenian the last outfield player to take a penalty in the XI?\"",
      "'Glorious Grimsby humiliate Man United with shootout victory'",
      "Jamie Jackson of The Guardian wrote: \"Manchester United – bloody hell. After a quasi-farcical display that somehow pulled them back to 2-2 and penalties, Ruben Amorim’s rabble lost a fevered shootout 12-11.. Amorim’s men lost it – so the inquest begins. The head coach and his side hobble next to the visit of Burnley on Saturday. It does not need a vivid imagination to picture United losing that one too and extending their winless run to the opening four outings of an already stricken campaign.",
      "\"Amorim may survive a defeat at Old Trafford – he has just overseen a £200m-plus summer spend, after all – but the bottom line is this: nine months into the job the head coach continues to put out a team that lack verve, flair, solidity and anything approaching a discernible pattern of play. After the farrago of his side’s performance Amorim stood pitchside and was regaled with jubilant verses of 'you’re getting sacked in the morning': this cruel wit sharply crystallises the state United are in – and their coach is culpable.",
      "\"Cue a Grimsby support in party mode, their taunts a cutting 'can we play you every week', and 'Premier League/you’re having a laugh'. They had a point. Grimsby were in cruise control, toying with their shellshocked guest. When Sesko managed a header you were reminded that United were allowed to attack – too. Amorim’s substitutions had failed to engineer any dominance and when Diallo was flagged offside his manager dipped his head in anguish – a regular sensation for him.\"",
      "'Man United hit new low against Grimsby to raise unthinkable Ruben Amorim question'",
      "Pete Hall of The Independent wrote: \"Manchester United getting battered in Grimsby is a headline that writes itself. But nothing plucked from the North Sea has ever been treated to this kind of humiliation. Four hundred million pounds. 711 Premier League appearances between them. And that was just the starting XI. This was not your bog-standard cup giant-killing, when a plucky minnow overcomes an elite top-flight side who have rested their 11 best players.",
      "\"Grimsby Town, three divisions below, played the might of Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, off the park for long periods of a football match. They did not weather an almighty westerly storm. Their goalkeeper did not have to have the game of his life. They deserved their place in the history books. But be under no illusion, sneaking through to a shootout thanks to a Harry Maguire header at the death, when you have your entire attacking arsenal on the pitch, is humiliating enough.",
      "\"Never mind getting sacked in the morning, Ruben Amorim must be considering walking after this. How much more can one man take? Just when you thought Manchester United couldn’t make things any worse, they remain the gift that keeps on giving. You couldn’t tell as the match got underway. United were second to everything.\"",

      "On Wednesday, Sancho posted a small insight into the bomb squad at Carrington on his Instagram story. Posing alongside Antony, Malacia and the injured Lisandro Martinez, the former Borussia Dortmund star put: \"My brothers\".",
      "Martinez has been out injured with an ACL injury since February while the other three are believed to have been training separately to the United first team.",

      "It's difficult to predict how active Manchester United will be in the final five days of the summer transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men have completed the majority of their business with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all arriving to upgrade the forward line. Diego Leon has come in to provide depth at left wing-back, although he hasn't played in the first two games.",
      "A new goalkeeper in the shape of Senne Lammens looks set to become signing number five at Old Trafford to compete with Andre Onana. Beyond that, any surprise moves between now and Monday's 7pm deadline seems unlikely.",
      "Back to the prediction earlier, it's nearly impossible to land on whether United will be busy. On one hand, they've done what was needed but on the other, the midfield has emerged as a problem in the first two games of the season.",
      "Amorim has lined-up with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in front of the back three against Arsenal and Fulham. Against the Gunners, Manuel Ugarte came on and was poor before Mason Mount partnered Fernandes in the pivot. To say that 'trial' of two attacking midfielders playing deep didn't work is an understatement, Ugarte came on 11 minutes later.",
      "The draw at Craven Cottage left more questions than answers over Kobbie Mainoo. Despite starting for England in a European Championship final 12 months ago and scoring in the FA Cup final for the club two months before, the 20-year-old seemingly has no place in Amorim's vision.",
      "\"He's fighting for the position now with Bruno and I change two midfielders,\" the United boss said. \"I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he [Mainoo] just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. He's going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he's fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "It's been reported that Mainoo is now open to leaving the club before the window closes on Monday. The Athletic have reported that the club have been considering the prospect of selling the midfielder all summer.",
      "Fernandes has not been at his best for United so far this season and missed a penalty at Fulham. Mbeumo and Cunha's introduction to the 3-4-3 system means Fernandes is playing deeper than previously.",
      "The Athletic have reported that the club's search throughout the summer has been focused on alternatives to the Portugal international. For the majority of the window, it had seemed as though the recruitment team were gunning for a defensive midfielder to partner Fernandes.",
      "Now aged 30, turning 31 next month, Fernandes' long-term future at the club isn't guaranteed. Come next summer, interest is likely to resurface and by then, United may well be in a position to sign his replacement after spending the summer identifying possible alternatives.",
      "Next summer, Amorim could reshuffle his midfield to land on an ideal partnership - perhaps even without Fernandes - consisting of an elite box-to-box creator to partner Ugarte, or Carlos Baleba if he is still a target.",

      "Lawrence chose to leave United at the end of last season in search of a new challenge after a period of real success within the club's academy.",
      "United's under-18s won three trophies during the 2023/24 season as Lawrence guided the young Reds to both the regional and national Premier League titles as well as the Premier League Cup.",
      "His departure from United was unrelated to the club-wide redundancies towards the end of last season and he simply wanted to take the next step in his career.",
      "As such, he will now make the step up to managing at under-21 level on Tyneside.",
      "\"It's a real privilege to join Newcastle United and to lead the Under-21s squad at such an exciting time for the Academy,\" Lawrence said after his appointment was confirmed.",
      "\"I've always believed in creating environments where young players can grow - not just as footballers, but as people - and that is something the Academy does very well.",
      "\"The club has a clear vision for development, and I'm looking forward to working with the staff and players to help each individual take the next step in their journey.\"",
      "Newcastle's Academy Director Steve Harper added: \"We are delighted to welcome Adam to Newcastle United as new Under-21s Lead Coach.",
      "\"We have carried out a thorough recruitment process to ensure we find the right person to nurture and develop our young players, and in Adam, we have an outstanding young coach joining the club.",

      "With strength in depth at the back available, Amorim is likely to rotate his back-three, meaning Tyler Fredricson, Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven could all start. Maguire came off the bench against both Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu were tasked with occupying the two wing-back berths at Craven Cottage, meaning Amorim could make changes out wide. However, Amad's withdrawal after 52 minutes at the weekend means he could keep his spot in the XI. As a result, Diogo Dalot could occupy the left wing-back berth at Dorgu's expense.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has dropped a team news hint ahead of Manchester United's clash against Grimsby Town. The League Two outfit will host Ruben Amorim's side at Blundell Park on Wednesday night as they each look to progress into the third round of the Carabao Cup.",
      "At the weekend, Grimsby came from behind to salvage a 1-1 draw against Accrington Stanley as they held onto a promotion play-off place. Meanwhile, United threw away a one-goal lead at Craven Cottage, with Emile Smith Rowe netting an equaliser in the second half.",
      "Despite a winless start to the season, the Reds will fancy their chances against David Artell's side. However, Grimsby will be determined to pile on the misery, with Amorim under pressure to deliver a piece of silverware.",
      "Nevertheless, Mbeumo has posted a pre-match graphic preview of the fixture to his Instagram story. Historically, this suggests that the 26-year-old forward, whom United recently signed from Brentford for £71m, will be involved in some capacity.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Casemiro and Patrick Dorgu have also done the same, hinting that they too will start against Grimsby. While Benjamin Sesko and Kobbie Mainoo haven't posted on social media ahead of the clash, Amorim has suggested that the duo could finally start.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of the game, the United boss confirmed that he'll be making numerous changes to the starting lineup. Amorim said: \"Yes. Yes, we have three games this week, we have quality players, and we need to do rotation to try to win every game.\"",
      "On Ramsus Hojlund, who's yet to feature this season, Amorim said: \"All the players are available. Then we will make the choice to get the best starting XI to win every game.\"",
      "At the weekend, the United boss heaped praise on Sesko, who's made two appearances off the bench since joining from RB Leipzig for £73.7m. After the Fulham clash, Amorim said: \"I think he needs time.",
      "\"It's not easy sometimes when you are on the bench and you get into the game and the game is really fast. I think he is understanding that the game is faster than the Bundesliga.",
      "\"But he's fighting. He had some good connections with his team-mates. I felt that when he was on the pitch, he wasn’t on in our best moment.",
      "\"That can change the way you see a player. I am very happy as you can see his effort. We need to help him, we need to be in a better moment to help him.”",
      "Amorim will be relying on the likes of Sesko to step up this evening. A few players have posted pre-match previews of the Grimsby game to their Instagram stories, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will definitely start or, at the very least, play.",

      "Dave Powell is the Chief Business of Football Writer for Reach Plc, covering matters of football finance and governance. A former news and court reporter and ex-sports editor of the Chester Chronicle, Dave's work includes exclusives with the likes of Liverpool owner John W. Henry.",
      "While Manchester United’s summer spending spree may have hinted that the open chequebook policy has returned to Old Trafford, the reality is that it hasn’t, and some painful decisions will need to be made to balance the books.",
      "United, when considering the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules (PSR), are within the limits, and they actually have some room to spend, but that comes with still being a huge cash generating business with global appeal.",
      "United remains one of the world’s biggest sporting teams, not just football teams, sporting teams. They rank alongside the New York Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys, Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Lakers when it comes to size and scale, dwarfing some of those in terms of actual revenue.",
      "The club is still very much big business. They are a global brand that has fans that run deep into the hundreds of millions. That means that there is always cash coming into the business and, even with some fallow years in terms of competitive success, as long as they remain PSR compliant, which they have been, with accounts submitted being for Red Football Limited as opposed to Manchester United Plc, then they can spend. The Red Football Limited accounts strip out some of the costs associated with the Plc, and that has allowed for a little more freedom.",
      "But they are now looking at what happens in January, or next summer, or the summer after. They have stockpiled talent and they cannot afford to do that indefinitely. Players such as Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo face permanent exits at some stage, with Rashford out on loan at Barcelona to save on wages, Garnacho, a Chelsea target, expected to seal a Stamford Bridge move imminently, and Hojlund linked with a loan move to Napoli with a mandatory purchase clause.",
      "Three academy graduates, one player aged 22 who arrived with huge potential and expectation. Garnacho is set to exit for a £50m sum, Rashford, when he does leave, will be closer to £20m, and the club will do well to break even on Hojlund. In the case of Mainoo, a cut-price £45m deal to let him leave has been widely reported as the transfer window approaches its closure. A sum of £115m for three academy graduates who all had extremely high ceilings is not good business.",
      "United may look at it as being £115m in pure profit, which it would be, as academy graduates hold no book value. But when considering they spent £74m on Benjamin Sesko, a player who has huge talent but no Premier League experience, to let three players, two of them just 20 and 21 in Mainoo and Garnacho, with both having international honours, it is the club failing on strategy. These players looked to have been the future of the club for years to come and now cut-priced deals are being mooted.",
      "That is what comes with tumult and a lack of strategy. For all the talk, all the plans to bring about sweeping change, little has arrived, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, arguably the most vocal and visible minority shareholder in all of European football, has already had to take a few public losses, such as the hiring and firing of Dan Ashworth, the mass redundancies and the lack of success in the market and on the field thus far.",
      "The Mainoo arc is a sad one for United if it comes to pass. When fees of £45m are talked about in the modern day Premier League there is barely an eyebrow raised. We’re well beyond that now. It is the same territory as Jacob Ramsey, Noni Madueke and Anthony Elanga, a former Manchester United prodigy who Nottingham Forest flipped for a big profit. Somebody will do it for Mainoo, too.",
      "What 20-year-old midfielders who have started a European Championship final in the past 18 months and who have amassed 50 appearances in the world’s most elite domestic football league and who have potentially another 15 years or more of road ahead at the top level, with demonstrable quality at the top level, are on the market for £45m? It is a failure of the club that they have not been able to aid Mainoo’s journey and development through a period where poor strategy and decisions have led to a lack of competitive success.",
      "It might look good in the short to medium term to make a nice accounting profit on Mainoo, but players of his calibre aren’t the norm through academies. They are leaving tens of millions on the table by moving him on, especially when you consider they spent big on players in that position. The Casemiro signing was always the wrong one to make and a hangover from a previous transfer approach, while Manuel Ugarte’s arrival, while he has a good age profile, has played a part in stymying the development of their own.",
      "Look at Scott McTominay now with Napoli in Serie A. On the Ballon d’Or list, and in a year he has doubled his market value from the £25m he was sold for.",
      "Mainoo was priced at around £70m in January. That still seemed fair market value for the player that he is and the ceiling he has. It is hard to imagine that, if sold for £45m or less, then he won’t follow the same path as McTominay and find his worth increased.",
      "The need to bring back in cash after heavy spending is understandable, but the exits of academy graduates who have shown they can belong should be alarming. The Mainoo stance seems a flawed one, time will see whether or not it will be a failure of the football club.",

      "The Red Devils paid £74m to bring the striker to the club, but his full debut came during an embarrassing loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, heaping even more pressure on the already under-fire Ruben Amorim.",
      "As he pointed out, Amorim was done no favours by his players, with only Harry Maguire putting in what could even come close to being described as a good performance, but a particular problem player was the new summer signing Sesko.",
      "After a weekend display against Fulham that saw Gary Neville describe the Slovenian as “nowhere near”, Sesko did not do much to prove the pundit wrong, registering a Fotmob rating of 5.8, a score only Andrea Onana failed to beat.",
      "As such, the striker has been put in the crosshairs, but while his performance was described as ‘anonymous’, his most egregious offence for many came in the shootout when nine other United players stepped up before him.",
      "The Independent said: ‘Perhaps nothing summed up another spineless showing more than Benjamin Sesko, United’s new £74m central striker, the one tasked with firing the goals to restore United to their former glories, stepping up second-from-last – just before Onana – to take his spot kick.’",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 ‘Looking like a right plonker’ – What the pundits had to say about Ruben Amorim and his tactics board\n👉 Amorim throws ‘completely lost’ Man Utd players under the bus as ‘one team on the pitch’\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘waiting to be sacked’ as Man Utd ‘more Spursy than Spurs’",
      "While the Mail said: ‘It felt like a big night for Sesko too on his full debut after a big-money move from RB Leipzig and two rather subdued appearances off the bench against Arsenal and Fulham. The Slovenian was largely anonymous and then curiously chose to be the last outfield player to step up in the shootout. Not exactly the kind of confidence you expect from a £74m striker.’",
      "The Express were particularly critical, giving him a 1 in their player ratings and saying he was ‘unconvincing’.",
      "‘His first start since a £74million transfer to United. Talk about a rough welcome… Unconvincing is an understatement. Clearly didn’t fancy a penalty, either.’",
      "The Sun said the 6ft 5’ striker was ‘way off it’ and said that if he was given leniency for a slow start in the Premier League, you cannot use the same excuse against a League Two side.",
      "‘I know the talk has been that the Slovenian ace has not been up to pace for the Prem, but he didn’t give a good account of himself against English rough-houses here.",
      "‘He towered over the League Two side’s back-line, but United hardly made use of it.",
      "‘Beat his man on occasion, but his shooting was way off it. Twice easily blocked and another weak one for the keeper to collect.",
      "‘Can’t remember Sesko touching the ball in the second half before he failed to win it for his side when his sitter was sent into row Z from two yards at the death.",
      "‘The £74 million striker went 10th in the shootout. Bizarre.’",
      "‘Out of kilter with his new teammates for most of the evening but came closest to scoring in the first half. Slotted in his penalty.’",
      "The Guardian though said even the sight of Sesko shooting was a reminder that United were allowed to attack.",

      "The Red Devils have made a poor start to the new season with Ruben Amorim’s side taking just one point from their opening two matches against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Man Utd were also humiliated in the League Cup on Wednesday evening with League Two Grimsby beating them on penalties after the Red Devils came from two goals down.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has often been the bright light for Man Utd, despite their struggles, but he is often criticised for his body language and moaning.",
      "Against Fulham at the weekend, Fernandes criticised referee Chris Kavanagh following his missed spot-kick after the official bumped into the Man Utd captain as he stepped back from positioning the ball on the penalty spot.",
      "Fernandes revealed after the match that he was “upset” as the incident had disrupted his penalty-taking routine but former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott has labelled the Man Utd midfielder a “child”.",
      "READ: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Hojlund, Sancho, Antony awful, but Mourinho buy bottom",
      "Walcott said on It’s Called Soccer!: “I look at it like this, it’s a child’s response. Because you’re still trying to teach their mind of how to deal with situations – we’re talking about a child.",
      "“It was a natural child reaction which you would expect and you expect them to keep going on. You know what it’s like with you kids, something happens and they want to keep on going on and you’re trying to manage the situation.",
      "“But he’s a professional athlete who’s the captain of Manchester United football club, he needs to be stronger and blank everything out because you’re playing for the biggest club in the world right now, and if that affects him, the referee bumping him, then they’ve got big, serious issues already.”",
      "Walcott continued: “Get him off penalty duties, get him off the captain’s armband perhaps? Because, for me, if that was another player, you think [Cristiano] Ronaldo is going to? [react the same way] absolutely no chance, do you think Odegaard at Arsenal? [would react the same way] absolutely no chance. Bruno Fernandes’ reaction has really surprised me but it’s got us talking about that instead of the result.”",
      "When asked about the incident, Fernandes said: “Yeah I was upset. [Like] every penalty taker, you have your own routine and things that you do.",
      "“It upset me because the referee didn’t apologise and that was what triggered me in the moment but that’s not the excuse to miss a penalty. I just had a very bad hit of the ball, I took my foot too under the ball and that’s why it went over the bar.”",
      "A report on Wednesday revealed that Fernandes is now ‘open’ to leaving Man Utd at the end of the season as he doesn’t want anything to interrupt his chances of playing in the World Cup with Portugal.",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.9bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",

      "20) 🔽 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million. It went quiet as the Londoners focused on Ebere Eze, and now City have said there’s no chance Savinho leaves, which also means they won’t be signing Real Madrid’s Rodrygo.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",

Leeds have supposedly made an ‘ambitious approach’ (not half), but Mainoo wants to be playing Champions League football. Newcastle can offer that, along with an immediate spot in the team as their No.9 as things stand, and have ‘made contact’ with Manchester United over the conditions of the deal.",

City are likely to encourage his departure given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay and hasn’t agreed terms with Gala despite a £15m bid being accepted last week. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Conor Gallagher – Atletico Madrid to Crystal Palace\nGallagher is reportedly open to a return to the Premier League, with the club he spent 2022/23 on loan at interested. It would be a loan deal but it all hinges on Atletico’s wishes.",
      "",
      "14) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",

      "13) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",

      "12) 🆕 Xavi Simons – Leipzig to Tottenham\nAhh, here we go. Somehow, the most realistic of every attacking midfielder target for Spurs, who are getting quite desperate as the transfer deadline approaches. While Chelsea are trying to sign Alejandro Garnacho, Thomas Frank’s side can swoop in for Simons and complete something of a hijack of their own. The player reportedly prefers Chelsea but might just settle on playing Champions League football in north London. How long until Harvey Elliott is linked?",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first and while Spurs are ‘planning a hijack’, that’ll probably fail.",

Will some hijacking history hilariously repeat itself after the Ebere Eze debacle? That would be quite something and is looking likely with personal terms reached, though the Gunners have been ‘sent a firm message’ as Leverkusen are not open to a loan with buy obligation.",

      "9) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar amid conflicting reports on whether he would serve as a replacement for the Swede or Callum Wilson. Either way, Newcastle’s desperation is showing as a third ‘offer’ worth £60m is set to be submitted after their £55m bid was rejected on Tuesday. While Wolves are standing firm, the Magpies are getting desperate. And something tells us they’ll eventually get this one over the line.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to AC Milan\nThis could be what gets Simons over the line for the Blues. Milan have been linked with hundreds of forwards this summer, so we’re reluctant to jump the gun. It does look promising, though. Knowing Italian teams, it could be a loan for Nkunku, just as it was for Joao Felix when he moved to San Siro.",
      "",
      "7) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, which they appear set to do with a £140m bid ‘ready’.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",

      "6) Jakub Kiwior – Arsenal to Porto\nThis will open the door for Hincapie’s move to Arsenal, whose woeful ability to sell players will sting them again here. Kiwior has proven himself as a top player, especially against Real Madrid in the Champions League, but it looks like the Gunners will pretty much break even with a £23m sale.",

      "5) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Bayern Munich \nNot another one! Jackson is the latest striker that Newcastle United could miss out on, with Chelsea in agreement with Bayern Munich over a loan deal for their unwanted forward.",
      "",
      "4) Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnarumma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",
      "",
      "3) Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal, but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Napoli, meanwhile, have had a breakthrough, with Fabrizio Romano saying a deal is at the ‘final stages’ for Romelu Lukaku’s replacement after former team-mate Scott McTominay got on the blower…",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThis one is almost agreed. United initially wanted an unrealistic £60m, but Chelsea’s proposal is worth £35m, rising to £40m. There might be little choice but to accept with United desperate for all kinds of reasons.",

Who then fired their manager. Nothing more needs to be said, really.",

I really can’t fathom how he had any success in Portugal – I guess he must just have had by far the best players in the league, which makes sense since Arsenal have just spent quite a lot of money on their star striker.",
      "To call it disjointed would be inaccurate as it implies that the system ever had joints in the first place. The one idea in place is to try to make progress down the wings, which is easily countered by the opposition moving an extra player out there. This happened over and over again against Fulham, in another absolutely awful performance. United then try to move the ball to the centre of the pitch, which is always, relatively speaking, deserted. The opposition intercept, break, very easily get to United’s area, and the three-man defence make a block or a tackle and look flustered. Often a corner is conceded, which leads to a guaranteed goal thanks to Onanism or Badidea being born with their hands on back to front.",
      "Surely – surely? – tonight’s result will alert Big Jim the Business Genius/Mechanical Asset Stripper to the fact that Amoron is a terrible, terrible manager. A manager who is either aware that his system isn’t working and too stubborn to change his approach, or who somehow hasn’t realised that his system doesn’t work. Either way, he has to go. At this stage I don’t think I’ve disliked anyone in football as much as I dislike Amoron at the moment. Even Sergio Ramos, for goodness’ sake! Steven Gerrard! Maybe not Steven Gerrard actually. But it’s close.",
      "With the new (long overdue) training ground, and (in theory) exciting new players in the squad, there’s scope for positivity at the club. It won’t happen with the joyless, brainless, directionless, and wildly unsuccessful football played under the current manager. If United can somehow persuade Oliver Glasner or Andoni Iraola to join, I’ll be absolutely delighted. The idea of targeting proven Premier League players in Cunha and Mbuemo (penalty miss aside) is a good one – the club needs to follow suit with the manager.",
      "To pre-empt opposition fans: there’s a reasonable chance that even with a new manager, all the old failings will continue. Of course that’s true. But there’s nothing to be gained sticking with a proven failure, particularly one who keeps alienating promising young players. Like the proverbial stopped clock, even the United board will get it right eventually, and we might see some nice football again. (that’s the level I’m hoping for, rather than winning anything…!)\nDan, Worthing",

      "Before this match, fellow United fans said to me that talk of sacking Amorim is laughable, that the modern fan base would have sacked Sir Alex before he saved his tenure with a 3rd round 1-0 win over Forest in 1990 after finishing the previous season in 13th.",
      "Does that still apply after an abject loss against a much weaker team?",
      "Even now he’s blaming the players rather than taking any responsibility, after being caught hiding in the dugout, fiddling with a tactics board while he desperately threw everyone of his favourites on. Against League 2 Grimsby.",

      "…Give us 15th and I will end the MUFC season today. 365 days of only training may help this team. I highly rate Amorim, and want him to succeed, but this is just abysmal. 24% win rate has no excuses. There are no excuses left. 10 days into the season and it’s all over. Nothing to play for in the league. Will be lucky to beat 2 teams in the FA Cup, what is the point of Manchester United & Amorim? This is worse than Frank De Boar at Palace, Gerrard at Villa, Hodgson at Liverpool etc. I don’t know where we go from here.",
      "During my first 10 years of watching football (2000’s) I always used to wonder what the fans of relegation battling teams or mid table teams feel during the season when there is nothing to play for. Now I know, and honestly it aint that bad. Praying for 1 win a month has its own charm when you actually get that win between 8-10 draws and losses. You still get that endorphin and adrenaline hit. So in a way thank you Manchester United for helping me learn and experience new things, such as how to be a fan of a club that will 100% be battling relegation and have nothing to play for. Widening my horizons and learning more and more about football and its fans.",
      "Thoughts & prayers,\nAman",
      "",
      "…Manchester United’s decision to appoint Ruben Amorim was initially seen as a bold move, with hopes that his tactical philosophy and fresh ideas could spark a revival at Old Trafford. However, as weeks turn into months, the optimism has quickly faded. The reality is clear – Amorim has failed to make the impact expected of a Manchester United manager, and the club risks further decline if decisive action is not taken soon.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with Amorim’s tenure is his inability to adapt his tactics to the Premier League. His insistence on deploying the 3-4-2-1 formation has been widely criticized for being rigid and unsuitable for the squad at his disposal. Despite having talented attacking players, the system often leaves United looking predictable, disjointed, and lacking creativity in the final third. Instead of enhancing the team’s strengths, Amorim’s setup appears to stifle them.",
      "The performances on the pitch tell a worrying story. United’s defensive frailties remain unsolved, the midfield lacks balance, and the attack continues to be inconsistent. More alarmingly, the overall quality of play has regressed compared to his predecessor, Erik ten Hag. While supporters hoped for progress, what they have witnessed instead is stagnation, if not outright decline.",
      "Amorim has also been described as stubborn and unwilling to compromise. His reluctance to adjust his approach – even when results and performances demand it – raises serious doubts about his suitability to lead a club of Manchester United’s stature. The Premier League demands flexibility, adaptability, and the courage to make tough decisions. At the moment, Amorim appears to lack those qualities.",
      "Manchester United is at a crossroads. Continuing under Amorim risks wasting another season, further damaging the club’s reputation, and potentially losing the faith of both players and fans. The longer the hierarchy delays, the harder it will be to repair the damage. A proactive decision to part ways with Amorim could provide United with the opportunity to reset before it is too late.",
      "Manchester United is a club built on ambition, resilience, and high standards. Unfortunately, Ruben Amorim has not lived up to those expectations. To safeguard the club’s future and restore its competitiveness, the leadership must make the difficult but necessary choice: part ways with Ruben Amorim before the situation worsens beyond repair.\nBiswardi Hasbi",
      "",
      "……A penny (a pound even) for the thoughts of Mustafa in these dark times.",
      "I thought his email about a United title challenge was hopeful at best but I didn’t want to pile on cos what’s the point of following a club if you can’t be hopeful at the very least. Seeing those dreams dashed in humiliating fashion 2 weeks into a new season is quite sad.",
      "Amorim is getting away with murder here. I still see people making excuses for him and I can’t believe it. This United team is sh*te but it’s nowhere near this bad. He’s doing his absolute best to hide their strengths and exacerbate their weaknesses. That’s the opposite of what any manager should be doing. The worst thing is that he’s gonna get fired and leave with a huge payday while a lot of people lost their jobs so Big Jim could scrape up some money to buy some players.",
      "As a rival, I should be enjoying this downfall but it’s getting closer to pity for me and I hate it. I want them to be rubbish but not this rubbish. I really don’t want to feel this much sympathy for their fans.\nAbdulazeez, Bristol",

      "Arsenal walking away from the Sesko deal should have been a red flag for Man Utd.",
      "One thing Berta and Arteta have done this season that requires huge applause is signing players with elite mentality and who love the club Arsenal. I’ll be honest, I was one of those who preferred Sesko to Gyokeres but after reading details of the transfers, I knew we had made the right choice. Arteta said one video call with Gyokeres convinced him. He didn’t care. He was convinced he would be the main man regardless of Havertz, Jesus and whoever Arsenal signs. He knew how hard of a step up it would be.",
      "Look at Eze. Man hasn’t stopped smiling since Saturday. Elite mentality. Guaranteed starter at Spurs but knew what he would bring to Arsenal. Look at Hincapie (not done yet but close). Who in their right mind joins a team that has the best CB partnership in the world. You won’t play. Doesn’t care. Wants only Arsenal. These are players who would bleed for the badge. In Arteta’s words, players who love the club through and through.",
      "Compare that to Man Utd. Driving away academy players. Players who understand what it means to play for Man Utd. Rashford, Garnacho, McTominay, now Mainoo. Signing players like Sesko who was just bullied by division 4 defenders. Looks mentally defeated and it’s only their 3rd game of the season. It showed when he refused to push for a move to Arsenal and it shows now on the pitch. Absolutely embarrassing. Man Utd don’t have players who would leave it all on the pitch. A sad decline but a hilarious end.\nDamola AFC Berlin Germany",
      "",
      "Andre Onana, if further proof were needed after last night’s shambles, is simply not good enough for a club with Man Utd’s targets. Neither is Bayindir at the stage of his development. One of the best in the world in that position is clearly not wanted at PSG and itchy for a move. How has this not already been resolved from both sides?",
      "Have Utd and Sir Jimmy, having invested a large amount in reinforcements, finally decided that’s enough money spent for now? Do they not now believe, after three games, that Amorim deserves further backing? Is the lack of CL football an absolute brick wall? City will possibly move Ederson on, sign Donnarumma unchallenged, he’ll make some outstanding, game-winning saves over the season and the fans on the quiet side of Manchester will bemoan City’s habit of buying all the best players and how unfair it all is.",
      "It is my belief that Donnarumma in goal from the first game of the season would see Utd on four points in the league, level with Arsenal, rather than the one that they currently have. Is it the answer to all of the problems at Old Trafford? Certainly not, but like Arsenal and their blindness to the striker issue until this Summer, it’s fixing the most prominent and obvious one.",
      "Also, while I’m here: Sesko taking the very last penalty of the outfield rotation last night was a disgrace. £75m of actual goal-scorer and he either hides or was not trusted by whomever decided the order of the takers. Really instills confidence, eh?\nMonsieur Monkey. Still in the sand",
      "",
      "Laughing aside, I feel like I just a little epiphany around Man Utd.",
      "Liverpool at the start of the Premier League got left behind. They failed to commercialise and made a Souness-sized mistake which ultimately set them back a long way.",
      "Fergie left Man Utd right at the start of the data revolution and I suspect nobody else at the club had given much thought to why they’d been winning for 20 straight years or how to maintain their advantage. They also filled the gap with Moyes who was a bit of a dinosaur and basically told them to cross it a lot instead of trying to actually be good at football.",
      "I’ve heard it said multiple times that their data team is considered one of the worst of the big 6 and I suspect clubs like Brighton are way ahead of them judging by how many brilliant signings they keep making. Maybe Ratcliffe will make the investment to catch up but how long will that take given all the other clubs aren’t standing still. Or will they actually have to try and find an entirely new edge if they’re ever to close the gap and who at Man Utd has the brilliance to do that?\nMinty, LFC",

      "Kobbie Mainoo struck in his culture war with Ruben Amorim, even if Manchester United seem intent on backing a struggling manager and his incompatible system.",
      "The League Cup second round is over, the weird draw for the third round has been made and the majority of players brought in can be expected to rotate back out again when the Premier League returns at the weekend.",
      "But some stated their case to keep their place by taking that Carabao chance. Others completely messed up and that is on them.",
      "",
      "From a second-minute overhead kick onwards, there was never a sense that Reed was going to let his first appearance of the season – and first start since February – go by without incident.",
      "The midfielder did not start a single Premier League game in 2024/25 due to injury and form but is still trusted by Marco Silva and showed why across 90 quietly efficient minutes.",
      "A clever corner to set up Raul Jimenez’s goal in probably the most secure midfield partnership imaginable alongside Tom Cairney was just reward, although it inevitably did not stop Silva pleading for new signings once more after the game.",
      "They are stuck in a difficult transfer spot.",
      "",
      "There is an inherent irony in the youngest manager in Premier League history not wanting to rush through the development of an inexperienced player.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler is not wrong to take his time with the pair of teenage Greek strikers bestowed upon him for £50m or so this year, but the longer their Premier League goal problems continue the more glaring that dichotomy will become.",
      "“There are different demands in a Premier League game than the game today,” he pointed out after Tzimas’ two goals helped dispatch Oxford in a 6-0 thrashing.",
      "“He came into a game where it was already 3-0 so it’s not the intensity you can expect in a Premier League game,” Hurzeler added.",
      "But Tzimas, a £20.8m January signing who spent the rest of the season on loan at Nuremberg, is “closer” to a proper first-team breakthrough, even if Hurzeler will not budge from taking things “step by step”.",
      "",
      "Perhaps Manchester United should go all 2000 FA Cup and withdraw from the League Cup the next time they’re consigned to the second round, even if that means facing the ire of Caprice, Darren Day and Falklands hero Simon Weston.",
      "It’s clearly more trouble than it’s worth, with managers “getting sacked in the morning” and all players involved being tainted to the point of either never featuring again or immediately sold.",
      "Mainoo tried his utmost to keep the Grimsby stink off him and in truth his performance was nothing close to special. The England international was competent but in this curious ongoing culture war with the entirely inept Ruben Amorim, that was enough to strike another blow.",
      "The assist for Bryan Mbeumo’s goal was good and his penalty among the many converted, but Amorim’s bizarre stance on the future of a gifted Manchester United academy product – and the club’s inexplicable decision to back a drowning manager and his incompatible system over said player – meant the result was a personal win for Mainoo in any case.",
      "MORE ON MISERABLE MANCHESTER UNITED\n👉 Amorim and Man Utd reach sack-worthy new nadir as Sesko shrinks in shocking Grimsby defeat\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘waiting to be sacked’ as Man Utd ‘more Spursy than Spurs’\n👉 Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Hojlund, Sancho, Antony awful, but Mourinho buy bottom",

      "There might well have been designs on sending Armstrong out for a second loan after the success of his half-season spell at Derby. And having taken to the Championship so seamlessly at 18, his performance against League One opposition perhaps should not surprise.",
      "But there is reason to believe that Armstrong is better off being kept on Merseyside and nurtured instead of being sent elsewhere.",
      "Everton have depth in midfield but not so much as to completely stifle a promising teenager’s opportunities. A cup run – although such a thing is never guaranteed for the Toffees – and controlled drip-feed of Premier League minutes could be more beneficial than another few months elsewhere.",
      "And the level of technical quality in that squad could see him thrive. Only Dwight McNeil has more assists for Everton since the start of last season than Armstrong, whose three have come in 273 minutes.",
      "",
      "The late strike partnership of Jorgen Strand Larsen and Sasa Kalajdzic could either feed generations or cost an increasingly panicky Newcastle a small fortune, but any big lad is nothing without the right service.",
      "Tchatchoua provided it more effectively than anyone in his 20 minutes on the Molineux pitch. A sublime touch out of the sky preceded Strand Larsen’s first and the cross for the second to complete the comeback was stunning.",
      "It might seem a little rudimentary to run really fast and put the ball in the box but it is an approach worth trying for Wolves, who remain without a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "One of their genuinely impressive number of £10m-£20m signings could well provide a solution and Tchatchoua guaranteed that his opportunity will come soon.",
      "",
      "It could be suggested that Graham Potter has a couple of questions more pressing than picking which double-barrelled right-back he prefers in any given week. When, for example, should he kick off his out-of-work podcast rounds with some High Performance across from Jake Humphrey?",
      "But it might be time to try something different if indeed he is afforded the chance. Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s performance against Chelsea basically demanded it.",
      "Walker-Peters would have had to excavate to the centre of the Earth to retrieve the bar set by that display and being absolutely fine – lovely assist, mind – even in defeat was a considerable improvement.",
      "",
      "It is bizarre to think of Onyeka as the first signing Brentford made upon securing Premier League promotion, such have been his struggles in making a wider impact in west London.",
      "The midfielder started almost as many games on loan to Augsburg last season (33) as he has in the other three years spent waiting at a bus stop in Hounslow (38).",
      "But the fresh start for everyone under Keith Andrews stirred Onyeka into action with a fine showing and assist against Bournemouth. Frank the Tank’s first appearance for Brentford since last August at the same stage of the Carabao was productive.",
      "Hakon Valdimarsson and Fabio Carvalho were among those to stake their claims too, but Onyeka’s case was the most compelling.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola “liked his character” and felt Soler was “one of the positives we can take today”.",
      "The Bournemouth manager also highlighted the additional threat the left-back managed, saying “it was not an easy game at the end, with Dango being fresh in the last minutes” while avoiding any and all temptation to refer to his former forward as unchained, so fair play.",
      "Soler was accomplished enough in only his sixth appearance for the club since joining in January. It will do him no harm to sit under the Adrien Truffert learning tree at left-back.",
      "",
      "The local media had Tchaouna down as ‘Burnley’s bright spark’ in their player ratings and it would be foolish to argue.",
      "A summer signing from Lazio, the forward has made substitute cameos in both the club’s first two games of the season but a shuffle of the pack from Scott Parker should see Tchaouna given a start soon.",
      "He will be one of many in claret positively giddy at the chance to play Manchester United in their current guise this weekend.",
      "",
      "Sunderland quite cleverly buried their defeat to lower-league opposition in a solid midweek for Carabao upsets, exiting the competition at the earliest possible round for the third season in succession.",
      "Combined with the defeat to Burnley, it might leave Regis Le Bris considering a permanent rejig of his promoted pack, which could in turn grant one of Chelsea’s great many undesirables a shop window in which to prove his worth.",
      "It has left Guiu with a fearsome record of a goal every 53.7 minutes in the League Cup and Conference League and knowing Chelsea they can probably spin £20m or so out of that next summer.",
      "",
      "After his match-winning penalty against Everton, Daniel Farke said Nmecha had “paid everything back – but we didn’t pay for him!”.",
      "The manager also admitted he almost intervened to prevent the German from taking it as he “he needed more touches” having only just come on.",
      "Considering the quality of spot kicks taken without Nmecha in the shoot-out defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, Farke might wish he had stepped in to stop any or all of Joel Piroe, Dominic Calvert-Lewin or Sean Longstaff.",
      "Even during the game it was Nmecha who looked more natural and comfortable leading the line with some solid touches and hold-up play.",
      "No-one can emerge from such a demoralising evening with credit, but Nmecha was one of the few who couldn’t really be tarred with much blame either.",
      "Only Andre Onana was rated lower than the £74m signing who waited until the very end to take his penalty in the shootout.",
      "The sight of Ruben Amorim fiddling with a tactics board as his side lose to League Two opposition will be haunting Man Utd fans’ nightmares for years.",
      "Newcastle United are planning a third bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen, while Liverpool mull over a British record offer for Alexander Isak.",
      "Manchester United losing to Grimsby has prompted all manner of responses, but most want Ruben Amorim out of the club.",
      "Manchester United have lost to Grimsby on penalties and it was so hilarious that we had to rush out an extra Mailbox.",
      "As Amorim rocked from side to side on the bench as Man Utd lost a penalty shootout to Grimsby Town he must have wondered if this was his rock bottom. ..."

      "Anyway, the number in brackets next to each player is where they ranked when this list was first compiled in April 2022, which included 45 signings at the time. Any players signed since then have the number from when they were added. Enjoy the drivel.",

      "The Brazilian has been a catastrophic signing and Man Utd will be lucky to get £15m for him if he is put up for sale…is what we did say before an amazing loan spell at Real Betis. With little time left in the summer window, he’ll probably end up leaving for around £25m.",
      "",
      "After signing Benjamin Sesko, United have frozen Hojlund out against his will. We feel sorry for him, but scoring four goals in 32 matches last season after costing over £60m is unacceptable. Watch him score 20 goals in Serie A this season.",
      "",
      "Joining off the back of a man-of-the-match performance in a Champions League final, Di Maria flopped at Old Trafford. The only saving grace from his stint in Manchester is that the club recouped £56.7m when he was sold to PSG less than a year after arriving.",
      "",
      "Wearing the No. 7 shirt has become something of a curse since Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2009; even for the Portuguese himself.",

      "",
      "Oh my, this has been a shambolic signing. We thought Onana was a serious upgrade on David de Gea, but he’s been a disastrous downgrade. That says a lot as well, because De Gea was awfully error-prone in his last season at Old Trafford.",
      "Onana has made some catastrophic errors for United, and a big reason for his signing was his ball-playing ability, which we’re still waiting to see. He’s one of the players we can understand Amorim freezing out",

      "It’s Nottingham Forest so of course one of the few unbeaten Premier League managers this season could get sacked. He should think himself very unlucky to be ahead of Graham Potter and Ruben Amorim.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

      "It is still very early days but really not much more Thomas Frank could have done. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’d get on operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. Remarkably, he appears to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",

      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",

      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, and it really might just be that West Ham are that bad.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Losing late in the Carabao Cup certainly hasn’t helped.",

There was a moment in the second half where there was a break in play and the Utd players all got a drink.

      "As Ruben Amorim rocked from side to side on the bench during a penalty shootout at Blundell Park he must have been wondering whether this was his rock bottom. But there’s always a Manchester United nadir that’s yet to come under his cursed leadership, and it duly arrived in defeat to League Two Grimsby Town after a full 18 minutes of cowering introspection from a manager who should now realise that he’s the problem.",
      "The general consensus at F365 over the summer was that we actually quite wanted Manchester United to do well this season. Mainly because of the thankless task of writing about game after game in which players unsuited to Ruben Amorim’s system failed to make the necessary adaptations. The strikers didn’t score goals, they didn’t create enough chances, the midfield left them horribly exposed, etc. etc.",
      "And it got to a point where it was pretty clear that no matter the depths plumbed by the worst Manchester United team in living memory, Amorim would not be sacked, particularly with the potential for the Europa League trophy and ensuing Champions League football offering end-of-term sprinkles to decorate the turd that was the Portuguese manager’s debut season.",
      "We weren’t allowed to forget that Amorim didn’t want to arrive mid-season and was pushed to make the move in a ‘now or never’ ultimatum from CEO Omar Berrada. He wanted a pre-season to embed his ideas, get some of ‘his players’ through the door and start afresh. We wonder what his excuse is now after a game which has comprehensively revived our belief in Manchester United finding new ways for us to enjoy them.",
      "MAILBOX: Ruben Amorim ‘waiting to be sacked’ as Man Utd ‘more Spursy than Spurs’",
      "We thoroughly look forward to remaining Amorim advocates laying the blame solely at Andre Onana’s door. At fault for both goals – allowing the first to squeeze under his body and coming to flap at a cross for the second – it was a performance to leave absolutely no doubt over the requirement for a new goalkeeper this summer even before his breadstick wrists cost United in the shootout.",
      "But previous reports have suggested that doubts over that need have come from Amorim, whose off-season declaration of ‘trust’ in Onana was evidently misplaced on the basis of last season, while his claim only last week that he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” points to either a hugely worrying lack of knowledge as to what it takes to be a Manchester United No.1 or direction from the hierarchy to temper expectations over the club’s wherewithal to sign a replacement.",
      "And in any case, unless either Senne Lammens or Gianluigi Donnarumma can provide midfield stability while simultaneously holding the ball up and creating chances, United’s problems will not be solved by a new goalkeeper.",
      "We all got a bit carried away after United impressed against Arsenal and none more so than Amorim, who claimed – after losing, lest we forget – that “we proved that we can beat every team in the Premier League.”",
      "Not Fulham though, nor League Two Grimsby Town, who are three divisions and 56 places below Manchester United in the football pyramid and have a squad market value which is approximately four per cent of what their visitors paid for their new striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "His first start for the club won’t have convinced anyone that he’s any sort of upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who might just have scored had he had Sesko’s chance to score in stoppage time from four yards out and probably wouldn’t have been the last outfield player to take a penalty in the shootout. What was all that about? Not very Manchester United, is it now.",
      "And after Bryan Mbeumo came off the bench at half-time to join him and Matheus Cunha to complete the summer signing forward triumvirate, what was a burgeoning hope that Amorim may just have cobbled together a means to create and score enough goals for United is fading fast.",
      "Mbeumo opened his account with a fine probing dribble and clever finish into the far corner but Cunha missed his penalty to ensure United’s £74m shrinking violet of a No.9 had to take his before Mbeumo missed the crucial one. You really can write it.",
      "The problem in the minds of many is in midfield. Manuel Ugarte again staked his claim in a keenly contested battle to be the worst of all midfield signings made in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era before being hooked at half-time for Bruno Fernandes, which granted us all an ill-fated look at the captain and wantaway Kobbie Mainoo together in the double pivot.",
      "United did improve, but that felt as much to do with an inevitable increase in pressure from a Premier League side over a tiring League Two minnow as evidence of Mainoo-Fernandes being a viable future partnership. Amorim won’t have been convinced the uptick in creativity that did come was significant enough for him to make peace with the soft centre he’s worried about in Premier League games to come.",
      "But maybe it won’t matter for much longer what Amorim thinks. Maybe Mainoo just needs to wait out Amorim, because the image of him with head bowed on the bench as his ragtag bunch of expensively signed footballers got dumped out of a cup competition they’re only playing in at this point because he did such a terrible job last season will be a hard one to shake for the players, the fans and the owners, who may as well pull the trigger now, because if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Amorim’s Manchester United, there’s always a new nadir.",

      "Chelsea are ‘close to agreeing terms’ with Manchester United over a £40m deal for Alejandro Garnacho in what sounds like quite the deal for the Blues.",
      "United wanted £50m for the Argentinian, but as reported by The Telegraph, Ruben Amorim announcing to the world that there was no way back for Garnacho at Old Trafford ‘gave negotiations a different dynamic’. After Garnacho insisted it was ‘Chelsea or nothing’, BlueCo needed only to wait out United, and the Red Devils have duly wilted.",
      "We said last week amid reports that United would hold out for their asking price that Chelsea should push for much of that fee to be in add-ons, acting as ‘Pr*ck Protection’ in case Garnacho decided to post a picture of himself wearing the shirt of a rival club on social media or flipped the bird to the club’s fans, but Chelsea will consider £40m a more than fair price even given the potential for Garnacho not to kick on at Stamford Bridge.",
      "There’s a question as to whether Chelsea even need him given the arrival of Jamie Gittens this summer, with Pedro Neto and Joao Pedro also options for Enzo Maresca on the left, while the return of Mykhaylo Mudryk remains a possibility, albeit an uninspiring one.",
      "But as Chelsea have shown so impressively in this transfer window, with 12 player sales almost entirely cancelling out their eight arrivals to leave them with a net spend of almost zero, including three only signed last summer, they’re a club which sees footballers as commodities to be bought and sold, with a somewhat depressing lack of emotion involved in their decisions. Garnacho is simply a market opportunity they couldn’t miss out on.",
      "‘Chelsea have made a number of checks on his character and approach to the job, although the acceptance is that the proof will be in his performance’, according to The Telegraph. But a cut-price deal means Chelsea won’t need any improvement from Garnacho to make a tidy profit.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘At the level of the deal as agreed, there is a realistic market for Garnacho beyond Chelsea should it not work out for him in west London. With only a few exceptions, Chelsea’s business is done with potential trading of the player further down the line should a transfer not work out.’",
      "MORE CHELSEA COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Barcelona set Chelsea ultimatum after Blues ‘formal offer’ as two signing conditions revealed\n👉 Chelsea transfer ‘falls through’ as player ‘fails medical’ ahead of agreed controversial move\n👉 Tottenham told to ‘move quickly and quietly’ to sign long-time Chelsea target",
      "Assuming he doesn’t upset the apple cart as he’s done under Ruben Amorim, and maybe even if he does but Chelsea don’t make such a big deal about it, the same return as last season of ten goals and ten assists will result in plenty of interest next summer.",
      "Noni Madueke got ten goals and five assists last season before Arsenal bought him for £48m. Anthony Elanga’s six goals and 12 assists to prompt Newcastle into his £52m signing. And Chelsea themselves signed Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for £48.5m after his 12 goals and five assists. Garnacho got more goal contributions than any of them and arguably has the highest ceiling.",
      "There’s a decent chance Garnacho will thrive at Chelsea – he’s a big talent who’s desperate to play for them – but the price tag offers a very savvy football club a safety net in a transfer which feels as much like a business transaction as a move for a player they’re convinced will make a big difference on the pitch.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working hard to finalise’ a ‘blockbuster £120m double deal’ amid interest from Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",

      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",

      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "2) Arsenal – £254.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudged Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes. Then came Eberechi Eze for another £60m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "Amorim is destroying talents\nI have had a long and hard thought about what’s happening at United and still can’t fathom Amorim’s decisions, team selection and tactics but, more so his damaging relationships with players. We have lost the services of talented players directly due to his actions albeit he has been in charge for a short period.",
      "First, we lost Rashford, then Garnacho and now Mainoo may be leaving. Great talents and skills lost to United, especially if the cool and collected Kobbie Mainoo leaves.",
      "Instead of playing Fernandes at his competent position of No. 10 and fielding Mainoo in midfield, he continues to play Fernandes in midfield and keep Mainoo on the bench, very ridiculous indeed. This is not impacting on United only, it is also adversely affecting the performance of Bruno Fernandes himself.",
      "Meanwhile, Chico Obi is wasting his skills and talents, not getting even a few playing minutes. Besides, he signed a natural striker, Sesko, and he continues to keep him on the bench. Why? It is completely illogical and, actually, irresponsible that a club signs a needed striker and not play him, leaving him to warm the bench. This is happening despite the fact that only 3 or so clubs scored fewer goals than United last season. No good coach will do that.",
      "Sight should further not be lost of the fact that his utterances are adversely affecting his relationships with the playing body. The issues are exacerbated by his utterly refusal to make changes. All told, Amorim is a problem at United not a solution. I urge him to be flexible enough to identify and implement changes.",
      "Amorim’s greatest problem is his lack of flexibility which has resulted in his adamant refusal to make changes.

      "Can a 3-4-3 work in the Premier League?\nTo butcher a famous quote “I have not come to bury Amorin, nor praise him” because it’s pointless. Firstly, no one of any influence is reading my diatribes (heck I can barely get you folk to read them!) and secondly, I don’t have all the facts. So instead I want to change the approach of the club-specific moaning and ask the collective wisdom of the group, perhaps some of you former players or coaches, … Can the 343 system actually work in the EPL?",

      "2. The high press works right up until you play against elite teams who can either play around you or ping the ball into the gaps. The current Barcelona women’s team is a perfect example of beating the press. Although they lost to Arsenal in the CLF, they played them off the park.",
      "3. Without 2 DMs, there is either huge holes in the center of the park or one of the 3 Defenders needs to step up. Currently none of the MUFC back 3 can either step into that space and run with the ball.",

This week Slot playing Wirtz against Newcastle away is more of the same. It is probably the most physical fixture on the calendar. Also it is a difficult place to play without all the Isak nonsense. Just seems tone deaf.",
      "The whole advantage of having quality depth is to be able to withstand injuries and make small changes to keep a competitive edge. Robertson is still a high quality left back and should be the preferred starter and should have been since matchday 1.",
      "I can’t tell if it is his desire to make this his own team or some other reason, but I’ve not been inspired so far. It is early days but there needs to be some tweaks. Maybe you go three at the back and provide more cover for Konate who looks out of shape in addition to being unfocused. MacAlister coming back will help sure up the midfield, but they won’t win against Arsenal (another emotional game against a title rival) without making some change. Large or small. Great games, but christ almighty I won’t hate a clinical 2-0 win.\nJ",

By all means indicate internally you would like a transfer, (perhaps even submit a transfer request like the good old days?), but still turn up to training and play for the team that is paying you, as per your contract.

      "Whilst Liverpool eventually got their man 6 months later, it shows that the club has no respect for anyone else, much more so than the other top 6 clubs (Spurs & Gibbs-White aside). A lot of Liverpool fans try and sit upon the moral high ground, decrying other teams’ approaches to transfers (e.g. Real Madrid & TAA), but Liverpool have demonstrated the exact same approach to undermining other teams, much more so than other clubs in the Big 6.",
      "As an aside, Monday’s match was another instance of Newcastle disgracefully crossing the line with physicality, only this time VAR rightly stepped in to actually ensure they were punished for once. It should be unbelievable that the spineless worm of a referee clearly didn’t care about player welfare and would have been happy for Gordon to remain on the pitch, but this is PGMOL under Howard Webb’s stewardship, where the referees need to be front and centre instead of the actual football.",

Lads, you’ve won two PL titles in 35 years, two!! Maybe wind it in a bit?

      "Open goal to start. ‘How in anyone’s right mind can Liverpool fans ever be slagged off’ – First game of the season, Semenyo racially abused at Anfield.",
      "1) Newcastle supporters booed every single Liverpool player each time they had the ball, not just Ekitike (looks a wonderful player). You must have been to a hostile away game before; Liverpool have had loads in Europe over the years. Also, Ekitike’s off the ball trip on Tonali forced him to leave the field injured. It was the type of shithousery you’d expect to see when you watch the caveman united vs caveman athletic derby. To confirm, Newcastle are in the Champions League this season.",
      "2 ) Liverpool are a wonderful team and play some great football. Up until Gordon got himself red carded (rightfully so), Newcastle also played some nice football too but couldn’t score. When you go down to ten men, you need to change your tactics somewhat. You slow the game down, you focus on trying to win set pieces, this isn’t something Newcastle have invented, teams have done it forever. In fact, Liverpool tried several times to slow the game down, I think the referee had a word with Kerkez about time wasting over a throw in. Oh, and the change of tactic nearly worked. You are going to be very disappointed if you go to each game expecting every team to try and pass Liverpool off the park.",
      "As for being verbally aggressive, grow up, I certainly didn’t imagine VVD shouting in the face of the referee 3 times in the first 20 minutes or Gravenberch’s scissor tackle from behind on Bruno (most fouled player in the top 5 leagues last season) that he was cautioned for.",
      "3) All Isak is guilty of is not honouring the 6 year contract he signed 3 years ago, well that and faking an injury to avoid a preseason tour, making himself unavailable for games, going to train with his former club and posting content onto social media that damages the reputation of his employer (though I’ll let that slide what with the sportswashing and all). Yes, Liverpool is a bigger club, yes, they can pay him more money and yes, he’ll win more playing for them, but until they offer the money that Newcastle are willing to accept, he should at least act like a professional. Same for Wissa and anyone else in that position.",
      "4) If Newcastle were able to spend the way Man City or Chelsea was able to spend, then like it or not, they would be a superpower in waiting. If you can’t see that, then I suggest you give up football commentary and try to get Duncan and the boys back together for a Blue reunion tour. Maybe team up with Simply Red and call yourself Deep Purple.No doubt about it, the management structure within the club has been a disaster this year, not many Newcastle supporters will disagree with that. Staveley leaving, ill health of Darren Eales, Paul Mitchell stepping down and no obvious succession planning has each played a part. Prior to that, it was all going swimmingly.",
      "Quick responses now …\nUpset by a banner – anyone wearing a Suarez t-shirt?\nGet into them – sang it for years, you aren’t special!\nSnarling aggression – anyone get bitten?\nPlayacting – Salah ever won a penalty?\nLost a game at home – 10 men outplaying the champions, no shame in that.\nPicked up a suspension – A deserved one may I add.\nTreatment room overflowing – Nothing new there.\nAll because Liverpool bid for one of our players – More so because of how he’s acted since. Oh, and many fans will read posts like yours and think, f*** those entitled pigs.\nNegotiation is not a crime – Liverpool bid once, it wasn’t enough, bid again and it might be. One bid does not a negotiation make.",
      "Covered the Wissa thing above. If you’re bidding £110 million for something valued at £150 million it is derisory. If you bid £110 million for something valued at, let’s say £120 million, it isn’t. The Saudi’s don’t need your shed, don’t waste your time listing it.",
      "Again, with the booing – We booed every player (and the refs), whether they were born in the 90s, 00s or 10s (???). Do you want opposing fans to applaud your players when they score, again, grow up. Oh, and that’s some take, stating that the things stopping Newcastle becoming one of the footballing elites (whatever that is) is the fans booing, players being too committed in tackles and diving.",
      "More quick responses…",
      "For the Gravenberch grin – I raise you the Bruno celebration in front of the Gallowgate\nChiesa celebrations – Osula’s beaming smile for the (then) equaliser\nSlot pushing Ngumoha towards the Leazers End – Isaks celebration at Wembley when the tiny Newcastle United slapped down the elite-mega giants-non diving-non booing-definitely didn’t attack the City bus in the champions league-Semenyo abusing-Suarez racism supporting-Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final, to end their 70-year trophy drought (because winning the championship doesn’t count apparently). That is something Liverpool do not get, and they never will.",
      "The chant from the away end ‘hand him over’. That is entitlement. To be fair to Lee, he then did a solid attempt at humour, a Liverpool fan accusing anyone else of having a victim complex is brilliant.",
      "When you’re next at St James’ Park look to your right and you’ll see home fans sitting alongside you, up in the gods. It’s not the best, but ‘how is it even allowed’, Jesus, grow up, victim, entitled.",
      "They could use the £20 million for the ball boys as a down payment on your shed.",

      "Picking it apart point by point would be pretty straightforward, but life’s too short. There were a couple of highlights though:",
      "– Newcastle playing “verbally aggressive” football. Errrr, what?",
      "– “Snarling aggression” and “turning football into a battlefield” sounds very much like what you can expect at Anfield when a stronger team comes to town. If you cross the line, you get what Anthony Gordon got. As per the rules. Nothing to see here.",
      "– City are “sleeping giants”? After one poor season, and one poor result this season? As you smarmily pointed out Lee, it’s August. Maybe heed your own words.",
      "– Accusing other teams of having a victim complex, only to then describe snatching a 100th-minute win against a team who’d been down to 10 for the previous 70 minutes as “poetic justice”? Jesus Christ. How many advantages do you need before you get down off your cross?",
      "To summarise, creating a hostile atmosphere makes a ground an intolerant hell hole unless it’s Anfield, you’re not allowed ruffle Liverpool players by fair means or foul cos diddums, and the league is sewn up because one bad result for anyone else immediately colours a 38 game season.",
      "Kudos to the Liverpool fans recognising that they got out of jail on Monday and crediting Newcastle for what happened on the pitch. Nothing but ridicule for the guff brigade spouting garbage like this, you embarrass the rest.\nKeith Reilly",
      "",
      "We don’t talk about Bruno…\nSo I feel that whenever I played Football Manager back in the day around 11 years ago I used the editor to cheat a bit. That’s my confession, sorry but it feels good to share.",
      "I would find out the wonderkids in internet forums down the line and make sure I got a few bargains in a lower league team at the start to give me a boost. I would DEFINITELY rage quit and even if I had to start a few matches back it was still fulfilling to take a lower league team and bring them up into the Champions League with the squad, wonderkinds, youth development regens and some legends who I would sign just to say I managed (looking at you Barca tiki taka legends)",
      "However I can completely see how that was a fun game and a really enjoyable pasttime. I can’t for the life of me see how Pafos FC (formed 11 years ago) in the Cypriot League have managed to become only the third club in history to qualify for the group stages (or league stage technically) of the Champions League EVER from Cyprus!",

      "But now it’s all over, and we can get to the actual draw and discuss how unfair/biased it all is. However, back then I had chosen Finnish KuPS, who were riding high in their domestic league at the time (and are 2nd, at the time of writing, on GD). They were doing great, and after beating Kairat Almaty in the home leg 2-0, it looked like they were all set to almost be there.",
      "Unfortunately the away tie ended 3-0 to Almaty, with all three goals scored in the 1st half. They went into the break needing just a goal, but ultimately they were awful, registering just 1 shot on target, and gaining 2 corners, in stark contrast to the home tie where they had 5 and 10 respectively.",
      "Maybe it had something to do with the travelling to the outer reaches of … checks map … Kazakhstan, a village 200km from China, and has a Wiki page that hasn’t been updated in 8 years. These are the reasons why I do this every year, guys.",
      "Anyhoo, perhaps that distance played a role in their vanquishing of Celtic last night? Kairat managed to take a 0-0 from Scotland back home, and got another in front of their own fans – evidently 300 Celtic fans made the trip – and took it to penalties.",
      "The Kairat keeper was apparently an emergency stop gap, but it was he, Temirlan Anarbekov, at the age of 21, who brought the riches of Champion’s League to this club. The second Kazakh team to feature.",
      "We all love football – some like to argue about it more so – so I implore you to do this next year. Pick a club, any club, and follow them, and should they get defeated swap over to the victors and do the same.",

      "According to reports, Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on his transfer ‘preference’ as he is ‘deeply frustrated’ at Manchester United.",
      "The England international’s long-term future is in serious doubt as he has dropped in the pecking order at Man Utd.",
      "Mainoo enjoyed a remarkable breakout season in 2023/24 as he emerged as one of the best young footballers in Europe, but he has suffered a major fall from grace over the past year amid his injury issues and a loss of form.",
      "Ruben Amorim is clearly not sold on Mainoo as he has only been a bit-part player since his arrival, with it unclear whether the midfielder can fit into the head coach’s preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "In January, Man Utd opened the door to Mainoo leaving as they looked to sanction pure profit sales to balance the books and he attracted interest from Chelsea, who reportedly would have had to pay £70m to sign him.",
      "Chelsea, unsurprisingly, did not sanction a move for Mainoo at this price, with fresh reports claiming Man Utd have decided to ease their demands.",
      "READ: Mainoo and Garnacho to start, record signing made and Amorim ‘sacked in the morning’ in League Cup omen",
      "There has been new speculation regarding Mainoo in recent days, as he has been an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Earlier this week, respected journalist David Ornstein revealed that Mainoo is open to leaving Man Utd, while The Athletic’s Laurie Whitwell provided more details on Wednesday morning.",
      "Whitwell claims Mainoo is ‘deeply frustrated’ after being snubbed by Amorim at the start of this campaign, with his ‘preference’ being a move to a ‘European team’ amid shock interest from Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.",
      "He has also noted that the Red Devils have ‘considered the prospect of selling Mainoo all summer’ and while it’s internally believed that he has ‘areas to improve’, ‘people at Old Trafford expect him to remain a United player beyond next week’s deadline’.",
      "Despite this, Whitwell has also pointed out that Man Utd have decided to lower their asking price for Mainoo.",
      "‘Mainoo is thought to prefer moving to the continent rather than staying in the Premier League — he explored options in Germany when coming through United’s academy — even though there has been interest from closer to home.",
      "‘When Chelsea enquired about his availability during the January window, Stamford Bridge officials were quoted a £70million asking price. There is a belief United would now accept around £45m, potentially even less as the deadline draws near.’",
      "Newcastle United have made contact with Manchester United over a deal to sign Kobbie Mainoo, Football365 understands.",
      "We are trying to move on from Liverpool, Newcastle and Alexander Isak but there’s still plenty of that. Man Utd first though…",
      "Kobbie Mainoo’s agent briefed that his client was interested in Champions League football, and just a few hours later Real Madrid were interested. Shocker.",
      "Next summer England will – probably – be at the World Cup. But these five players will miss out unless they get themselves some football sharpish.",
      "Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are expected to make a decision on the future of Newcastle-linked midfielder Kobbie Mainoo ‘in the next 48 hours’."

      "Fernandes is currently on a £280k-a-week deal with the Old Trafford club with that set to expire in June 2027, although it can be extended by another 12 months.",
      "They say that the club was caught by surprise by the ‘sudden speculation that Fernandes could leave’ and that the player is ‘highly unlikely’ to depart before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Fernandes said in the summer that he still wants to play football at the “highest level” even if a move to Saudi to join Portuguese team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo, Joao Cancelo and Ruben Neves was an “exciting offer.”",
      "“Manchester United said they didn’t want to sell me,” he told the BBC. “They said if I wanted to go I could, but they didn’t need the money. I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, he was pushing for me not to go.”",

      "Next summer England will – probably – be at the World Cup. But these five players will miss out unless they get themselves some football sharpish.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nThere’s some ambitious/ludicrous talk of Leeds United but we suspect that Mainoo will be eyeing rather more rarefied air than can be found in West Yorkshire. There is an admission – after two Premier League games spent entirely on the bench – that he will have to look outside of Manchester United for some first-team football, particularly after boss Ruben Amorim made it clear that Bruno Fernandes is his competition.",
      "Chelsea have been mentioned among his options but he will surely just find similar roadblocks there, with Tottenham making rather more sense considering their need for more numbers in midfield. Thomas Frank’s system will undoubtedly suit him better than Amorim’s.",
      "Still only 20, it seems extraordinary that Mainoo was far better established with England a year ago; he is yet to play for Thomas Tuchel but if Jordan Henderson can get a recall…",
      "",
      "Conor Gallagher (Atletico Madrid)\nThe former Chelsea midfielder was in Tuchel’s last squad, which perfectly illustrates what a dearth of options England still have in central midfield; we’re only just past the point of adding Kalvin Phillips to these features.",
      "Atletico have had a tricky start to this season and Gallagher doubly so, being hauled off at half-time in the opening game and being benched for the second. There have been links with Crystal Palace and he is said to be ‘open’ to the move. It’s hardly surprising…the last time he went to Palace, he was voted Player of the Year and became an England regular.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nThis was supposed to be the summer that Elliott left Liverpool after a season in which he started just two Premier League matches…after the title had been won. And yet there he still is, coming off the bench for a few minutes against Newcastle after spending the entirety of the Bournemouth game waiting for a chance that never came.",
      "There’s no doubt that Elliott could make the breakthrough to the England senior squad if he was playing regular football, and he could be offered that in the Bundesliga, at Tottenham as an alternative to Eberechi Eze, or at Crystal Palace as a replacement for Eze. Could he be the World Cup bolter we predicted?",
      "",
      "Taylor Harwood-Bellis (Southampton)\nOne game, one goal. He probably needs to leave the middle reaches of the Championship if he wants to add to either tally.",
      "",
      "Joe Gomez (Liverpool)\nJurgen Klopp singlehandedly crowbarred him into England’s Euro 2024 squad with a late flurry of Premier League starts, but Gomez seems unlikely to provoke Arne Slot into the same favour this season. And he is exactly the kind of useful defender that international managers love.",
      "It has to hurt Gomez that Dominik Szoboszlai was picked out of position at right-back for the belter with Newcastle United and if he cannot get a look-in past this version of Ibrahima Konate, then his Liverpool career looks doomed.",
      "The good news for Gomez is that half the Premier League will be desperate for last-minute recruits, and a Gomez playing regular mid-table football might sneak onto that plane.",
      "Only Andre Onana was rated lower than the £74m signing who waited until the very end to take his penalty in the shootout.",
      "The sight of Ruben Amorim fiddling with a tactics board as his side lose to League Two opposition will be haunting Man Utd fans’ nightmares for years.",
      "Newcastle United are planning a third bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen, while Liverpool mull over a British record offer for Alexander Isak.",

      "For the first time in over a decade, Manchester United have been thrown into the second round of the League Cup draw this season.",
      "It presents a clear opportunity for Amorim to record his first win of the season – and just his 17th in 45 matches in charge.",
      "But Manchester United have been here before: with a tactically rigid manager in his first full season; winless in their opening two Premier League games; with days remaining of the transfer window; and facing the ignominy of some early Carabao because of their lack of European football. And it did not go well.",
      "The 4-0 defeat to League One side MK Dons in August 2014 still stands as one of the most embarrassing since Sir Alex Ferguson left, and really beyond that in the club’s entire history.",
      "Van Gaal, serenaded with chants of “you’re getting sacked in the morning” by the home fans at points throughout, was “not shocked” by the manner or measure of defeat.",
      "He also said “it’s very difficult when you start as manager in the Premier League with a home match loss and after that a draw and then lose a cup match, then for the fans it is very difficult to believe, still believe, in the philosophy of Louis van Gaal. But you have to do that, you have to do that, because I am here to build a new team, and a new team is not built in one month.”",
      "Change the name and that is pretty much verbatim what Amorim will say when Jaze Kabia humbles them at Blundell Park on Wednesday evening.",
      "Van Gaal even pointed to the “process” of having to coach players on a three-at-the-back system. Grimsby are through and whoever starts for the visitors on the coast will be sold imminently.",
      "There are some debatably positive omens. It only added to the hilarity and absurdity of the defeat that earlier in the day Manchester United announced the British record capture of Angel Di Maria, who would thankfully instantly solve all these problems by himself.",
      "The “complete fanny” would likely have wilted at Stadium MK at the sight of Dean Lewington, Kyle McFadzean, Darren Potter and an 18-year-old Dele. This lot most certainly did.",
      "",
      "David de Gea\nThe extent of the damage caused to the starting line-up named on that fateful evening will be laid bare in due course, but De Gea was typically immune to it.",
      "The Spaniard was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and the club’s Player of the Year that campaign, adding either or both honour a few times over during the subsequent eight seasons he spent between the sticks.",
      "And even still he was discarded as easily as a free lunch or actual employee when it came to making and articulating an actual decision on his future when his final contract expired.",
      "",
      "Marnick Vermijl\nAn injury crisis thrust Vermijl into the spotlight, two years after his first Manchester United appearance in a League Cup third-round win over Newcastle.",
      "A player his father once said Sir Alex Ferguson predicted “would become a fixture in the Manchester United squad” in fact did not; those 90 chastening minutes which culminated in his mistake to let Benik Afobe in to score a fourth were his last in the shirt.",
      "Marnick left in a permanent move to Sheffield Wednesday the following winter and is currently having Afobe-related nightmares as a 33-year-old at third-tier Belgian club Thes.",
      "",
      "Michael Keane\nWhile he is sometimes lumped in with those the club were wrong to sell, Keane stood precious little chance at Manchester United after a disastrous performance against League One opposition.",
      "“I feel that when you play for United you don’t get too many chances and when you do you’ve got to take them,” he said a few months later. “But the whole team didn’t perform that day – it wasn’t just one or two players. I was gutted for a few days afterwards and I was really disappointed in myself but I was hopeful I’d get another chance. It didn’t happen.”",
      "Perhaps sensing that opportunities would not be forthcoming after his fifth and final game, Keane sought the safe haven offered by Sean Dyche. A loan move to Burnley was completed within the week and made permanent by the winter.",
      "Manchester United did at least land a sizeable portion of his next transfer through a sell-on fee.",
      "",
      "Jonny Evans\nArguably the worst individual performance on a collectively catastrophic evening came from the captain. Evans owned up to his part of the “sloppy mistakes” and could be found on the scene of all four individual crimes.",
      "“Once we had to start chasing the game their superior fitness levels showed, because most of our team hadn’t played in a while,” he added.",
      "Yet Evans endured, sticking around for another season before leaving and frequently being labelled as a player who “should never have been allowed to leave”.",
      "The MK Dons game was not mentioned in his return announcement almost a decade later.",
      "",
      "Reece James\nNot he of Chelsea fame but the Football League journeyman who is currently holed up at Rotherham, left-back James was given his debut in inauspicious circumstances and never played for the club again.",
      "James had scored twice in a pre-season friendly against LA Galaxy, the first game in charge for Louis van Gaal, but “the MK Dons game killed me and I can only fault myself for that”.",
      "",
      "Saidy Janko\nWhen asked to name the four signings David Moyes made at Manchester United, the universal first answer is Marouane Fellaini. Once the realisation hits that he lasted beyond January, the next guess tends to be Juan Mata. And some might even recall the great Guillermo Varela, who started that ludicrous game against Arsenal in 2016.",
      "Janko is the Sporcle trap, shuffling through the same door as Fellaini on deadline day in summer 2013. And his solitary Manchester United career appearance was cut short as the half-time substitute sacrifice.",
      "“Giggsy said I did well and it was a bit unfortunate,” Janko later claimed while confirmed Van Gaal “didn’t speak to me”. But the Dutchman “was not happy with the formation” and “I was the one who had to go off but at least I got a few minutes”.",
      "And to be fair, Manchester United went from 1-0 down at the break to a 4-0 loss without Janko. He was holding it all together.",
      "",
      "Anderson\nFour Premier League titles, a heroic penalty in the Champions League final and a legendary imbalance of absurd ability and non-existent work rate has ensured that Anderson’s final Manchester United start can be consigned deep to the back of the collective conscience.",
      "But the sight of him struggling to keep track of Will Grigg as the closest central defender to the forward in an apparent three-at-the-back formation did sum up the latter part of his career in particular.",
      "Anderson did play again for Manchester United, also summarily failing to impact a goalless draw with Burnley before heading back to Brazil at just 26.",
      "",
      "Shinji Kagawa\nIt seems likely that Kagawa would be mildly grateful for the concussion he suffered in the opening stages of the game, seeing as it left him with no memory of what would transpire.",
      "Manchester United were still holding MK Dons to a respectable goalless draw when he went off for Adnan Januzaj in what was the sad final appearance of an ultimately regretful spell at Old Trafford. Five days after the defeat he was back at Dortmund.",
      "",
      "Nick Powell\nIt is the personal favourite post-Ferguson moment of many: when Manchester United, 2-1 down and needing to beat Wolfsburg to ensure a place in the Champions League knockouts, introduced Powell for Juan Mata around the hour mark.",
      "Van Gaal’s side did draw level shortly thereafter but Wolfsburg immediately hit back to consign them to the Europa League.",
      "It was Powell’s penultimate Manchester United appearance, and first in 16 months since his hour or so against MK Dons. His teammates were justifiably ‘bemused’ and the media was glowing with righteous indignation too.",
      "",
      "Javier Hernandez\nThere is every reason to believe Van Gaal did tell Hernandez, as the Mexican later recounted, that he “only had a 1% chance of playing in my position”. That is entirely on brand with the manager’s methods.",
      "But that “1% chance” did manifest itself as two starts under the Dutchman, who hauled Hernandez off at half-time of a goalless draw on the opening day with Swansea and let him slug it out for all of the MK Dons embarrassment.",
      "Hernandez found himself on loan at Real Madrid the following week and was gone for good within the year.",
      "",
      "Danny Welbeck\nBut Welbeck is most frequently cited as the one who should never have been allowed to get away.",
      "Van Gaal explained that he had “given all the players a chance to convince me of their qualities” but decided to offload Welbeck to Arsenal “because of Falcao but also the youngsters who can fit in”.",
      "Gary Neville, Jose Mourinho and Rio Ferdinand seem to take it in turns questioning why Welbeck was sold every six months and the player himself presumably felt the League Cup second round graveyard shift was an affront too far.",
      "Welbeck never started again, made a cameo in the goalless draw with Burnley days later and joined Arsenal before the window closed.",
      "In a nutshell, expect an uninterested starting line-up featuring Andre Onana, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo to get battered before they are offloaded the following day.",

      "Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, according to reports.",
      "Mainoo has been an unused substitute in the Red Devils’ opening two Premier League matches, sparking debate over his future at the club.",
      "Ruben Amorim has come under intense scrutiny for ignoring the 20-year-old in the defeat to Arsenal and draw at Fulham.",
      "In the Fulham game, the 40-year-old brought on defenders Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven in the closing stages instead of turning to Mainoo.",
      "Having come through the United academy, the England international is a fan favourite at Old Trafford, and supporters are firmly opposed to the idea of him being sold.",
      "United haven’t made a decision on Mainoo’s future but have reportedly been ‘contacted’ by several clubs after it emerged that he is open to a fresh challenge.",
      "There’s plenty of football to be played, however, and two consecutive games on the bench don’t necessarily mean Mainoo is out of Amorim’s plans.",
      "Still, it’s an ominous sign that the Portuguese head coach has continued to prefer a struggling Manuel Ugarte and attacking midfielder Mason Mount in his midfield two.",
      "Amorim’s reason for Mainoo’s lack of minutes is that he’s competing with club captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot.",
      "Fernandes is virtually undroppable, and if Amorim sees it as a straight choice between him and Mainoo, the youngster may feel he has little option but to leave.",
      "A previous report from Daily Mail journalist Chris Wheeler did not name the clubs exploring a move for Mainoo, but did say there are as many as ten teams interested in the ‘frustrated’ star.",
      "Now, a fresh report from Wheeler’s colleague Mike Keegan says the two Madrid giants are keen.",
      "There are apparently ‘a host of Premier League clubs monitoring the situation’, while Atletico and Real Madrid are ‘keeping tabs’.",
      "The two La Liga clubs are ‘interested’ in agreeing a season-long loan for Mainoo, who is ‘open to remaining at United’, though his desire is to play first-team football regularly and is also willing to join a club in the Champions League.",
      "The report adds:",
      "It is thought unlikely that United would sanction a loan switch for a player who they are not actively seeking to sell.",
      "The club currently only have four central midfielders and anything other than a permanent move for Mainoo is not desirable.",
      "Given the season is only two matches old, the player may well have a key part to play at Old Trafford, despite his early absence from the line-up.",
      "He is not thought to fit Amorim’s 3-4-3 system and his absence from the first XI appears to have brought things to a tipping point.",
      "The issue has been exacerbated by the lack of progress in talks over a new contract – with United due to make a call in the next 48 hours, as Daily Mail Sport revealed earlier this week.",
      "READ NEXT: Transfer rumour ranking: Three Man Utd deals close as Arsenal strike Hincapie terms ‘agreement’",

      "Kobbie Mainoo’s agent briefed that his client was interested in Champions League football, and just a few hours later Real Madrid were interested. Shocker.",
      "According to reports, Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on his transfer ‘preference’ as he is ‘deeply frustrated’ at Manchester United.",

      "Ruben Amorim said \"something has to change\" after Manchester United's defeat to Grimsby Town, but that it could not be \"22 players again\".",
      "Man Utd suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Carabao Cup second round to the League Two club, losing 12-11 on penalties, having fought back from 2-0 down in the final 15 minutes, and Amorim repeatedly said afterwards \"the players spoke really loudly\" with their performance.",
      "Amorim has failed to win any of Manchester United's first three matches of the season despite signing a new front line in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who all featured in the tie, with the pressure growing ahead of their Premier League fixture at home to Burnley on Saturday.",
      "\"I am shocked because we are in the moment when we make a lot of changes, \" Amorim said on ITV. \"We try to fight a lot of things but then when we have these moments, we need to show up.",

      "Speaking earlier this summer, United boss Ruben Amorim felt Garnacho is still a talented player but says things have not worked out for the 21-year-old academy graduate at Old Trafford.",
      "\"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out,\" said Amorim during United's tour of the USA for the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Amorim also revealed that sales this summer are important because he wants a smaller squad this season, given United are not in Europe and will only fight on three fronts.",
      "\"I'm really happy with the team,\" said Amorim. \"Without European competitions, I want a small squad so everyone feels really important.",
      "\"If you have a lot of players, you have one week to prepare and a lot of players are going to be out, and then in training they will be frustrated and then the quality of the training will drop.\"",
      "Man Utd are expecting offers for midfielder Kobbie Mainoo amid growing interest from home and in Europe.",
      "The 20-year-old is understood to be open to leaving, but has not transmitted that stance to the club yet.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in United's opening two Premier League games. United are happy with Mainoo and are not actively looking to let him go - and at this stage, they are very unlikely to consider a loan.",
      "Napoli will hold more talks with United as they look to finalise a deal for striker Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Two other clubs - one from England and one from Germany - made late enquiries for Hojlund. But he wants to go to Napoli. He is ready to travel to Naples once the clubs can agree on the move.",
      "United will do a deal, but on their terms. Both United and Hojlund want a guaranteed permanent element included in any deal.",
      "Napoli's initial proposal was a loan with an option - the option would become mandatory depending on certain conditions being met based on appearances, goals and Champions League qualification.",
      "Discussions between Real Betis and United over Antony have been described as positive and there is a cautious optimism a deal will finally be struck.",
      "After spending the entire window trying to do a straight loan, Betis are working on a deal that will have a mandatory element attached, be that an initial loan or a straight permanent deal.",
      "United have made it clear from the outset that they will not accept another loan move. There is a strong will from all parties to strike a deal before Deadline Day.",
      "Winger Jadon Sancho is exploring his options. A number of clubs are interested in the 25-year-old. Roma are desperate to sign him, but, as it stands, he doesn't want to go to the Serie A side.",
      "United's preference is a permanent deal. However, with just five days to go, another loan cannot be ruled out. Sancho has entered the final year of his contract - United have the option to extend for a further 12 months.",
      "Interest from clubs in Europe is growing in United defender Tyrell Malacia. At this stage, a loan move is the most likely outcome. Malacia has entered the final year of his contract.",
      "Mainoo, meanwhile, is not a Chelsea target. The Blues asked about him in January but they have since moved on.",
      "Fermin Lopez is a player who has been on Chelsea's radar for a long time and they are prepared to make a move if they were to receive any encouragement from Barcelona or the attacking midfielder.",
      "Meanwhile, Nicolas Jackson will only be allowed to leave Chelsea in a permanent move or a loan plus an obligation to buy.",
      "Bayern Munich and Aston Villa want Jackson and there are expected to be more developments when Alexander Isak's future at Newcastle United is resolved.",
      "Juventus have registered their interest in Jackson, but they are currently pressing ahead with trying to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain instead.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Premier League spending has reached an all-time high in this summer's transfer window; net-spend figures show the extent to which Man Utd and Arsenal have strengthened their attacks while Bournemouth's defence looks weakened",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Jim Lethem",
      "Wednesday 27 August 2025 16:30, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have set a new record for spending in a single transfer window this summer at over £2.6bn.",
      "Arsenal's signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace saw the previous record fall with a week of the window still to go.",
      "But how has the money been spent? Using net-spend figures, this week's Between the Lines looks at the positions in which clubs have strengthened this summer - and where they have got weaker.",
      "Nearly half of the £2.6bn spent this summer has gone on forwards. At a whopping £1.4bn, Premier League clubs have splurged roughly £850m more on forward players than on players in any other position, with defenders next on £547m.",
      "The figures highlight the huge value placed on attacking players, particularly in a summer when many of the Premier League's top clubs have been looking to add more firepower.",
      "The most high-profile movers include Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Joao Pedro. But with the Alexander Isak saga rumbling on, the total could soar even higher before Monday's transfer deadline.",
      "Net spend, which factors money received in sales, adds another layer of insight and underlines the scale of the investment made by some of the Premier League's elite sides.",
      "Manchester United sit top, having added Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha as well as Sesko for £207.5m combined. Marcus Rashford has left on loan to Barcelona, but they are yet to offset that spending by selling any of their existing options permanently.",
      "Arsenal are not far behind them for net spend on forwards, with Eze following Noni Madueke and Gyokeres to the club at a combined cost of £180.5m before having made any sales.",
      "Chelsea have also spent heavily, with Joao Pedro one of four attacking signings, but the sales of Madueke, Joao Felix and Armando Broja have helped reduce their net spend to £55m.",
      "While some clubs have bolstered their attacks, others have taken a hit - none more so than Crystal Palace, whose frontline is £67.5m lighter after Eze's move to Arsenal.",
      "Meanwhile, West Ham have made a net profit of £55m on forwards, having not yet replaced Mohammed Kudus, who joined Spurs for £55m, leaving them light in their front line.",
      "Further investment may also be needed at Brighton, Brentford and Wolves, who are ostensibly weaker in attack, with negative net spends, having lost Joao Pedro, Cunha and Mbeumo, respectively.",
      "Moving on to midfield and, following the signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and no sales, Arsenal come out top for net spend on £66m as things stand.",
      "Much of the focus is on Mikel Arteta's attack following their investment this summer but their midfield has also been significantly reinforced, with Zubimendi going straight into the starting line-up following his £51m arrival from Real Sociedad.",
      "Everton and Sunderland are next highest for net spend on midfielders. The Toffees have added Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Charly Alcaraz without losing anyone, while the promoted Black Cats have signed Enzo Le Fee, Granit Xhaka and Habib Diarra to offset the sale of Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Along with Chelsea, Aston Villa currently have a notable negative net spend on midfielders, owing to the £43m sale of Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle. The club are yet to replace the 24-year-old, or bring in any bodies in midfield, leaving Unai Emery with fewer options than last season.",
      "Bournemouth stand out for net spend on defenders. Having lost three members of their first-choice back four last season in Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez for fees worth a combined £144.5m, they are in profit to the tune of £98m.",
      "Replacements have so far been recruited for lower costs, with centre-back Bafode Diakite joining from Lille for £35m and left-back Adrien Truffert arriving from Rennes for £14.4m. Their strong starts show there is value to be found in the market, as Bournemouth previously showed with Huijsen, Zabarnyi and Kerkez.",
      "Andoni Iraola will, however, need more backing defensively. They are still down a body at centre-back. But the club will aim to find the requisite quality while remaining in profit.",
      "It may seem hard to believe on the back of their 5-1 thrashing by Chelsea, and their subsequent 3-2 loss to Wolves in the Carabao Cup, but the side to have strengthened their defence most, in terms of net spend, is West Ham, who have signed Jean-Clair Todibo following his loan spell for £35m and also added full-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.",
      "Liverpool currently have the second-highest net spend on defenders, with Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giovanni Leoni arriving after Real Madrid paid £10m for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Jarell Quansah left for Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.",
      "But their figure could rise further if they add another centre-back, with Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi still a possibility.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Manchester City are the biggest net spenders on goalkeepers so far having re-signed James Trafford for £31m, and there could be more activity as there is uncertainty around the future of Ederson amid links with Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "By selling Trafford to his boyhood club, Burnley are at the other end of the net spend on goalkeepers table, with Martin Dubravka and Max Weiss arriving for much lower fees, leaving them weakened in the position on paper."

      "Monday 25 August 2025 15:37, UK",
      "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.",
      "\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.",
      "\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.",
      "\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.",
      "\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"",
      "For the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.",
      "The Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.",
      "\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Sesko, at the moment, let's just say it, he's nowhere near in terms of fitness or just getting up to speed.\"",
      "Neville feels the striker will need to be given more minutes to build his fitness, starting in Wednesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie away to Grimbsy Town.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him,\" said Neville. \"Last week, I was saying, 'look, let's just get him straight in'.",
      "\"He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football.",
      "\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.",
      "\"I think he let it impact him,\" said Neville. \"I thought he let it get to him. When he came out for the second half, he was still talking to the referee.",
      "\"I know that can happen, but I think you can see in his face sometimes with Bruno that he wears his heart on his sleeve and it was quite clear that obviously he's desperately disappointed about missing the penalty in the way in which he did.",
      "\"Sometimes, if a goalkeeper saves it you might think, 'OK, that happened', but he's smashed it over the bar, and then there was this idea that the referee disrupted his rhythm.",
      "\"It was a complete accident. Obviously the referee was trying to walk back towards the players coming in.",
      "\"He just seemed to let it impact him in the game and I think that's just something that shouldn't have happened really, but that wasn't the biggest problem out there for United today.\"",
