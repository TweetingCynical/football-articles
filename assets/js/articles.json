      "Manchester United held talks with Aston Villa over a potential swap deal for Ollie Watkins as Marcus Rashford came to the end of his loan spell. Rashford, 27, spent the second half of last season at Villa Park, having fallen out on favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The loan deal included an option for Villa to sign the United forward for £40million but it could've been very different had the swap with Watkins came to fruition. The 29-year-old was reportedly available for transfer in January, even being offered to Arsenal.",
      "According to the Athletic, United held discussions with Villa about signing Watkins at the end of the season. The Red Devils have now made a fresh enquiry separate to Rashford, who Villa won't be signing permanently.",
      "Amorim wants to sign a new striker and Watkins has emerged a target, with Rashford having returned to Old Trafford but appearing to have no future at United. Villa, meanwhile, are currently grappling with Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules and it's claimed that they need to make one lucrative sale in order to avoid punishment.",
      "It's been speculated that Villa Park chiefs could follow Chelsea's example and sell their women's team in what would be a controversial move. Selling Watkins would also cause outcry, with Villa already letting one striker leave in the January transfer window before narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "Unai Emery's side sanctioned the departure of Jhon Duran to Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr for a cool £65million. Duran's departure didn't mean that Watkins was always first-choice for Emery, though.",
      "\"I let him (Emery) know that. He's the manager at the end of the day. I respect his decision. But I'm not one of the players happy to sit on the bench.",
      "\"It's something I haven't experienced before, missing out on the biggest stage. You always want to play, especially in the Champions League. Me and a few others are disappointed we didn't start the game, but like I said, it's the manager's decision... Rather than let it hinder you, you have to use that anger as motivation.\"",
      "The England international would almost certainly start most games for the Red Devils, as he's significantly more Premier League-proven compared to United strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. Last season, Watkins bagged 17 goals and laid on 14 assists."

      "Manchester United appear to be readying a third bid for Bryan Mbeumo as they continue their talks with Brentford over a deal for the forward. The Red Devils want to land the Cameroon international in time for the start of their pre-season next week.",
      "That said, the club are reportedly adamant they will not overpay to add to their squad, having seen two deals rejected already. But it seems they will not wait long in their efforts to persuade the Bees.",

Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, after falling out of favour with Amorim over the forward's perceived lack of focus and application in training.",
      "Villa declined to take up an option to sign Rashford for £40million at the end of the loan agreement, leaving the 27-year-old facing an awkward return to United next week to start pre-season. That has left the door open for other clubs to move for Rashford, with Bayern boss Vincent Kompany considering a move for the England star, according to reports from Germany.",

      "Emma Raducanu has become known for regularly switching coaches since soaring into the spotlight in 2021. The 22-year-old parted ways with Andy Murray's father-in-law Nigel Sears shortly before her surprise victory at the US Open almost four years ago.",
      "Raducanu is aiming for more Grand Slam success at Wimbledon this summer. Her stunning US Open victory as a teenager came while working with Andrew Richardson, but their partnership dissolved just weeks after the New York tournament. Prior to her triumph at Flushing Meadows, Raducanu had begun working with Murray's father-in-law, Sears, in April 2021, which saw Raducanu impressively reach the fourth round on her Wimbledon debut.",
      "However, that collaboration was short-lived. Raducanu later explained her thought process behind leaving Sears, who had coached several top stars, including Ana Ivanovic, wife of former Bayern Munich and Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger.",
      "\"After Wimbledon, I was ranked around 200 in the world. And, at the time I thought Andrew would be a great coach to try and I went to the States,\" Raducanu told reporters in September 2021.",
      "\"Never did I even dream of winning the US Open and having the run I did, and now I'm ranked 22 in the world which is pretty crazy to me. It's tough to have that conversation with anyone, but I need someone who's had that professional tour experience, and has been through it, and seen players in my situation for many years, going through the same because it's going to take a lot.",
      "\"I feel like at this stage in my career, and playing the top players in the world, I realised I really need someone right now that has had that WTA Tour experience at the high levels, which means that I'm looking for someone who has been at that level and knows what it takes.\"",
      "It was claimed that Raducanu's move from coach Sears to Richardson may have been influenced by her father's preference for a recognisable companion on her first international events as a pro. However, Raducanu had surged up the rankings unexpectedly after clinching the US Open title, prompting her to seek a mentor with hefty professional expertise.",
      "\"The players at the top are serious competition and serious players. I just really need someone right now who has been through that and can really guide me along the way because I'm still very very new to everything,\" she added.",
      "Sears may have fit the bill, given his past experience working with Daniela Hantuchova, Anett Kontaveit, Ivanoivic and other female stars throughout his career. However, Raducanu ultimately picked Torben Beltz to replace Richardson, a partnership that lasted five months until April 2022.",
      "Afterwards, the young tennis star had stints with Dmitry Tursunov and Sebastian Sachs before allying once more with former LTA Loughborough Academy coach Cavaday just before the 2024 Australian Open. Raducanu's agent, Max Eisenbud, defended the frequent coaching changes in 2023. \"That has been their (Raducanu and her dad's) philosophy all the way up through the juniors,\" he told The Tennis Podcast. \"They never had coaches for a long time. You've probably heard of that.",
      "\"For them, that is calm waters, having a coach for five months and going on to someone else. I think people have a hard time understanding how you can get to the fourth round of Wimbledon and then how you don't keep working with Nigel Sears, who is a great coach and a great guy.\"",
      "\"All the people when she stopped working with Nigel were killing her... then she won the US Open. You were killing her for not staying with Nigel then she won the US Open. Then she changes coaches again. People need to get over the fact that that's what they need to do. It's probably going to be like that for the rest of her career.\"",
      "Wimbledon 2025 has finally begun, and fans can still buy tickets to the sporting event right now.",
      "Raducanu had stopped working with Cavaday in January due to his health issues, but he has since returned to her coaching setup alongside Mark Petchey. Raducanu expressed her happiness at seeing Cavaday again and her confidence in her current coaching team. \"I'm happy to see him healthy, first of all,\" she said last month.",
      "\"I think having Mark and Nick, both people who have banks of experience and I think they can complement each other really well and I trust both of them a lot,\" she explained. \"So that is a big fundamental for me. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to this upcoming season and see how it goes.\"",
      "Following her straight-sets triumph over fellow Brit Mimi Xu, Raducanu has progressed to the second round at Wimbledon. The ex-US Open champion is due to take on Marketa Vondrousova of Czechia in the next round."

      "Of course, some have already figured out their futures. Upon leaving Manchester City, Kevin De Bruyne has landed at Napoli, while Pablo Sarabia has departed Wolves for Al Arabi.",

The Ghana international could anchor a midfielder including creativity from Christian Eriksen and the legs and talent of Abdoulaye Doucoure.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin may be the forward option with the most top-flight options this summer and his all round game ensures he makes the cut. There are pure goalscorers remaining in the shape of Callum Wilson and Jamie Vardy however, in addition to remaining options in the shape of Michail Antonio and Danny Ings.",
      "Willian's Fulham exit may have facilitated some width and creativity this side would need. The crop of players without club is light on wingers with Ashley Young more well-versed as a full-back in recent times.",

      "United's list of options already includes Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike, both of whom have interest from elsewhere. The Red Devils are focussing on their attack in the summer transfer window, having spent £62.5million to sign Matheus Cunha last month and bidding up to £63m for Bryan Mbeumo.",

Now contact has been made to explore the conditions of a separate deal after Villa - who remain at risk of breaching Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules - confirmed that Rashford's loan wouldn't be made permanent.",
      "Had Arsenal been successful in their pursuit, though, Watkins wouldn't be on the market. The Gunners made a bid for the England international, who Villa were willing to let go while fellow striker Jhon Duran was still at the club.",

      "\"Villa have spent a lot of money, and they need to get something back. In an ideal world, you probably would sell Ollie Watkins and keep Jhon Duran because he is the younger player - he is only 21.\"",
      "Arsenal are no longer focussed on Watkins, with Gyokeres and RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko emerging as their top striker targets. United could therefore have a free run at the 29-year-old, who Villa could demand less for amid their concerning financial predicament."

      "Away from Mbeumo, Giles also gave an update on the future of midfielder Christian Norgaard, who has been strongly linked with a switch to Arsenal. He added: \"Arsenal approached us in the last two weeks about Christian regularly with Andrea Berta.",
      "\"I think it's fair to say it's fair to say it's more likely to happen than not. We have to go through the full process, tick all the boxes and then we'll see at the end of it.",
      "\"He's been a fantastic player than us, unbelievable. I'm actually happy for him with the opportunity at this stage, 31, at this stage of his career to have an opportunity to go and try win some trophies.",
      "\"It isn't done yet but we're aware that if and when he does depart, we have a leadership void to try and fill. Also thinking about Ben Mee who also left this summer and Mark Flekken who's an experienced goalkeeper.",
      "\"We're aware of the squad and the blend of experiences we have in the squad and we'll look to cover it.\"",

      "The Red Devils are currently navigating the summer transfer window as they gear up for the 2025/26 Premier League season. Matheus Cunha has already been snapped up by United, and negotiations are underway to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford.",
      "It's yet to be seen who else United will pursue before the transfer window shuts on 1 September. However, when it comes to departures, at least nine players are certain to leave the club this summer.",

      "It seems unlikely Villa would sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows, especially when there are limited striker options to replace Watkins currently in the transfer market.",
      "Villa are also a direct rival to United due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers during his reign and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Watkins has scored 87 goals during his time in Birmingham and reliable goalscorers are difficult to find, so Villa would obviously be better off sticking and not twisting in this summer window.",
      "The only way a deal would make sense from a Villa perspective would be if United submitted a bid that was impossible to reject, but United are not going to break the bank for any player, never mind a 29-year-old.",

      "Amorim remains wedded to his 3-4-2-1 formation and his two attacking midfielders and his forward have to be the main provider of the team's goals.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves for one of those attacking midfield positions. The decision was made early to activate his £62.5million release clause and it is hoped he will be able to replicate the form that saw him scored 17 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "They are also keen to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo to fill the other attacking midfield slot. While a deal hasn't been agreed, United are hopeful of concluding a deal for the 25-year-old this summer.",
      "The Cameroon international scored 20 Premier League goals last term, a feat that hasn't been achieved by any United player in the last 12 years.",
      "While Cunha and Mbeumo should make a huge difference to United's attacking output, it would be futile not to sign a proven goalscorer to lead the line too.",
      "The likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Hugo Ekitike and Victor Osimhen have been linked with moves to United but they would all command huge transfer fees and are not proven at Premier League level.",
      "That's what made links with Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins all the more interesting on Monday evening, particularly given he played with Mbeumo at Brentford. The Athletic reported that United have enquired about his availability this summer after a frustrating end to last season.",
      "While the England international's name isn't as eye-catching as the other options, his proven Premier League goalscoring pedigree would make any move for the 29-year-old desirable.",
      "Watkins scored 17 goals last season, 27 goals the season before that and 16 goals the season before that and that level of consistency should make him a low risk, high reward signing for any Premier League side.",
      "No signings guarantee success but if United can unleash a front three who all boast proven Premier League pedigree then the chances of solving their goalscoring issues will be much higher."

The 23-year-old striker has been heavily linked with Liverpool and Chelsea recently following his impressive performances in the Bundesliga.",

      "However, it appears the race for Gyokeres could have been run. Along with United, Arsenal have been heavily invested in the Swede and their interest dates back further than the Reds.",
      "Like Amorim, Mikel Arteta has been keen to strengthen his attack having been left with no recognised centre-forwards for large parts of the second portion of the season. According to L'Equipe, the Gunners are closing in on rectifying that as they near a verbal agreement with Gyokeres' team over personal terms for the striker.",
      "Journalist Sacha Tavolieri has gone a step further though and claims that Arsenal have an agreement over a five-year deal with Gyokeres' agent and that the north London club are now turning their focus to negotiations with Sporting over a transfer fee.",

      "Leon does have an opportunity to be an option on the left flank this season. Patrick Dorgu is the first choice on that side and while Luke Shaw is a mainstay at Old Trafford, his recent injury record means United could find themselves short if they do not integrate Leon into the first-team.",
      "The 18-year-old's first chance to impress in a match will be on July 19 when the Reds travel to Stockholm to face Leeds in pre-season.

Not all of these appearances were starts either with the forward sharing the starting spot with Jhon Duran and Marcus Rashford.",
      "After Watkins entered the list of players to watch this summer, MEN Sport has rounded up the latest information regarding the England international and a move to Old Trafford.",
      "On Monday, The Athletic reported that Watkins could be targeted by the Reds if they are to sell Rasmus Hojlund this summer. While a deal for Watkins would only develop in the latter stages of the window, at £60m his price tag is steep.",
      "The forward is 29 so the amount of resale value is limited for the Reds. However, with three years remaining on his deal at Villa Park, Unai Emery will be unwilling to budge on that valuation.",
      "The dilemma for United is whether a proven goalscorer in the top flight is worth paying that bit extra for.",
      "It has been well documented that Villa have been looking nervously over their shoulder regarding Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) concerns. To avoid falling foul of those rules, it was reported that Villa may look to sell some of their big name players including Watkins and Emiliano Martinez.",
      "However, The Telegraph reports that Villa are expected to raise around £55m after selling their women's team. This deal could stop the West Midlands club from needing to sell their top assets or bend to the negotiations of United - and could therefore keep his price tag relatively high.",

      "United’s most recent bid, in excess of £60 million, was rejected by Brentford last week, so whether a deal can be completed before players return for pre-season training next week remains to be seen. Yet, the current gap in valuation may force United to consider shelving their interest - at least temporarily.",
      "While Mbeumo has just 12 months left on his contract, Brentford hold an option to trigger a one-year extension, effectively making it two years. If the player is happy to stay at the Gtech Community Stadium, as the club's sporting director suggests, should a move not materialise, Brentford are under little pressure to compromise - especially if they’re not dealing with a player desperate to leave.",

      "That said, if United are either unwilling or unable to meet Brentford’s valuation, they may be forced to show patience - potentially waiting six, or more likely twelve, months.",
      "Next summer, should Brentford trigger the one-year extension, Mbeumo would enter the final year of his contract. United could then return to the table with increased negotiating power, as the player would no longer command the same fee.",
      "They could well land Mbeumo for a reduced price, but it’s equally valid to argue that the cost of missing out on him this summer may outweigh the financial savings of waiting a year.

In terms of transfers, July 1 marks the start of a new financial year meaning United and the rest of the Premier League can enter the transfer market with more wriggle room for manoeuvre.",
      "Alongside Mbeumo, United are expected to target a new centre-forward and possibly a goalkeeper, depending on what happens with Andre Onana. As this is a dream scenario looking at July, United will want Mbeumo and a striker to be part of the group that travels to the United States in a few weeks time.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is still the priority for United with Amorim and the centre-forward having a strong relationship. Talk of alternatives such as Moise Kean and Jonathan David have gone quiet in recent weeks and it all points to a move for the Sporting CP star.",

By the time August 1 comes, the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund will all be out the door. Ideally, the Reds would have managed to sell, at least, two of them to raise funds.",

Ayden Heaven, Harry Amass, Toby Collyer and Chido Obi will all want to gain valuable time on the pitch with the first-team while the priority for Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo will be to increase their match sharpness.",

      "Jonny Evans has been appointed head of loans and pathways at Manchester United after retiring from his playing career.",
      "Evans was expected to hang up his boots after the conclusion of his contract at Old Trafford this summer, and he has officially announced the end of a career that spanned 20 years.",
      "The 37-year-old will remain in Manchester to take charge of loans at United, though.",
      "Evans has been appointed as head of loans and pathways at Carrington, meaning he will arrange loans for youngsters and work closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first-team'.",
      "In a statement, Evans said: “I want to officially announce my retirement from my playing career, not with sadness, but with pride, gratitude and excitement for the next chapter ahead.",
      "\"I’ll be forever indebted to the managers, coaches, staff and, of course, my team-mates, that I have had the privilege of working alongside throughout my 20 years in professional football.",
      "“My biggest and most heartfelt thanks must go to the fans who have supported me during every step of the journey. It’s been an honour to be on the pitch and feel your passion home and away; I will be eternally grateful for every ounce of support.",
      "“I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential. Having had experience of loans myself, I know the crucial role that they can play within a player’s development.",
      "\"I am excited to help further develop the pathway to our first team and continue the legacy of young players thriving at Manchester United.”",
      "Director of football Wilcox said: “Having just finished his exceptional playing career, Jonny is the perfect role model for our young players.",
      "\"Jonny’s knowledge of what it takes to succeed at Manchester United will be of great benefit to each of them as we continue to develop world-class talent capable of performing in our first team.”",
      "Evans' transition into the role confirms the end of a wonderful playing career. The defender enjoyed two stints at United after coming through the club's academy and made 241 appearances for the Reds.",
      "The Northern Irishman won the Champions League, three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups with United, while he made a total of 536 career appearances.",
      "Evans made 107 caps for Northern Ireland and was awarded an MBE in 2023 for his services to football."

      "United typically host a celebration event at Old Trafford for the latest intake of scholars, which is recognition of their achievement, and Ngwashi will be among those who attend.",
      "Academy staff discussed a pathway to the first-team with Ngwashi and his family during discussions.",
      "Ngwashi made his league debut for the Under-18s at the beginning of March and was handed his debut for the Under-21s just a few weeks later, which proves how highly he is rated.",
      "The 16-year-old is a natural centre-back and he is seen as a youngster with high potential.",
      "Ngwashi's passing ability is exceptional and he's a ball-playing defender who is a huge asset to build-up play. His stature is impressive and he is considered a potential future star.",
      "Ruben Amorim has given more chances to academy players in recent months and Ngwashi will look to progress in the U21 set-up this season after deciding to remain in Manchester.",
      "Ngwashi has already represented youth teams for Italy and England, although he will not have to pledge his allegiance to a nation until later in his career. He represented England's Under-17s in February."

      "Timothy Fosu-Mensah, the ex-Manchester United defender, is optimistic about his future in football, insisting that his dedication \"won't go unnoticed\" as he seeks a new club after two years away from competitive play.",
      "The Ajax academy graduate made a name for himself at Old Trafford, where he rose through the ranks to make 30 appearances for the senior team, a number that could have been greater if not for loan spells and injuries.",
      "Fosu-Mensah's career was hampered by an anterior cruciate ligament injury while on loan at Fulham in 2019, followed by another setback in February 2021 during his time with Bayer Leverkusen, limiting him to just seven league outings.",
      "Now recovered from those setbacks, the 27-year-old is eager to reignite his career following a season without a club.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "\"Last season was the first time in my career that I've spent without a team,\" Fosu-Mensah shared with PA.",
      "\"At this age it's quite early and I think quite strange for people. I know I've been working hard and hard work won't go unnoticed. That's what I believe.",
      "\"If you stay at home, you do nothing and then you think 'boom, OK, I'm going to go this club or that club', no, that's not how it works, that's not my mentality. It's definitely a fresh start and I've been working hard.\"",
      "Despite his last competitive match being in April 2023, Fosu-Mensah is confident he won't find it difficult to return to the game, citing his fitness routine and the examples of others who have come back from various absences.",
      "After departing Bayer without making an appearance during their triumphant 2023-24 season, Fosu-Mensah has spoken about feeling as robust as ever, both mentally and physically.",
      "Despite being on the bench several times and fit for nearly the entire campaign, he faced more unsettling issues following his release last summer.",
      "\"There was a couple of situations with agents here and there, which was a bit of a mess,\" he disclosed. \"People were speaking on my name who I never even had contact with.",
      "\"I would say like 80 per cent of the agents who were approaching clubs and people I didn't even know, who I didn't even had contact with. I think that was a big mess.\"",
      "He acknowledged discussions about a potential move to the Championship during the winter – \"some of them I was aware of, some of them I wasn't,\".",
      "His subsequent five months with Ajax proved advantageous, where he trained with both the reserves and first team, participating in behind-closed-doors matches, and continued with daily summer workouts in pursuit of a comeback.",
      "Speaking from his home in the Netherlands after one such training session, alongside Brian Brobbey and Steven Bergwijn, Fosu-Mensah expressed his enduring affection for Manchester United.",
      "\"I'll always be a fan of United,\" he affirmed. \"Always. I came there when I was 16, I left when I was 23. I've had many nice moments, won a couple of trophies, especially in my first season.",
      "\"We all know United, we all know the history of United, we all know what United stands for.",
      "\"Even this last season the Premier League was difficult for them but they reached the Europa League final, so it's something in the DNA of the club that they always want to win trophies.",
      "\"I have analysed the manager (Ruben Amorim) and I have seen a little bit how he plays and what he wants from his players.",
      "\"Jeremiah St Juste from Sporting Lisbon is a good friend of mine and he had great words for the manager, so I'm positive that United brought in a good manager.\"",
      "Fosu-Mensah is hopeful that \"good things will happen to the club and to the players\" next season, including Marcus Rashford who made his Premier League debut alongside him against Arsenal in February 2016.",
      "\"I just want him to be happy,\" he added. \"Everybody just wants him to be happy.",
      "\"The most important things is for him to feel good, for him to feel happy. Look, the quality is definitely there. Nobody needs to say anything about this quality, because he's a top player.\""

      "Fletcher is currently a first-team coach within Ruben Amorim's backroom staff. The former midfielder has been regarded as an important conduit between the academy and the senior squad due to his knowledge of the academy, so United believe Fletcher would be a strong fit for the U18 job.",
      "The 41-year-old wants to explore a career in management. Fletcher was previously reluctant to take an academy role due to his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, being in the system, but they have now progressed as players.",
      "Fletcher initially returned to Old Trafford in 2020 to take up a minor academy role, and he was appointed as the club's inaugural technical director in March 2021 before being relocated following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment.",
      "After Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake, he hired Jason Wilcox as technical director - Wilcox was recently promoted to director of football - and Fletcher became a first-team coach.",
      "Lawrence's departure was unrelated to the club-wide redundancies, and he said that it was a \"privilege\" to work for United when he released a statement confirming his exit.",
      "Lawrence oversaw a treble with the U18s in 2023/2024, winning two trophies at the expense of rivals Man City, and he targeted winning the prestigious FA Youth Cup last season.",

      "Arsenal could make another raid on Chelsea while they are linked with most of the wingers in Europe, while Marcus Rashford is on Bayern Munich’s list…",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Arsenal\nFrom BILD, Arsenal have joined the race for the France striker, which suits Eintracht Frankfurt just fine. While they’re insisting on £85million, they need the market to look as busy as they can make it appear. And it does Arsenal no harm while they continue to barter with other clubs over other strikers.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. A Watkins-Marcus Rashford swap seems awfully convenient for all concerned…",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Arsenal\nReports suggest Arsenal ‘appreciate’ Elanga but not to the point of picking up the phone yet, so he appears a long way down their list of winger targets. Newcastle probably have little reason to worry.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Bayern Munich\nWhen you scratch the surface of the reports of Bayern’s interest, it seems Rashford makes only their ‘longlist’ of targets. And it seems a similar story at Barcelona. So if Rashford is to get his big move to a European club in contention for titles, it almost certainly won’t be until late in the window by which time United will have been backed into a corner.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo, but Madueke has already been the subject of a bid, apparently.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "9) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "4) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – and Quansah is now in Germany to get it all done.",
      "",
      "3) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Chelsea\nThis one moved fast over the weekend, when Newcastle and Chelsea both had bids rejected before the Blues went back with something more acceptable to the Seagulls. Apparently, the Brazilian will undergo a medical in the the United States before joining Enzo Maresca’s Club World Cup squad. He could make his debut on Friday against Palmeiras in Philly.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London a week ago to complete his move, but Arsenal won’t be rushed this summer. This week, surely…",
      "at long last, the midfielder was in London a week ago to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "Man City lost; that was good\nYes, the Club World Cup has mostly been crap and ignorable. But Man City Vs Al-Hilal nwas thrilling wasn’t it? More games like that and this competition will become watchable.\nDan, London",
      "",
      "Man Utd transfers have gone all weird\nThe whole raft of transfer business at United currently is fairly weird. Last summer, and across the year, the focus was bringing in talented youth players who were at the cusp of breaking through, but who needed maybe a year before being thrown in to the first team squad and integrated. Inevitably, some have stepped up (or had to come in) earlier but the approach was solid and sensible. Exciting even!",
      "As a result, we go into this next season with Obi, Yoro, Amass, Heaven and Collyer having got first-team minutes. A few others like Kone, and maybe Moorhouse and even Fletcher, look ready to push too.",
      "But the point was that there was a plan to focus on a multi-year strategy to build things back up. Not trying to sign Mbappe, but sign the next Mbappe.",
      "We finally got to the end of the hilariously bad season and the squad needs were clear: we needed a 10 who could actually link up with the striker, we probably need a new striker (although I stand by that not being vital this summer, we just need to supply them), and we needed someone to play RWB (handily resolved by adding a 10 and moving Amad out to the wing). Equally critically we needed to shift some players: four wingers, a left back who barely plays, a (supposed) right back, a DM who can’t play in the league and a CB who can’t defend.",
      "Now we’ve entered this summer and are instead throwing relatively big sums and certainly big wages on players with one good season behind them, at 25 and 26 years old (and potentially at similar aged strikers), instead of the next generation. And if we DO get both, that leaves us with three LWB (Dorgu, Amass, Leon), three and a half RW/RWB (Amad, Mbeumo, Mazraoui and Dalot), 4 players for the 2 #10 roles (Cunha, Mount, Mainoo, Zirklee), 2 players for the #8 (Bruno, Collyer), 2 more for the #6 (Ugarte and Casemiro).",
      "And that’s before you include many of those “kids who are pushing for first team”, some mentioned above. It’s just too many when we’ll basically have one game a week. So, how do they get playing time? What, Bruno is going to drop out for a game is he so Collyer can get minutes? Mount will probably be injured but if he’s not then how can we possibly give all the 10s enough game time?",
      "Adding more players to the pit isn’t the answer here. The initial plan of investing in youth, bringing them through and clearing out the squad – ideally breaking the manager’s addiction to Portuguese full backs that can’t play the role in the process – is the way to go. Adding two more players “at their peak” who will either own that spot at the cost of game time for the younger ones – and surely only plastic fans will want to see Mbeumo over Amad – or be yet another overpaid albatross we can’t shoo off the boat, is just utterly utterly bonkers.",
      "This was the year to trim things back. Seems like there are no lessons learned at United. Funny thing, though, is that by Christmas we’ll be in the market for some right-footed wingers again (maybe loaning them out is an accidental masterstroke after all).\nBadwolf",

How do you stop buying duds? Data analysis. Long term planning. Individual genius. United have pitched their long term planning on a system that Amorim got to work in Portugal but has been utterly incompetent at deploying in the UK. He will be gone by Christmas.

      "The Gunners are concentrating on their efforts to sign a new centre-forward after lining up deals for Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard and Kepa Arrizabalaga.",
      "Pundits, former players and supporters have urged Arsenal over the last couple of years to bring in a top-class striker to help take Mikel Arteta’s side to the next level.",
      "And it seems as though they will finally do that this summer with Sporting CP’s Gyokeres and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko both heavily linked to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed recently that Gyokeres’ “priority” is Arsenal despite strong interest from Manchester United this summer.",
      "Romano said: “The question for many United fans is has Viktor Gyokeres rejected Manchester United to go to Arsenal? Guys let me explain the Gyokeres situation – Gyokeres has not told ‘Man United no I’m not coming goodbye’,",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Arsenal’s Eze link intensifies, crunch time for Liverpool star",
      "“His agent, speaking to Man United almost ten days ago told Manchester United that his priority is Arsenal. So the priority of Viktor Gyokeres is to go to Arsenal – he would love to go to Arsenal for several reasons, including obviously Champions League football, but Viktor Gyokeres didn’t say no to Manchester United.",
      "“So, the priority of the player is Arsenal, the player is waiting for Arsenal. Arsenal are waiting to understand how much Viktor Gyokeres will cost.",
      "“I told you there is this battle between the agents of the players to respect the pact for €60-65 exit fee this summer.”",
      "But Portuguese publication Record insists that Sporting president Frederico Varandas’ recent comments to the media stating that Gyokeres won’t be sold for €60m plus €10m have further angered the Sweden international.",

      "And now former Coventry City striker Gyokeres fears that Sporting’s €80m demands mean he will miss out on a summer transfer to Arsenal.",
      "Record write: ‘The striker and his manager fear that Sporting’s demand for €80m, as a result of “Vik’s” exceptional performance in 2024/25, will jeopardise a move to Arsenal, the club where Gyökeres clearly wants to continue his career.’",
      "The Portuguese newspaper, who apparently have seen texts exchanged between the striker and Varandas, add that Gyokeres has decided not to turn up for pre-season training.",
      "Record continues: ‘Finally, Gyökeres shared a third outburst with the president of Sporting: the number 9 of the Lions reiterated that he is tired, and this was the expression transmitted to Record by a source close to the player, of hearing Varandas speak “constantly” to the media with information that he disapproves of and that, in his opinion, is not credible, as it only intends to divert the focus from a solution.’",
      "Arsenal are closing in on Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, with the Swede keen on the move and a long-term contract already ‘agreed’.",
      "Arsenal could sign Viktor Gyokeres today for €60m (£51m) despite comments from the Sporting CP president, according to reports.",

      "That feels more than a tad optimistic given Ter Stegen’s age and a Transfermarkt value of €12m [£10.2m] and surely rules out a move to Chelsea, who baulked at AC Milan’s £20m asking price for Mike Maignan, who’s significantly younger (29) and arguably better, albeit with just one year left to run on his current deal compared to Ter Stegen’s three.",
      "But Barcelona need not search for a transfer patsy as Manchester United are also keen on Ter Stegen as an upgrade on Onana. Having already overpaid for Matheus Cunha and looking as though they will do again to sign Bryan Mbeumo, United could well be Barcelona’s knight in gold-encrusted armour.",

      "We’re very much here for a footballer digging their heels in and refusing to leave while under contract, and we totally get the desire to stay in Barcelona even without any sort of guarantee of game time, but we also think footballers should be playing football and we can see Christensen playing a pretty significant role at Newcastle as Fabian Schar turns 34 in December.",
      "Eddie Howe was keen on signing Christensen in January and with Champions League football back at St James’ Park next term, a guy with 45 appearances in Europe’s showcase competition who played a key role in Chelsea winning it in 2021 is surely worth more to Newcastle than what they would have to pay – around £15m.",

It’s claimed the Barcelona bosses see this window ‘as an opportunity to either keep a motivated Araujo fit and ready for the season or receive a substantial transfer fee that would help balance the wage bill and fund other squad signings’.",
      "We strongly suspect they would much rather the latter as that’s an absurdly risky motivational tool for a player you want to keep at your football club.",

      "But he’s not about to provide too many midfield headaches for Mikel Arteta and knowing without doubt which three players will start in midfield for Arsenal at the start of next season isn’t necessarily a good thing.",
      "That would also be the case if their slightly dubious interest in Casado becomes more concrete and they land the 21-year-old, but at least he could usurp Martin Zubimendi in that defensive midfield role in time, whereas that’s just not going to happen for Norgaard unless Zubimendi is laughably unsuited to the Premier League.",
      "Casado enjoyed a breakout season for Barcelona in 2024/2025 but faces a rather more difficult fight for game time next term following Marc Bernal’s return from injury to compete with Frenkie de Jong for a starting spot alongside Pedri, and Barcelona are reportedly open to cashing in on their academy graduate.",

      "We imagine Unai Emery’s a very hard man to say no to though. All we need is for the pair to be in a confined space for an hour and for Barcelona to drop that asking price by £10m or so for the deal to go through.",

Predictably, as many as eight La Liga clubs have reportedly approached them over a move for the 23-year-old at that price.",

      "They’re not – they can’t afford one – but they’re also not in a position to turn down decent offers for a 36-year-old, and we’re pretty convinced he would score a bundle for Liverpool, because Lewandowski’s right, he’s not all that different a player to what we saw from him in his prime on the back of 42 goals in 52 games last term.",

      "Matheus Cunha should be used to overpriced accusations, but having the finger of blame pointed by Newcastle and Sporting should help Manchester United.",
      "",
      "As the most pivotal summer transfer window at Old Trafford since the last stumbles into a second month under the duress of impasses and ‘huge blows’, it seems important to take stock.",
      "Ruben Amorim implored his employers to be “brave”, and solving problems in attack by spending £62.5m of a thoroughly limited budget on a forward who has reached double digits for goals in three of eight seasons as a professional, while absurdly overvaluing a problem winger and three other players in the same position when selling to buy is imperative, arguably ticks that box.",
      "The hope is that Matheus Cunha is at the absolute least a character upgrade on Alejandro Garnacho and his fellow bomb squad members; the Brazilian needs to be a solider willing to make sacrifices rather than a sulk who disrupts the dressing room.",
      "But Wolves supporters might be interested in what results any due diligence on and personality assessment of Cunha returned after the disciplinary issues and social media shenanigans which threatened to derail their season.",
      "It would be entirely on-brand for Manchester United to not only adopt a new recruitment strategy about half a decade after their contemporaries first implemented it, but for them to also a) part with the individual responsible for it within a year, and b) then completely ignore it.",
      "Does signing a potential ‘knob-end’ count as a violation of the ‘no-dickheads’ policy which has formed the foundation of many of modern sport’s great teams? It is certainly a grey area.",
      "But if Cunha did not already sense a suffocating pressure upon securing his “dream” move to a fallen giant, the weight of responsibility for distorting the entire market could be felt soon.",
      "It would be foolish to pretend Sporting president Frederico Varandas and the contacts of a prominent Newcastle journalist do not have ulterior motives, and that the mere mention of Manchester United does not magnify a story tenfold.",
      "Yet an elite athlete can only take those two separate instances of scapegoating personally. Cunha has been specifically cited as both a case study for Sporting when increasing the asking price for Viktor Gyokeres, and the exorbitant reason for Newcastle not yet signing a single player.",
      "Whether being used as the justification for external avarice or incompetence, it seems a little harsh considering Cunha’s age, Premier League pedigree and established history of gradually rising in value to hold him as 2025’s Neymar, the signing against which all others should be measured and inflated.",
      "A forward with 42 goals and assists in 82 Premier League appearances, who turned 26 in May and is a fixture in the Brazil national team, having a release clause activated which ranks him around 20th in terms of the most expensive British signings ever, seems relatively standard fare.",
      "Yet the addition of Manchester United to the equation inevitably makes Cunha either a yardstick, a stick to beat his new club with or preferably both.",
      "It is an accusation the player should be used to. His £44m move to Wolves in January 2023 seemed a flagrant waste of money when it produced two goals in 17 games in his first half-season, but Cunha soon realised his potential at Molineux under Gary O’Neil, the future of Manchester United coaching.",
      "The ‘overpriced’ label is one thing, but the lowest bar in terms of hope and expectation is that Sir Jim Ratcliffe does not feel compelled to name Cunha as one of the “overpaid” players the club is still paying for years later.",
      "Those instalments have hampered Manchester United in this critical transfer window and increased the need for Cunha to hit the ground sprinting; Newcastle and Sporting pointing the finger is just added motivation.",
      "Manchester United signed three of the five most expensive players ever in terms of cumulative transfer fees while being rejected by the other two.",

      "Man Utd are paying London pint prices\nI don’t disagree with the opinion that United have overpaid for players. The gripe with Glazer ownership over the last 20 years has rarely been a lack of spending but instead how poorly that money was spent. Huge sums for unsuitable and unworthy players has become part of the club’s identity.",
      "When looking at the INEOS transfers from last season there was a marked reduction in the sums paid. For only the second time in 10 years the club spent no more than £50m on any one player, and only this sum for a highly sort young talent with good resale potential. The rest, £40m Ugarte, £38m De Ligt, £35m Zirkzee, £25m Dorgu, £13m Mazraoui, feel about right given the current market. With hindsight these may be judged as overpaying given varying degrees of success but we’ll see.",
      "This year United have returned to the larger sums with Cunha and potentially Mbeumo both costing around £63m each. While its easy to consider this ‘same old United’ overpaying for players I see it more as a reaction to a 15th place league finish and Europa League loss. The club has to have a good season this time, and by good I mean not nearly as shit. They need to move significantly up the table to at least the European qualification positions so they need impactful low risk signing to enable this. That means buying from among the best players in the Premier League.",
      "Like buying a pint in London signing players from other Premier League clubs just costs more. There are logical economic reasons why it costs more but it’s hard to reconcile when the sums are so large. This isn’t not a uniquely United problem though. Grealish, Nunes, Caicedo, Fofana, Lavia, Rice, Van Dijk are just some of the names that spring to mind. Arguments of overpaying aside its easy to imagine these players costing two-thirds or even half what clubs paid if they had been from the continent.",
      "The money that has made the Premier League so strong from top to bottom also insulates smaller clubs from selling their best players. A club’s position in the league will always be more valuable to them than any one transfer fee. Brentford keeping Mbeumo might ensure they avoid relegation which could be worth hundreds of millions over the next few years. That the player has expressed his desire to move and a need to avoid asset value loss are the only reasons they are entertaining United’s interest.",
      "Buying anything from someone who doesn’t want to sell and doesn’t particularly need to sell will always result in overpaying. Mbuemo probably isn’t worth £63m in comparison to others signed from Europe, he might have been £40m if bought from an Italian or Portuguese club, but if he meets expectations and has the immediate impact required then he probably is worth it to United. Paying more isn’t ideal but for significantly reduced risk, for a player who won’t need months to adjust to the league, I don’t think it’s unreasonable.\nDave, Manchester",

London is a more attractive place for footballers, and Pedro is already down south, it’s a logical and understandable outcome.",
      "What do Newcastle do now? We’re still intent on overpaying for a 22 year old GK with no Premier League experience when we’re short handed outfield. It feels like Newcastle will have to grit their teeth and get Elanga done just to avoid looking like the summer has been a complete waste of time. Guehi is going to Liverpool, we can’t compete, so we’re back to square one with a centre back target.",
      "I think Isak will stay but maybe only one more season as the way things are shaping up we’re making a choice to leave easy for him with the lack of ambition to build a squad capable of being more than only occasional Champions League entrants, before crumbling across all fronts under the weight of games on a threadbare squad.",
      "To be honest it does already look like the summer is a disaster for Howe and that he’s really screwed the pooch in taking the reins himself. If you insist on you and your son doing all the business and nothing gets done, maybe Mitchell had a point after all? Excellent coach and manager he may be, but we were warned that transfers were not Howe’s strength from his time at Bournemouth – this part of the job, the negotiation and finalisation of deals, should have been kept away from him.",
      "It’s now about disaster management and trying to salvage the season before it begins. We’re not going to get first team additions in – they’ve all been taken and there’s no plan B. So we need depth to cover a very good first XI and that means warm bodies in asap.",
      "My two cents are that we get Calvert-Lewin on a free. With his injury record he could be another crock like Wilson, but when fit he’s a good option off the bench, Howe could work some coaching magic, he’s a different option to Isak, and he has to be more reliable than Wilson who we’re trying to re-sign.",
      "If Charlie Cresswell is keen on the mackems he’d step over his mother to play for Newcastle and has an affordable release clause which means no ‘Saudi’ tax so there is a CB sorted who can cover and also develop. Gomez from Liverpool would be a utility player who would get a lot of starts and wouldn’t cost the earth. Again, with his injury record it’s a gamble but he won’t be first choice playing 45+ games, he’ll cover for injuries across the backline and give breaks to older legs. This isn’t just recency bias based on the U21s, but Harvey Elliott can play on the right wing and the middle. He will be more expensive now but if we were willing to go to £50m each for Pedro and Elanga surely Liverpool will come to an agreement there within that scope if he’s not wanted? All that might leave some headroom for Trafford who we appear fixated on.",
      "Those players fit the profile Howe seems to be after – young, English, and with the exception of Cresswell and Trafford, plenty of Premier League experience. I know anyone can make these transfers sound easy but if Sunderland are doing their business surely we can get something done which will save what could be a catastrophe in the making.\nJames, Leeds",

      "We got warning signs when Leeds nearly went belly up after spending way more than they should and then failing. So the FA introduced the fit and proper test, which was a laughably easy to trick PR campaign designed to stop silly owner behaviour. But it was a few years later when that chap who bought Portsmouth for a quid waltzed past the fit and proper test and proceeded to almost bankrupt the club by not knowing what the f*** he was doing and also not having the money to cover the debts which was part of the agreement for the £1 sale.",
      "So they ripped up the woefully inadequate fit and proper test and created a newer more strict version of it which was supposed to ensure owners actually wanted to succeed with the club and not just flip it like a meme coin rug pull.",
      "That’s why PSR exists. It’s not for fairness, it’s not to gatekeep the top 6 or shut out the average working class Joes of…Saudi royal family. It was just to stop silly behaviour. Because there was Leeds, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Derby…and many more who flirted with bankruptcy and that looked f***ing awful for the Premier League as it essentially said their product was awful.",
      "PSR was invented for that purpose. Somewhere along the line people got the idea it was about fairness..it never was. And more importantly absolutely nobody gave a shit about fairness for 120 years of football prior to that. Loads of teams have had their dynasties and each time it’s mostly done by buying other team’s best players.",

      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
