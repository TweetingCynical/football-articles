      "Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo could decide on his next club as soon as today, it has been claimed. The Ghana international is one of the Premier League's most in-demand players, with a release clause making a January move away from the Vitality Stadium a strong possibility.",
      "The Cherries will allow potential suitors to speak to their top scorer if they receive a £65million bid, but only if that bid arrives by January 10. The agreement, entered into when Semenyo signed a new deal over the summer, is thought to be designed to give Andoni Iraola's team time to find a replacement.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are among the clubs to have been linked with the former Bristol City star, who has eight goals and three assists in the Premier League this season. Arsenal and Tottenham were also mentioned as potential destinations over the summer, but the Gunners' moves for Ebere Eze and Noni Madueke mean they look less likely to break the bank.",
      "Liverpool were also linked over the summer, opting instead to move for other targets. Among them was Alexander Isak, and an injury to the Reds' record buy could prompt them to return for Semenyo in January.",
      "Semenyo scored again over the weekend, though it wasn't enough for victory against Burnley. The goal was his second in as many matches after scoring his team's first in their 4-4 draw away to Manchester United.",
      "After the Burnley game, Bournemouth boss Iraola was asked about interest in Semenyo. \"He is a massive player for us. It is not a big secret,\" he said.",
      "Over the weekend, it was reported that Manchester United were ready to go 'all out' to land Semenyo. The Red Devils added around £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer, though one of those new additions - Cameroon forward Bryan Mbeumo - is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim met Semenyo earlier in the year, and there have been suggestions he sees the Cherries star as someone who can operate as a wing-back after successfully moving winger Amad into a similar role.",
      "\"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" Amorim said when asked about new additions in January. \"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "\"We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lisandro Martinez is ready to step up and continue in midfield after filling in for the injured Bruno Fernandes against Aston Villa. Martinez was summoned from the bench to play in the centre of the pitch at Villa Park and could be drafted into the same role against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Manchester United’s captain was forced off at half-time of their 2-1 defeat by Villa on Sunday in the Premier League and is facing a spell on the sidelines. Ruben Amorim has just three fit first-team midfielders for the upcoming visit of Newcastle to Old Trafford: Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.",
      "The United manager handed debuts to academy graduates Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey on Sunday, but it was Martinez who he turned to at half-time. The Argentina international defender only recently returned from 11 months on the sidelines with an ACL injury and acquitted himself well at Villa.",
      "While Martinez is primarily a centre-back, he spent three years at Ajax where positional flexibility is coached and has filled in at left-back and midfield during his time at United, with his selfless attitude coming to the fore. “We have many good midfielders. Like I have said in many interviews, I will play wherever the coach wants to use me,” he said back in March 2023 when Erik ten Hag was short of options.",
      "Playing Martinez in midfield was raised back in November and Amorim’s response suggested he is not particularly keen on the idea. “I can't say,” he said when asked about the possibility. “I think a smart, intelligent football player can play in a lot of positions, but it is not the right position for him.",
      "“He needs more time to work there as he is not working there [currently]. But in one emergency he can play [there]. I am not thinking about that.”",
      "Casemiro will return from suspension for the Newcastle game, but Kobbie Mainoo will miss the game after injury struck at the worst possible time for the 20-year-old, who has been frustrated sitting on the bench all season.",
      "“I will see what we’re going to do,” Amorim said on Sunday. “I think Kobbie Mainoo is out and Bruno is out. So we will see. We are going to find solutions. No excuses. We need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.”",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are also on the sidelines with injuries, while Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui are away playing at the Africa Cup of Nations. The combination has left Amorim extremely short of options, especially considering his low opinion of the level of academy players.",
      "Nevertheless, the United boss has confirmed he won’t turn to the January transfer window to solve the crisis. “What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes,” Amorim said. “I’m not going to get [together] with [club chiefs] Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan.",
      "“If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in a moment where we need points but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”",

      "Gary Neville has tipped Lisandro Martinez to be an 'emergency replacement' for Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United. Since his transfer from Sporting Lisbon in 2020, the 31-year-old has been a constant presence for the Reds.",
      "However, it seems manager Ruben Amorim will have to manage without him for a while, following the United captain's hamstring injury during the first half of the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa. Remarkably, over a five-year period, Fernandes has only missed two matches due to injury.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo sidelined with a calf injury before the match at Villa Park and Casemiro suspended, Amorim had to think outside the box by fielding central defender Martinez alongside Manuel Ugarte. After the Argentine's impressive performance in midfield, Neville believes he could be a viable option in that position.",
      "On the Gary Neville podcast, the ex-United skipper said: \"At half-time, maybe I was thrown by the fact when Bruno Fernandes initially pulled up with his hamstring, he sent Joshua Zirkzee out to warm up. I thought, 'Yeah, that's right, because he can drop in.'",
      "\"I also liked the idea of having Mason Mount and Zirkzee behind Sesko, and Zirkzee and Sesko being potential threats from crosses, you've got running into the box, with Mount maybe dropping deeper and playing alongside Ugarte.",
      "\"When I saw Martinez come on, I thought 'How are United going to get a goal? How are they really going to pose a threat?' Now they didn't really pose a threat until that one chance Cunha got, which was a massive chance by the way.",
      "\"I would have liked to have seen Mount and Zirkzee off Sesko with Cunha floating in and around them. He didn't go for it, but I think Martinez, when he came on in the holding position, Villa did not put any real pressure on him.",
      "\"I thought he was good on the ball, I thought he was tidy. He did a good job in there. Maybe that's something that will have to happen.",
      "\"Although Casemiro will be back soon as well, so I don't think we will see him in there too much. But it's potentially one thing Amorim could do in an emergency if it happens over the Christmas period.\"",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo are both expected to miss the Boxing Day match against Newcastle United. Mainoo picked up a calf injury during training ahead of the Villa encounter.",
      "Casemiro will return from suspension, but the out-of-form Ugarte is the only other available central midfielder for the game against Eddie Howe's side. Nevertheless, Amorim made it clear Fernandes' injury will not change United's approach in the January transfer window.",
      "Speaking after the match, Amorim said: \"What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes. And then here we go again with a lot of mistakes. I'm not going to get with Jason under Omar and I'm going to say we need a lot of players because we have a plan.",
      "\"If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. Of course, you can feel that in this moment we are going to struggle, but we'll see.\"",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim are facing the prospect of entering 2026 without star player Bruno Fernandes, who suffered a muscle injury in Sunday's Premier League loss to Aston Villa. Fernandes sustained the injury towards the end of the first half at Villa Park and was substituted at half-time.",
      "Reports suggest that the United skipper could be sidelined for at least a month. \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while,\" Amorim revealed after the match.",
      "\"He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see. It's an injury and sometimes it's bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game. No one is going to remember these problems, so let's cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "The timing of Fernandes' injury is unfortunate, coming just days before the January transfer window opens, and calls for a new midfielder to be signed as a priority at Old Trafford are likely to intensify. However, Amorim has insisted that the club must avoid making any errors in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "\"We need to deal with that. What we cannot do is reach January and try to do everything with urgency and make mistakes again and be left saying 'here we go again',\" he stated.",
      "\"I am not going to go to Jason [Wilcox] and say we need a lot of players. If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we are going to continue with our plan. In this moment, you may feel we are going to struggle, but we will see.\"",
      "The impact of Fernandes' injury on United's transfer plans remains uncertain. With doubts surrounding Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro, a new midfielder was already high on their agenda, but the Fernandes problem has made the situation more urgent.",
      "Fortunately, United have the chance to replace the 31-year-old in the short term and address their midfield issues early in the transfer window. Ruben Neves is a name that has been consistently mentioned as a potential target for United, dating back to his time at Wolves.",
      "Now plying his trade at Al-Hilal, the 28-year-old is being linked with a return to the Premier League after turning down a new contract in Saudi Arabia. The Times has reported that Al-Hilal are resigned to losing him on a free transfer in the summer and are now open to selling him in January in an attempt to recoup some of the £47million they paid for him in 2023.",
      "A price tag of £18m has been suggested, but it's thought that clubs showing interest could secure the Portuguese star for significantly less, potentially offering United a bargain deal for the start of 2026. During his stint at Wolves, Neves made a name for himself as a reliable Premier League midfielder, renowned for his spectacular long-range goals.",
      "United's pursuit of players like Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, who carry price tags nearing £100m, means that more affordable alternatives will need to be explored this transfer window. Neves, potentially available for as little as £10m, could be the ideal first January signing.",

      "Ruben Amorim has already offered an explanation after appearing to upset Joshua Zirkzee during Manchester United's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa. The Dutchman came off the bench in the defeat but perhaps expected to be introduced earlier than he was.",
      "United found themselves trailing on the stroke of half-time during their trip to Villa Park after Morgan Rogers' sublime curling effort. Matheus Cunha levelled prior to the break, but Rogers added a second just before the hour mark and secured all three points for Unai Emery's side.",
      "A casualty of the loss was captain Bruno Fernandes, who suffered what appeared to be a hamstring injury during the first half but continued playing. Zirkzee was a frontrunner to replace him at the interval but United icon Gary Neville was \"surprised\" to see Lisandro Martinez come on in his place.",
      "Neville stated that Zirkzee looked upset at not being brought on at half-time, despite being introduced after 73 minutes, but Amorim provided an applicable explanation for a similar decision last season.",
      "\"I'm surprised as I thought Zirkzee would come on as he is closer to Fernandes' position,\" he said before adding: \"He [Zirkzee] doesn't look like he's too happy.\"",
      "But a not dissimilar situation occurred last campaign. Zirkzee started a tie against Newcastle in December 2024 but with United trailing 2-0 after 32 minutes, he was brought off the pitch and looked visibly distraught.",
      "Amorim explained after the match: \"You have to think about the team. The player is suffering during the game. We needed another midfielder. It was tough on me to do that. I talked with Joshua about that.",
      "\"I'm always thinking about the team. At that moment it was important for him to come out. I know that Josh is a really good guy. When he went to the tunnel, I can understand that some guys can be in a bad way but he is a really good lad.\"",
      "He added: \"It is life, and we will support Josh and continue. Newcastle were better than Manchester United. They weren't better than Josh.\"",
      "Neville also had his say during this controversial substitution, much like he did when Zirkzee was not introduced against Villa. He said: \"I know that he's earning a lot of money but there's a human being in there that's basically being cheered off by his home fans and that is brutal.\"",
      "Despite Amorim making decisions surrounding Zirkzee for the good of the team, the Dutchman continues to be linked with a move away from the club.",
      "Zirkzee was only signed in July 2024 from Bologna for £36.5million, but reports suggest he could make a swift return to Italy. Corriere dello Sport claim Roma are interested in Zirkee and the only thing currently preventing a transfer is a disparity on fees.",

      "The Red Devils captain's smile may not have lasted too long as Morgan Rogers' goals on either side of Mathues Cunha's effort ensured a 10th win in a row for Unai Emery's side. Fernandes was unable to add to his own impressive record against Villa, in the opening 45 minutes.",

      "It is a problem Manchester United have not really had to deal with, but one that Ruben Amorim is now faced with: what to do without Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes is not only United’s captain and talisman, but also a near ever-present. Since signing from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020, the playmaker has barely missed a game. He sat out of two matches at the end of the 2023/24 season with a knee complaint and, later, another due to illness. Otherwise he has been there, in almost every starting line-up, making 308 appearances and contributing 103 goals and 93 assists.",
      "Fernandes is inarguably United’s best and most consistent player. And he is arguably the most important player for any Premier League side, such is his complete and utter dominance of Amorim’s team. And now he’s unavailable.",
      "For how long, we don’t yet know. Amorim said he will likely “lose some games” after being forced off at half-time against Aston Villa on Sunday. Diogo Dalot described his absence – for Boxing Day’s game against Newcastle at least – as “massive”, with Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui away at the Africa Cup of Nations and Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt also injured.",
      "Massive just about covers it. The January transfer window is just around the corner, but Amorim has already warned against panic-buying to find cover for their skipper. “I will see what we’re going to do,” Amorim said post-match. “I think Kobbie Mainoo is out and Bruno is out. So we will see. We are going to find solutions. No excuses. We need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.",
      "“What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes. I’m not going to get [together] with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox] and [chief executive] Omar [Berrada] and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan. If we have to suffer, the club comes first.”",
      "What is that plan? Well, Amorim is at least boosted by the return from suspension of Casemiro, who sat out of the 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa after picking up a fifth yellow card of the campaign. The experienced Brazilian will no doubt return as the more defensively-minded midfielder, but the identity of his partner is unclear.",
      "Mainoo’s injury is extremely badly timed. The 20-year-old has been frustratedly sitting on the bench all season and the moment an opportunity comes, he is unavailable. Amorim has said he sees Mainoo as a more attack-minded midfielder and he might have been a good fit for the Newcastle game.",
      "A look at United’s first-team squad on their own website shows just how thin on the ground they are right now. With Fernandes and Mainoo injured and Toby Collyer and Dan Gore away on loan, that leaves Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount as the only fit first-team midfielders.",
      "Choosing two of those three looks straightforward, with Mount the best replacement for Fernandes. The former Chelsea man has tended to play as one of the No.10s in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation, but can drop back into the midfield two and has the creative instincts to push forward.",
      "Ugarte, meanwhile, is completely lacking in such instincts and has been an underwhelming flop since making a £50million move from Paris Saint-Germain in August 2024. Shockingly, United have not won any of the last nine league games in which Ugarte has started.",
      "Amorim turned to Lisandro Martinez to play the second half in midfield against Villa and the returning Argentina international did a reasonable job. But the defender clearly isn’t a like-for-like replacement and can’t play alongside Casemiro; instead he could return in defence, perhaps in place of Ayden Heaven.",
      "The final option for Amorim comes from the academy – an area he has been accused of ignoring since arriving over a year ago. Indeed, Amorim referenced Sunday’s two debutants as options at Villa Park: “I think [Jack] Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, [Shea] Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.”",
      "Lacey is a wide forward who showed a glimpse of his talent by cutting inside off the right onto his left foot and getting a shot off against Villa. Fletcher – the son of ex-United midfielder Darren Fletcher – is a central midfielder who could earn more minutes in the coming games. But throwing him into the starting line-up against Newcastle’s Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton is a big step up and one Amorim is unlikely to take.",

      "Ruben Amorim does not want to see Manchester United panic and make mistakes in the January transfer window following the injury to Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese midfielder was forced off from the field during defeat to Aston Villa.",
      "United's boss does not want the club to hastily adjust their plans with a knee-jerk reaction and revealed he would not be demanding new players from Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada. The 40-year-old instead wants the club to stick to their long-term plan.",
      "They have been linked with signing a new central midfielder after failing to persuade Brighton to part ways with Carlos Baleba in the summer. The club have since been linked with the likes of Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson.",
      "But Antoine Semenyo has been the most prominent name ahead of the January transfer window. The Bournemouth star has a £65million release clause and has the interest of Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham, and United.",
      "Amorim is adamant that the Red Devils will not repeat the mistakes of the past by acting rashly. Even if that means suffering in the short term.",
      "“What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes,\" Amorim said. “I’m not going to get [together] with Jason and Omar and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan.",
      "“If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in a moment where we need points but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan.",
      "\"You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”",
      "Amorim's comments come days after suggesting United may have some financial backing for January. On that occasion, he emphasised any deal would benefit a prolonged period rather than cover for the club's AFCON losses.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said. \"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",
      "\"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. \"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "\"We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",

      "Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes is set to be sidelined for at least a month after picking up an injury during his team's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. The Portuguese midfielder was visibly struggling throughout the opening 45 minutes, with a substitution forcing him off at half-time.",
      "Now, according to The Telegraph, the club captain suffered a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", forcing him to be withdrawn at the interval at Villa Park. Fernandes' injury couldn't have come at a worse moment for United, with key players Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui all currently away representing their countries at the Africa Cup of Nations over the coming weeks.",
      "This has already left Ruben Amorim working with a depleted squad, something that was apparent in his reliance on younger talent during Sunday's disappointing result, as he called on the likes of Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher from the bench. Losing Fernandes represents a massive setback, particularly given his vital contribution to their recent improved performances, netting five times and providing seven assists from his deeper midfield position.",
      "Discussing the injury following the match, Amorim said: \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while. He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see. It's an injury and sometimes it's bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game. No one is going to remember these problems, so let's cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo might finally get his moment, following demands from supporters across all corners for the youngster to be handed his opportunity, as well as the public t-shirt stunt from his brother. The academy star is yet to start a Premier League match this campaign, despite having already demonstrated his capabilities at the top - featuring for England as well as scoring an FA Cup winner for United.",
      "Mainoo was missing from the Villa Park defeat due to a minor knock sustained during training, preventing him from being the immediate replacement for Fernandes on Sunday, though he could feature in the Boxing Day encounter with Newcastle United. “I will see,\" Amorim responded when asked if the midfielder could feature in the coming week.",
      "\"I think Kobbie Mainoo is out, but we will see. We are going to find solutions. No excuses, we need to win the next game and we are going to try to win the next game.”",
      "With another fitness concern emerging, Amorim faces some crucial fixtures over the coming weeks that may see the skipper sidelined. Given United's final realistic shot at silverware lies in the FA Cup, losing Fernandes for the upcoming Brighton fixture could prove devastating, alongside his potential absence for clashes against rivals including Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",
      "Fernandes has been typically reliable for minutes since joining United in 2020, with this being a rare occasion where he will miss out. The club captain already has over 300 appearances to his name, with 103 goals and 93 assists, showing how huge his absence could be.",
      "That said, it could be a peak into a post-Fernandes world for United and Amorim, just days on from an interview on his future. \"I've always said that I want to remain in a place for as long as I'm wanted,\" he said.",
      "\"The moment I feel that I'm not 100% wanted, then I will talk to the club and say that I want to leave. I would like to try the Spanish league because I've never played in Spain. I would like to play for one of the clubs in Italy that competes for big aims like the league title, especially because I really enjoyed living in Italy.\"",

      "Spanish media have reached a verdict after Marcus Rashford was dropped to the bench for Barcelona's win over Villarreal on Sunday. The on-loan Manchester United forward was benched by Hansi Flick, having started a cup tie in midweek.",
      "The reigning La Liga champions are putting up a valiant defence of their crown and faced Villarreal away from home in their latest league tie. Rivals and second-place Real Madrid had played on Saturday, beating Sevilla 2-0.",
      "Rashford's side faced a difficult task when they travelled to Estadio de la Ceramica, and head coach Flick preferred to hand Raphinha a starting role instead of the Englishman. This decision paid dividends as the superstar Brazilian opened the scoring after 12 minutes before Lamine Yamal's clincher just after the hour mark.",
      "Media outlets in Spain have now had their say regarding Rashford, who came off the bench in the 63rd minute in place of Fermin Lopez and enjoyed some space out wide.",
      "Rashford had a few shots on goal in his time on the pitch, but his biggest moment came in the 89th minute. He was played in one-on-one with the goalkeeper but his chipped effort was cleared off the line by Sergi Cardona.",
      "Marca were somewhat critical of the miss and wrote: \"Barça combined very quickly in the attacking third. Rashford was one-on-one with [Luiz] Junior, he chipped it but it was weak and allowed Cardona to collect the ball in the six-yard box.\"",
      "But their player ratings painted a different picture, describing him as \"dangerous.\" They also said: \"He came on in the 62nd minute. The Englishman always gives the impression of being very dangerous and only Cardona prevented him from scoring.\"",
      "The decision to supplant United loanee Rashford with the now-fit Raphinha was hailed by outlet Sport, who give the 28-year-old a lot of credit but believe his counterpart adds something extra.",
      "Sport wrote: \"No one can complain about Rashford's performance during Raphinha's absence [midweek], but the truth is the Brazilian provides an extra dimension defensively and has an essential work rate.\"",
      "They rated Rashford a 7/10 for his performance from the bench against Villarreal though and were in agreement that he was a dangerous player once introduced.",
      "Sport added: \"He's much more comfortable with space, exploiting it with long runs and powerful dribbles. He was generous in switching flanks and constantly offering solutions, always at the service of the team. His commitment and dedication were complete.\"",
      "This outlet also saw eye-to-eye with others and had nothing but praise for Rashford and how he played. AS also singled out Rashford's speed and powerful dribbling as defining attributes. They wrote: \"He used his power and speed to do a lot of damage from the left flank.\"",
      "AS continued: \"To begin with, the German manager substituted Fermín and Ferran [Torres] in the second half, bringing on [Robert] Lewandowski and Rashford. That's what happens when you have that kind of squad depth.",
      "\"But it wasn't either of those two players who decided the match. It was Lamine Yamal who pounced on a series of rebounds in the Villarreal penalty area to score the second goal that sealed the victory.\"",
      "Rashford was hailed as a \"potential game changer\" by Mundo Deportivo who like most of the media in Spain only took positives from his appearance off the bench.",
      "Using one word to sum up his match, they wrote: \"Refreshing.\" They added: \"His speed was his best asset. [Tajon] Buchanan had to grab him during a run, which earned him a yellow card.",
      "\"He had a clear chance to score, but his finishing wasn't quite there. He gave the team an attacking spark. We can't forget Raphinha's sensational performance too, as he brings speed, pressure and infectious intensity to Barça.",
      "\"And we can't forget Lamine, who tries everything and scored a goal that provided some breathing room in a crucial match for this league campaign, even though it's still only the first half of the season.\"",

      "A Morgan Rogers brace saw United fall to a 2-1 loss as Matheus Cunha got on the scoresheet. Amorim's side have now recorded just two wins in eight Premier League matches.",

There's too many players, like Dalot, that just don't do enough.",

      "Gary Neville believes Manuel Ugarte was rescued by teammate Ayden Heaven on two occasions during the early stages of Manchester United's Premier League match with Aston Villa. The Red Devils travelled to Villa Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "During the opening exchanges in the West Midlands, Morgan Rogers threatened to break the deadlock on several occasions, before ultimately doing so just before the interval with a strike from distance into the far corner.",
      "Before the breakthrough, the hosts' most promising opportunities arose from careless possession in the midfield, particularly from Ugarte. He required assistance from his colleagues on multiple occasions, with Heaven producing an impressive early showing, alongside goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "\"The problem with having Manuel Ugarte in a deep-lying position is that he's not very good on the ball, and there is an example of it. Ayden Heaven just gets that second block in that's absolutely crucial.\"",
      "Thankfully for United, despite going a goal down, Matheus Cunha dragged Ruben Amorim's team back onto level pegging just moments after they had fallen behind. Matty Cash lost possession in a precarious area to Patrick Dorgu, and the ball eventually found its way to Cunha, who confidently slotted it into the far corner from close range.",
      "They were not level for long, though. Rogers scored his and Villa's second just before the hour mark.",
      "In the aftermath of that goal, Ugarte made way for Joshua Zirkzee. That was part of a double substitution that saw Jack Fletcher come on to make his debut, replacing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Ugarte's withdrawal also came soon after the midfielder received his first yellow card of the season. He was starting just his fourth match of the season, and first since the 3-1 loss to Brentford in late September.",
      "United desperately needed three points to maintain their pursuit of Chelsea and Liverpool in the battle for top-four qualification. Victory would have drawn them level with their competitors on points after 17 matches.",
      "Villa, however, had been in exceptional form recently and arrived on the back of a nine-match winning streak heading into the weekend's fixture. Their most recent loss came at Anfield against Liverpool towards the end of November.",
      "However, they had subsequently defeated teams including Arsenal, Bournemouth, and West Ham United. It came as little surprise, then, that Unai Emery's outfit sought to establish an early tempo against Amorim's charges and exploit Ugarte.",

      "Even more worryingly, Bruno Fernandes went off at half-time after stretching out his leg and if he is out for any time then you fear for a United team already missing Bryan Mbeumo and Amad who are away on AFCON duty. You might have thought it could be a chance for Kobbie Mainoo but he missed the trip to Villa Park because of a calf injury.",
      "A cynic might be suspicious that his absence came just a few days after his brother wore a “Free Kobbie Mainoo” T-shirt in protest at his continued absence from the United starting line-up. But surely no manager would cut off their nose to spite their face.",
      "Ruben Amorim also needs every bit of help he can get. Another blank for £74m striker Benjamin Sesko who has yet to get going at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim cut a frustrated figure as he threw on youngsters Shea Lacey and also Jack Fletcher - son of ex-United midfielder Darren who is still on the staff - for his senior debut. But even as Villa tired, United just could not find a way back.",
      "Rogers reigned supreme again as he just looks unstoppable right now. For club and country.",
      "Is Morgan Rogers currently the best player in the Premier League? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "His first goal lit up the whole game because after Villa’s fast start, it had faded away. Then Rogers struck. John McGinn sent over a long ball, Rogers’ heavy touch nearly let it run out of play but he showed all his pace and determination to keep it in.",
      "Rogers then darted in from the left wing, cut inside and then curled a sensational shot into the top corner to give Villa the lead on 45 minutes. But, within three minutes and deep into first half injury time, United levelled.",
      "Matty Cash found himself under pressure, Patrick Dorgu got a touch to Cunha who steadied himself and then made a smart finish into the far corner. Villa were ahead again after 57 minutes.",
      "Youri Tielemans put the ball across, Ollie Watkins could not control it and then Rogers latched on and curled another brilliant shot into the far corner. Another Christmas cracker from Rogers. Sheer brilliance. Somehow Cunha headed wide from Dorgu’s cross to level again and Villa held on.",
      "United will play worse and win. This was not a day for an Amorim crisis but it was a game which highlighted the reliance on Fernandes, a growing list of absences and also Sesko’s continual struggles. In contrast, after Villa’s worst start in 28 years which left them in utter disarray, they now have an incredible and wonderful momentum.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Morgan Rogers was the star of the show as Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park. The victory makes it 10 in a row for Unai Emery's side, who are keeping pace with Arsenal and Manchester City at the top.",
      "A special strike from Rogers opened the scoring on the brink of half-time. But it was quickly cancelled out by Matheus Cunha in rather fortuitous circumstances after an early Christmas present from Matty Cash.",
      "With Bruno Fernandes going off injured at the interval, United were weakened and Rogers took advantage by scoring his and Villa's second goal before the hour mark. Ruben Amorim's toothless attack were unable to draw level and saw their four-game unbeaten run come to an end.",
      "Here are five talking points from Villa Park.",
      "With Casemiro suspended, there was a good chance that Kobbie Mainoo would finally start his first Premier League game of the season. But when team news was confirmed, the 20-year-old was conspicuous by his absence.",
      "As it turns out, Mainoo injured his calf during training on Saturday and it wasn't some form of punishment by Amorim. A storm erupted this week after Mainoo's half-brother wore a t-shirt to Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth emblazoned with the text 'Free Kobbie Mainoo'.",
      "Who else to open the scoring? Rogers has now scored six goals in his last six league games since the November international break.",
      "His luscious effort to break the deadlock against the run of play was the pick of the bunch, too. Collecting the ball on the left flank, Rogers glided inside and took on Leny Yoro before unleashing a curling strike into Senne Lammens' top-right corner.",
      "United's goalkeeper didn't even move. For Rogers' second, he beat Yoro again and produced a similar albeit less spectacular strike which Lammens had no chance of stopping.",
      "It'll take something unwelcome or someone special for Rogers not to be starting for England at the World Cup. Cole Palmer and Jude Bellingham have their work cut out.",
      "United probably owe Cash a Christmas card. In May, his weak backpass led to Emi Martinez's sending off in a moment that changed the course of the teams' last meeting, a 2-0 win for the Red Devils.",
      "This time, the Poland international dawdled on the ball and was caught by the pressing of Patrick Dorgu. The ball fell kindly to Cunha, whose first-time finish ripped past Martinez.",
      "United, who'd dominated parts of the first half, were level just three minutes after conceding. But there was a concern, with Bruno Fernandes clutching his hamstring on multiple occasions before the break.",
      "It's not often you see Fernandes nursing an injury and even rarer to see him being substituted because of one. But a hamstring problem forced United's captain off at half-time and he was replaced by Lisandro Martinez, brought on to play in an unconventional midfield role.",
      "The Red Devils had less of a goal threat with the enforced changed, perhaps a sign of things to come. With the always hectic festive period ahead, and with both Bryan Mbeumo and Amad at the Africa Cup of Nations, Fernandes' prolonged absence would be sorely felt.",
      "A lot has been said about the Red Devils' academy in recent weeks, much of it by Amorim. But the United manager put his faith in youth by firstly subbing on Jack Fletcher, the son of ex-United star Darren.",
      "There was another debut soon after, as the highly rated Shae Lacey entered proceedings in the closing stages. But there were no dream debuts, as Villa saw out the win.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has handed Manchester United an injury blow during his side's game at Aston Villa on Sunday, coming off with a hamstring complaint.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were in desperate need of a result heading into Sunday's clash at Villa Park, not least to keep the pace with top four rivals Liverpool and Chelsea. A win in the Midlands would take them level on 29 points, while a draw would leave them two points adrift.",
      "It was a lively start to the game, with Villa close to scoring through Morgan Rogers on occasion. United also had chances through Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The deadlock was eventually broken on the brink of half-time as Rogers did get his goal, cutting inside and firing a rocket into the net from just inside the box. But Villa's lead was short-lived as United got back on level terms almost instantly as Matty Cash was dispossessed close to the United goal and Cunha found the far corner.",
      "It can be argued the scoreline was the least of United's concerns, however, as captain Fernandes appeared to pull up late in the first-half. He was able to play on until the whistle, but was clearly in some discomfort as the players made their way to the dressing room.",
      "Therefore, it was no surprise to see Amorim make a change at the break. There were limited options on the bench, with both Joshua Zirkzee and Lisandro Martinez the only two senior outfield players available.",
      "It was Martinez who got the nod, with Fernandes then pictured with his coat on making his way back to the bench before kick-off. It was a bitter flow for the Red Devils as their captain has arguably been one of their most consistent performers this term.",
      "Interestingly, pundit and former United defender Gary Neville was a little surprised by Amorim's decision to take a more defensive approach with his change. Speaking on commentary, he questioned why it was Martinez instead of Zirkzee who was called upon for the second 45 minutes.",
      "\"I am surprised because I thought Zirkzee would come on just because he is closer to Bruno's position,\" Neville argued. \"I am quite surprised.",
      "\"Zirkzee doesn't look like he is too happy with it either, but you can see there now Martinez has gone in there alongside (Manuel) Ugarte in central midfield. He played there for Ajax a few times as well, United now have a back five and Ugarte and Martinez in front.",
      "\"It was a real shock to see Bruno pull up with his hamstring because he is ever present and hardly misses a game.\"",
      "It took a little over ten minutes into the second half, but Villa were able to restore their lead to make it 2-1. Rogers, once again, found the net for the hosts with another curled effort into the far corner."

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic played under four different managers during his Old Trafford spell. Jose Mourinho brought him to Old Trafford, but it was the Portuguese's successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who Matic believes was dismissed too early.",
      "Solskjaer replaced Mourinho in December 2019, initially on an interim basis before being appointed permanently. He was the second United boss of Matic's five years at Old Trafford, eventually losing his job in 2021",
      "Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick spent time in interim charge after Solskjaer's dismissal, which came after a 4-1 loss at Watford left United seventh in the Premier League. Reflecting on the Norwegian's stint four years later, though, Matic argued United pulled the trigger too soon.",
      "“We finished second and third under him. There was an atmosphere in the team that we weren’t happy finishing second, but when you see the results now, we did amazingly,\" Matic told FourFourTwo",
      "“I think Ole deserved more time – and when I say Ole, I also want to mention his staff, like Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. They were going the right way to bring United back.",
      "“Of course, they made the decision to sack Ole based on his final couple of results, but he was an amazing person with the right profile for the club. He and his assistants understood football – training was perfect and had every little detail ready for us.\"",
      "Matic praised Solskjaer, in part for how he was able to keep players on board even when they weren't playing regularly. The Serbian started just four of United's 12 league games in his final season, but recognised the manager was someone who knew the club.",
      "Matic would go on to leave Old Trafford in the summer of 2022, linking back up with Mourinho at Roma. He then spent time in France, playing for Rennes and Lyon, and is now back in Italy with Sassuolo.",
      "Solskjaer took time out after leaving United, eventually ending his exile from management when he took over at Besiktas midway through the 2024/25 season. He was dismissed by the Turkish club in August, though, and spoke in November about a potential return to the dugout.",
      "\"I'm open, it's not like I'm desperate to be back but England, I love living here, I think so,\" he told Stick to Football. \"My kids ask me mid-Championship and up, but I’m a football man.

      "Manchester United's skipper Bruno Fernandes reportedly has a release clause in his contract that is only applicable to clubs outside the Premier League. Since joining from Sporting in January 2020 for just under £50million, the Portuguese midfielder has become a key player for the Red Devils.",
      "He was appointed captain by ex-manager Erik ten Hag in 2023 and has since racked up over 300 appearances for the club. Under the guidance of Ruben Amorim this season, Fernandes has netted five goals and provided seven assists in his 17 outings across all competitions.",
      "His importance to the team is undeniable, but there was a chance he might not have been at Old Trafford this season if certain members of United's top brass had their way last summer.",
      "Earlier this month, Fernandes dropped a bombshell, revealing that some were trying to push him out of the club during the previous transfer window after a hefty offer came in from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "Despite the prospect of a significant salary increase, Fernandes chose to stay at Old Trafford, with Amorim also keen to retain him, despite apparent opposition from higher up.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,\" he recently confessed to Canal 11. \"I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, I always play, good or bad.",
      "\"I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "Following the interview, which has once again cast doubt over Fernandes' future at Old Trafford, it has now come to light that the midfielder may have an exit clause written into his deal.",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, the clause can only be activated by clubs outside England. \"There is a release clause in the contract of Bruno Fernandes,\" Romano revealed in his latest YouTube video.",
      "\"And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It's only for clubs abroad. It is slightly over €60million (£52.5m). So, nothing is imminent.",
      "\"Nothing is happening. For the summer transfer window, I would keep an eye on the interest from Saudi because I think from Saudi, they can return for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"Then it's going to be up to Bruno, up to Man Utd again. Let's see what's going to happen before or after the World Cup.\"",

      "Sunday, December 21, 2025, will forever be a special day for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey, regardless of Manchester United's defeat at Aston Villa. The 18-year-olds will never forget their professional debuts, especially coming for United on a big Premier League stage.",
      "It's an interesting time for two academy graduates to be adding their names to a historic list of youngsters making the step up to the first team as well. Ruben Amorim threw them both on at Villa Park with resources stretched to breaking point, and he did so having been critical of the academy in recent weeks.",
      "The relationship between Amorim and those nurturing the stars of the future could be strained after recent comments, with the head coach not always giving the impression he was happy with the quality or the attitude of those being developed.",
      "However, in the West Midlands, he demonstrated that he was still willing to turn to them when needed. Fletcher came on with 17 minutes remaining and Lacey got the final six minutes, having been an unused substitute on four occasions recently. Both can be happy with their brief cameos.",
      "There could be more opportunities to come. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day, but United will be without seven first-team players, with Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo all set to be out. That could hand more squad places to academy kids.",
      "As good as Fletcher and Lacey might be feeling this morning, however, they have been warned that making their debuts is far from the end of the road and after Amorim's recent comments, they will know hard times could be ahead as well. Even for the best players, the path is very rarely smooth.",
      "That is the point Amorim made a week ago when he cited the debuts handed out to Harry Amass and Chido Obi last season, who played for United at the ages of 18 and 17, but now find themselves going through different periods. Amass is playing well for a struggling Championship side and Chido is having a more difficult season at academy level.",
      "Both players reacted badly to those comments, posting photos on Instagram of successful moments in recent months, only to then delete them. Amorim was unflinching in his criticism last week, but made the valid point that it can be dangerous to cosset young players and that sometimes they need to go through tougher spells as part of their development.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids,\" he said. \"We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "Those are words that Fletcher and Lacey should remember. A month from now, the injured players are likely to return, and the Africa Cup of Nations trio of Mazraoui, Amad, and Mbeumo will be back. With a fully fit squad to pick from, Amorim won't be calling on Fletcher or Lacey.",
      "They have had a taste of first-team football for one of the world's biggest clubs, but very soon they will be playing academy football again or having a loan spell in the EFL. When that happens, they should take Amorim's comments on board. They have enjoyed a memorable day in their young careers, but the hard work has barely even begun.",

      "Manchester United are unlikely to sanction a January departure for Joshua Zirkzee until their injury crisis has eased or key players have returned from the Africa Cup of Nations. Roma are keen to sign the forward next month as Gian Piero Gasperini looks to strengthen his attacking options.",
      "A deal isn't thought to be as advanced as reports in Italy have suggested over the previous 24 hours, but the Serie A giants are keen to sign Zirkzee during the window as they explore a loan or permanent deal. Even if a move was to accelerate, United are reluctant to lose an attacking option at a point when their resources are so stretched. Zirkzee came on for the final 17 minutes against Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "United lost Kobbie Mainoo to a calf injury in training on Saturday and then saw Bruno Fernandes limp off at half-time at Villa Park. Both players will miss the Boxing Day clash against Newcastle and while there is hope Mainoo could be fit for the clash with Wolves, Ruben Amorim expects Fernandes to miss a few games.",
      "That is a blow when he is already without attacking options in Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, who are away with the Ivory Coast and Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). It means the only true attacking options available to Amorim are Zirkzee, Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo's absence will depend on how far their nations get in AFCON, but they are both among the favourites and the final weekend of the tournament is played on January 17 and 18. Amorim will give an update on Fernandes' fitness at his press conference on Christmas Eve to preview the clash with Newcastle.",
      "United are working on an attacking signing in January as they eye up a move for Antoine Semenyo. The Bournemouth forward has a £65million release clause in his contract, but United face competition from Manchester City and Liverpool for the 25-year-old.",
      "That clause is only active in the first couple of weeks of the window, so any deal could happen quickly. Should United land Semenyo, it could also free up the possibility of Zirkzee then joining Roma.",
      "Zirkzee, 24, has struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford since his £36.5million move from Bologna in July 2024. He has managed just eight goals and three assists in 60 games for the club and has started just 17 Premier League games.",

      "Discussing Sesko in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: \"He is returning to competition, really fast, he is going to improve a lot, the idea was 70-75 [minutes], he stopped for a while, we are trying to help the players.\"",
      "When discussing whether United conceded similar goals at Villa Park, Amorim defended Yoro and Heaven, saying: \"Sometimes we can suffer goals and concede. When you want to press and they kick the ball, Rogers can go both sides, it is really hard to defend a player like that one against one.",
      "\"We had some games against Nottingham Forest, Ayden [Heaven] and Leny [Yoro] defend one against one most of the time, Luke Shaw is the same. It is not just if you suffer goals, but the way. Sometimes the details can change the narrative.\"",
      "United had the opportunity to move up to fifth in the table with a victory against Villa, but they will head into the Boxing Day game against Newcastle sitting in seventh position in the league.",
      "Amorim will be without Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury in the first half of the game. \"I think it's soft tissue so it's going to be a while. We'll see,\" the United boss said.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could return to face Newcastle, he added: \"Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out, so we'll see. No excuses, we'll try to win the next game.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes was captured on camera responding Aston Villa fans from the dugout during Manchester United's Premier League defeat on Sunday. The Portuguese international had taken his spot amongst the substitutes after sustaining an injury during the match, which led to his withdrawal.",
      "With his hood pulled up and Villa supporters jeering, Fernandes could be seen turning towards them and attempting to silence them. \"You sing more for me than for your team,\" he declared.",
      "\"Don't be angry because I score always against you,\" he continued with a grin, reports the Mirror. Villa supporters responded with a mocking cheer as Fernandes was ushered back to his seat by a United staff member and turned to face the pitch.",
      "The United skipper's grin may not have endured much longer as Morgan Rogers' strikes either side of Matheus Cunha's effort secured a 10th consecutive victory for Unai Emery's team.",
      "Fernandes was unable to enhance his own remarkable record against Villa during the first half. The 31-year-old has netted more goals against the Midlands outfit than any other opposition.",
      "United's talisman has found the net seven times in 13 outings and contributed three assists. He had little reason to smile following the defeat and did not receive encouraging news regarding his fitness.",
      "Fernandes could be sidelined for a month. \"It's a soft tissue, I think he's going to lose some games,\" said Ruben Amorim after the game against Villa. \"I don't know for sure. Let's see. I don't know. I don't what to talk about matters you can't control.",
      "\"He is a guy who is always fit, so he might recover quite well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out. We will see. No excuses, we need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.\"",
      "Despite Fernandes' absence, Gary Neville believes United were the superior side against Villa. The former club captain was encouraged by the display from Amorim's team.",
      "\"I thought it was a really good performance, but the details of the two goals have cost them,\" he said. \"Now that's going to continue to happen whilst they don't have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don't have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "\"I don't think they are anywhere near good enough to get into that top three, but what I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things.",
      "\"One, the manager has changed, quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change – the five or the three at the back, the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front – has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That's a good thing.\"",

      "The January transfer window is now almost upon us, and Manchester United look set to be right in the mix once again as clubs across the Premier League prepare their bids and sales.",
      "At the forefront of United’s wishlist is Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo, whose £65m release clause will be active in the first two weeks of the window. United are among several top sides tracking the Ghanaian attacker, and recent reports suggest Tottenham have thrown their name in the hat alongside potential moves to Old Trafford or Manchester City.",
      "Behind the scenes, there’s continued speculation that Ruben Amorim wants reinforcements in midfield, with links to players like Ruben Neves and Conor Gallagher gaining traction as alternatives to more expensive options.",
      "United’s injury challenges, including the latest setback to captain Bruno Fernandes, emphasise why January business might be crucial, even as Amorim insists he won’t panic buy and will stick to long-term recruitment plans.",
      "Stay tuned with the latest United transfer news and rumours throughout the morning here....",
      "Manchester United are reportedly holding 'internal meetings' to find solutions regarding Bruno Fernandes' recent injury and Kobbie Mainoo's unceratin future, according to SullyTalkz on X.",
      "The club have been linked with a series of midfield options including Elliot Anderson, Conor Gallagher, and Carlos Baleba. It looks as though midfield reinforcements will be a critical zone for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Manchester United transfer target Breno Bidon has caught fresh attention from across Europe following a standout performance for Corinthians in the recent Copa do Brasil final.",
      "The 20-year-old’s ability to dominate in high-pressure games has impressed scouts from Atletico Madrid and Sporting Lisbon, according to reports from Brazil, via SportsWitness.",
      "United have been tracking Bidon closely, but his signature won't come cheap. While the midfielder carries a massive £87m release clause, Corinthians are reportedly open to bids around the £17m mark.",
      "Manchester United-linked forward Karim Adeyemi has been fined by Borussia Dortmund for his behaviour after being substituted during their 2-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach.",
      "Adeyemi, who is reportedly wanted by United, was withdrawn after an hour with Dortmund leading 1-0 on Friday night. The 23-year-old walked past the home dugout before appearing to head towards the tunnel.",
      "Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl then intervened to exchange some words before directing him towards the bench. \"I told him; 'You're not going to the locker room, sit down', and to be honest the substitution was partly justified,\" Kehl said after the game. \"Karim didn't have a good game...\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is facing at least one month out of action after suffering from an injury in his side's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.",
      "That's according to The Telegraph, who report that the club captain sustained a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", which saw him forced off at half-time at Villa Park.",
      "Italian newspaper Il Messaggero have reported that Man United would only let Joshua Zirkzee depart the club in mid to late January, when Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will be back from AFCON.",
      "AS Roma are keen to sign the forward, though they are also considering Atletico Madrid's Giacomo Raspadori. The Serie A side have put forward an inital loan fee worth €5m and an option to buy of €30m, although United are said to be keen on €50m.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Liverpool are prepared to stop pursuing Antoine Semenyo, which would put the winger in a more favourable position to sign for Manchester United.",
      "United want to bring Semenyo to Old Trafford in January but face competition from a number of Premier League rivals, with Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool said last week to among them.",
      "But if Liverpool now drop out of the race for the Ghana international, it would give United a major boost to get a deal over the deal.",
      "If Antoine Semenyo were to sign for Manchester United, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has suggested his arrival would be directly linked to Joshua Zirkzee's exit.",
      "The Dutchman has been left frustrated with his lack of game time this season and in a World Cup year, he is open leaving United in January. A return to Serie A is being discussed and progress on a potential move to Roma is moving fast.",
      "Manchester United have made a 'significant effort' to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth and have presented what is described as an impressive package that includes substantial terms and a key role under Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "United are 'serious' about signing Semenyo and the club has explained its vision to the player about how he would sit into their system.",
      "According to transfer journalist Matteo Moretto, Roma want to add Joshua Zirkzee to their squad in the first week of January, and it's claimed they are 'nearing an agreement with Manchester United'.",
      "While it was previously revealed that United do not want to lose Zirkzee before January 18 due to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), this date has now moved forward three days.",
      "Zirkzee is thought to have 'expressed his appreciation' for a move to Rome, with the Serie A club aiming to complete a loan transfer with an option to buy.",
      "Marcus Rashford is closing in on a permanent move to Barcelona. The Catalan club is 'inclined' on signing the 28-year-old for good once his loan move expires, according to Mundo Deportivo.",
      "Rashford has impressed since he signed for Barca on loan in July and the club are said to be pleased with his progress. He has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances so far this season.",
      "According to the Times, Brighton are not planning on selling Carlos Baleba until at least 2027, damaging Manchester United's chances of signing the Cameroon international next year.",
      "An approach from United for Baleba was rejected during the summer, and the club was informed that a bid of more than £100million was required for Brighton to even consider a sale.",
      "But Brighton are now prepared to hold on to Baleba for at least another 18 months, even if United decide to dip back into the market and attempt to sign him in 2026.",
      "Bayern Munich have been preparing to offer £43.8m for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, it has been claimed.",
      "Bayern are described as long-term admirers of Fernandes, but may need to wait to determine if he will be fit by the end of January or if they will have to postpone their plans until the summer.",

      "Gary Neville has torn into Manchester United defender Leny Yoro for the way Aston Villa ace Morgan Rogers got past him.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side fought valiantly against the Midlanders, but two moments of individual genius from Rogers saw Unai Emery's side run out 2-1 winners at Villa Park. On two occasions, Rogers whipped a right-footed effort into the far corner, leaving Senne Lammens with no chance.",
      "Unfortunately for Yoro who was deployed as a right-central defender, Rogers got the better of him on both occasions. Neville picked the young Frenchman out and made it clear he did not do enough to stop the Villa hitman from scoring.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast, Neville said: \"The first goal, I’ve got less sympathy for Leny Yoro. I actually thought as the ball went over his head, it was a difficult one for him to control as he runs towards the touchline.",
      "\"I’m thinking, as Rogers has turned his back and he runs towards the touchline, ‘Yoro, get after him. Sprint, harass him, hurry him!’ If you’re Morgan Rogers and I am Leny Yoro, you have to stand on the point of his right foot, so he cannot get across you.",
      "\"You can’t just say, ‘Show him down the line and then let him go across you.’ You have to show him knowing he can’t go back on his right foot, because that’s what he wants to do, but also you’re not showing him enough so he goes into the space.",
      "\"You always need to be threatening his right foot while you’re guiding him down the line and Leny Yoro did not do that. It was a big mistake in the game for him.",
      "\"He’s a young defender and he’ll pick it up, but I was surprised. If you’re doing your homework before the match and you’re a right-sided centre-back and you’re going to end up in the right-back position, which he did the other night against Semenyo against Bournemouth,",
      "\"He’s played that role twice now. He’s had to go out there, almost like a right-back. You have to think about before the game ‘What’s my picture of the match? What does my match look like?’\"",
      "In the 84th minute, Yoro was substituted for academy star Shea Lacey, as United searched for an equaliser. Amorim has previously said the ex-Lille defender allows individual mistakes to weigh on his mind too much.",
      "Neville went on to put himself into Yoro's shoes, by looking back at one player he tied him in knots when he was a youngster at United. Neville added: \"I used to think, 'Who am I playing against?’",
      "\"I remember getting done by David Ginola at Newcastle. He could go both ways and I was cutting off his left foot, thinking he is going to go that way and he went back onto his right and swung it into the far corner.",
      "\"It happens to everybody, but I think Yoro could have made it a lot harder for Morgan Rogers and he’s predictably going to go onto his right foot, he’s not two-footed in the sense he’s going to go onto his left and swing it in.”",

      "Reports in Germany had previously suggested that Jorge Mendes - Adeyemi's agent - had held talks with United in November over a possible move to England. His current deal in Germany expires in 2027, and talks are ongoing over an extension that will include a £70.2 million release clause.",
      "However, the weekend's incident has left a bad taste at Dortmund, and Dietmar Hamann pulled no punches in his assessment of Adeyemi's reaction to being substituted by Niko Kovac. \"These indiscipline issues have crept in over the last few weeks,\" the former Liverpool midfielder told Sky Germany.",
      "\"If he doesn't want to be substituted, then he should go and play tennis or play golf. I understand why Kehl is so fed up with him. Every week, every other week, something comes out of his mouth. And he's really not that good.",
      "\"If he were scoring 25 goals or more, then I'd say; 'Do what you want', but he's just not that good.\" Kehl continued: \"Dortmund wants to extend his contract. I don't know if he wants to.",
      "\"Now, they have to find a solution. He has a huge market in England but they won't even look at him in England if he doesn't grow up. It's up to him to show Dortmund - or whichever team he wants to join - that he's mature. Despite these escapades, he plays very good football.\"",
      "United overhauled Ruben Amorim's attack this summer with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Mathsu Cunha, for a combined fee in excess of £200m. A new midfielder is understood to be the priority heading into January, but a possible exit for Joshua Zirkzee means there could be a spot open.",
      "Adeyemi plays on the right and has scored 32 goals in 127 games for Dortmund. The recent controversy around him comes after he was charged and fined €450,000 for possession of two illegal weapons - a knuckleduster and a taser.",
      "Taking to Instragram, Adeyemi apologised for the incident, saying: \"You have probably seen the headlines about me in the last few days. It is not easy for me to talk about this.",
      "\"At the beginning of 2024, out of carelessness and without really thinking about what I was doing, I ordered a so-called 'mystery box' on the internet. It contained items that are not permitted under weapons legislation. Many months later, the package was delivered and ended up unopened at the police station.",
      "\"Nevertheless, it was a huge mistake. One that I am very sorry about, that cost me dearly and that I deeply regret. I know that I am in the public eye and have a role model function. I did not live up to that.",
      "\"That is precisely why it hurts me all the more that I acted so recklessly. I have learned more from this than I can put into words. And I promise you that I will avoid such mistakes in the future. Thank you to everyone who still trusts me and supports me.\"",

United played twice last week, throwing away a late lead at home to Bournemouth before a spirited display at Aston Villa came to nought as they left Villa Park empty-handed.",

      "The club's academy has been under the spotlight of late, with Amorim criticising Chido Obi and Harry Amass for their social media antics. But it was a positive end to the week for the academy as Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey made their senior debuts in the defeat at Villa.",
      "With the January transfer window on the horizon, there's every chance we could see some new faces through the door at Old Trafford, but Amorim has stressed the club will not gamble on short-term fixes at the detriment of their long-term goals.",

      "Gary Neville believes Lisandro Martinez has proved he can be Bruno Fernandes 'emergency replacement' for Manchester United. Fernandes, 31, has been ever present for the Reds since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in 2020.",
      "However, it appears Ruben Amorim will have to cope without him for some time, after the United skipper pulled up with a hamstring injury in the first half of the 2-1 away loss to Aston Villa. Over the course of five years, Fernandes has only missed two matches through injury.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo suffering a calf injury before the clash at Villa Park and Casemiro suspended, Amorim had to get creative by deploying the central defender alongside Manuel Ugarte. After the Argentine impressed in the middle of the park, Neville believes he can be considered as a viable option in midfield.",
      "On the Gary Neville podcast, the former United captain said: \"At half-time, maybe I was thrown by the fact when Bruno Fernandes initially pulled up with his hamstring, he sent Joshua Zirkzee out to warm up. I thought, 'Yeah, that’s right, because he can drop in.'",
      "\"I also liked the idea of having Mason Mount and Zirkzee behind Sesko and Zirkzee and Sesko being potential threats from crosses, you’ve got running into the box, with Mount maybe dropping deeper and playing alongside Ugarte.",
      "\"When I saw Martinez come on, I thought ‘How are United going to get a goal? How are they really going to pose a threat?’ Now they didn’t really pose a threat until that one chance Cunha got, which was a massive chance by the way.",
      "\"I would have liked to have seen Mount and Zirkzee off Sesko with Cunha floating in and around them. He didn’t go for it, but I think Martinez, when he came on in the holding position, Villa did not put any real pressure on him.",
      "\"I thought he was good on the ball, I thought he was tidy. He did a good job in there. Maybe that’s something that will have to happen.",
      "\"Although Casemiro will be back soon as well, so I don’t think we will see him in there too much. But it’s potentially one thing Amorim could do in an emergency if it happens over the Christmas period.”",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo are expected to miss the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle United. The latter pulled up with a calf injury at training before the clash against Villa.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Casemiro will be back from suspension, but the struggling Ugarte is the only fit central midfielder for the clash against Eddie Howe's side. In his post-match interview in the Midlands, Amorim confirmed Fernandes pulled up with a soft tissue injury.",
      "The Portuguese boss said: \"It’s a soft tissue, I think he’s going to lose some games, I don’t know for sure. Let’s see. I don’t know. I don’t want to talk about matters you can’t control.",
      "\"He is a guy who is always fit so he might recover quite well. I think Kobbie might be out [against Newcastle], Bruno is out, so we will see, we are going to find solutions, no excuses, we need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.\"",

      "Manchester United lost 2-1 to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday. Villa took the lead through Morgan Rogers just before half-time, but Matheus Cunha produced a practically immediate response.",
      "The score was level at the break and Bruno Fernandes was brought off after picking up an injury. Lisandro Martinez was selected to replace Fernandes and he stepped into a midfield role.",
      "Rogers restored Villa's lead in the 58th minute to claim the three points for his side.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed:",
      "Cunha hands on his head",
      "Benjamin Sesko was sent through on goal twice in quick succession in the first half and he failed to finish on both occasions. Sesko could have struck the ball quicker - that has been a recurring theme since his arrival from Germany - for the first chance, and he tried to round Emiliano Martinez for the second opportunity.",
      "It was the wrong decision from Sesko. He could have lifted the ball above Martinez if he'd decided to hit it first time, but he tried to take it beyond the goalkeeper and his touch was heavy.",
      "Cunha was responsible for playing Sesko through and he reacted by putting his head in his hands. The Brazilian's reaction said it all - he knew Sesko had wasted a massive chance to go ahead.",
      "Sesko seems to want an extra second on the ball in the box. He got that time in the Bundesliga, but the Premier League is a different beast. He must sharpen up on his decision-making.",
      "Amorim unhappy with Yoro",
      "Amorim dished out constant instructions to Leny Yoro during the Bournemouth game, and footage of one of their interactions went viral on social media. Amorim was speaking about Yoro in his mother tongue, but you did not need to speak Portuguese to work out that he was not happy with the defender.",
      "Yoro was on the receiving end of further instructions against Villa. \"Leny!\" Amorim shouted in the 14th minute, seemingly wanting him to provide width when Ayden Heaven was on the ball in the centre.",
      "Moments before, Yoro had been all over the shop when Ollie Watkins had been played through. The 20-year-old has not been at his best this season, but it's important to note that he looked settled on the left side of the back-three in the spring, and he may be getting to grips with playing on the right.",
      "The warning signs were there, and Yoro was at fault for Villa's opening goal. He gave one of the most in-form players in the league, Rogers, yards of space around the box and was punished for that mistake. Then Yoro was at the scene of the crime again when Rogers scored his second of the game.",
      "The wild Emery celebration",
      "Unai Emery reacted to Rogers' second goal by throwing his coat into the air. Amorim angrily looked at the floor, and a steward picked up the Spaniard's coat before handing it back to him.",
      "Emery's celebration helped to whip up the crowd around the dug-out. Villa Park found its voice again - the home crowd had become frustrated earlier in the game - and roared their side on.",
      "The United section could still be heard, though, chanting \"you've only come to see United\" and \"if Fletcher scores, we're on the pitch\" following the introduction of Jack Fletcher with 20 minutes remaining.",
      "United have won three times on the road in the league this term and the travelling fans deserve better.",
      "Mount tried to set the tempo",
      "Mount has described himself as the \"catalyst\" for the team's press and his energy was important on Sunday, particularly in the opening exchanges when Villa made an aggressive start to the contest.",
      "The hosts fashioned a few opportunities, and Rogers came within inches of scoring. United needed to match the tempo of the opposition, so Mount made a crunching challenge on Ian Maatsen. Mount did brilliantly to get across to Maatsen, and the execution of the tackle was perfect.",
      "The midfielder received a huge cheer from the away section. Mount was subsequently spotted giving instructions to Sesko, and he was seen pleading to the referee over something when United conceded before half time.",
      "United need more players with the same desire as Mount.",
      "Heaton's message for Lacey",
      "Amorim has copped some flak for his handling of academy players, but he introduced Fletcher and handed a senior debut to Shea Lacey with just over six minutes remaining at Villa Park.",
      "Tom Heaton passed on some words of encouragement for Lacey as he got ready to make his debut, tapping him on the chest as if to say \"go out and there and show what you can do\".",
      "Lacey received a warm reception from United fans when he stepped onto the pitch, and he could get more opportunities over the next few weeks due to United missing players at the Africa Cup of Nations.",

      "Gary Lineker reckons Manchester United are showing signs of improvement and they're finally moving in the right direction. Morgan Rogers maintained Aston Villa's title push with a wonderful double that condemned United to a 2-1 defeat at Villa Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "But former Match of the Day host Gary Lineker believes that despite United’s run of form, supporters have reason for optimism and the Reds are finally heading in the right direction under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"I can see improvement in Manchester United this season,\" he said on The Rest is Football podcast. \"I think reasons for optimism.",
      "\"Obviously, there has been a lot of pessimism about Manchester United for a long time, but I genuinely see a team that is progressing. It's slow progress, but I think (they are) definitely moving in the right direction.",
      "\"I thought (Matheus) Cunha is a really good footballer, I mean, he should've scored the header, though. These flicky headers - just head it back where it came from - but he'll know that.",
      "\"Having said that, he did finish his goal really, really well. Yeah, I think they're getting the balance better, especially when you consider they have quite a lot of injuries and at the back.",
      "\"I thought young Ayden Heaven did really well. Mature performance, there was a lot of pressure on that, because you're the middle man out of the three, as well.",
      "\"So I thought he did exceptionally well. And they are a threat going forward, but they couldn't obviously deal with Morgan Rogers.\"",
      "Speaking after the defeat at Villa Park, United head coach Amorim said: \"We were the better team today.",
      "\"We were unlucky, even with the injury of Bruno (Fernandes), but during the game - even without him - we were the better team. We blocked the transitions quite well, and they did really well. We did a very good job no-one is going to remember tomorrow because what matters is the result.",
      "\"We already knew that Aston Villa play with everybody inside, and we needed to overload that situation. We have been training like that.",
      "\"We did different options, we can use different starting elevens depending on the game, so we are improving. Again, I think we deserved so much more today, but the better team didn't win.\"",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Kobbie Mainoo to force his way into the Manchester United team, rather than exploring other opportunities amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo's future at United has been the subject of debate since the summer. The England international asked to leave the club on loan towards the end of the transfer window, but United didn't sanction the move.",
      "The 20-year-old has played just 11 Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this season, all coming off the bench. His only start in this campaign came in the EFL Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, sparked controversy for wearing a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth. Mainoo came on with under 30 minutes left, his third-longest runout in the league this season, in a thriller at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo-Hames posted the image on his Instagram page, and it has led to more questions about the midfielder's future and attitude. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane labelled the stunt idiotic and urged Mainoo to work to get into the squad.",
      "\"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane added on Mainoo's future at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\"",
      "Despite the noise around Mainoo, Amorim has refused to say whether a loan moan would be sanctioned. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

The tournament in Morocco kicks off on Sunday with the host nation taking on Comoros. The final takes place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18.",
      "Many United fans will be wondering when their three stars could return. Morocco are tipped to clinch their first Afcon title since 1976, as per a new AFCON Supercomputer prediction.",
      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "Meanwhile, Mbeumo's Cameroon are predicted to fall at the group stages - meaning he could be available for United again away at Leeds on January 4, should that come to pass.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "The Supercomputer also predicts that Senegal will oust Amad's Ivory Coast in the semi-finals with a resounding 3-0 win. However, he would still not be available for the Manchester derby on January 17 as that date falls on the third-placed playoff - which Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction reckons Amad is also likely to return at a similar time to Mazraoui for the Arsenal game in late January.",
      "In what could be the tournament's biggest upset, Egypt and their star player Mohamed Salah are predicted to fall to Comoros with a 1-0 loss in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both of whom have qualified for next year's World Cup, are expected to reach the quarter-finals, while Tunisia, another World Cup participant, is predicted to miss out on the knockout stages.",
      "Amorim is going to have to find a solution with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui out for the foreseeable future and former United defender Paul Parker believes it will be a very difficult task.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.\"",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Mainoo has found himself out of favour with manager Amorim amidst speculation of a possible departure in January. The England international has been absent from the starting eleven for all of United's 16 league games this season, his only start being in the Red Devils' humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old appeared to have the world at his feet following a standout 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, during which he netted the decisive goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and became an integral part of the England team that reached the Euros final.",
      "However, since Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, things have taken a turn for the worse for the Stockport-born academy product, with United icon Paul Scholes among those advising Mainoo to leave his childhood club in pursuit of more playing time. Reports suggest that Mainoo was eager to move to Napoli over the summer but had his request denied.",
      "Despite his limited game time, the young player received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he came on for Casemiro just after the hour mark during United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. However, post-match attention swiftly shifted to a provocative comment made by his brother at the side of the pitch.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was spotted in the front row sporting a black T-shirt bearing the message \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", a move with the potential to exacerbate an already tense situation. The act has divided United's fanbase, with some accusing Mainoo's relative of unnecessary provocation, while others see it as a legitimate protest.",
      "Mainoo's elder sibling may be a familiar face to many – the fashion model and influencer featured on the 2019 series of popular reality TV show Love Island and has since garnered over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "His name will also resonate within Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo disclosed that his brother's time on Love Island had resulted in him being given an unusual moniker.",
      "He stated: \"My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. He's been doing so since I was like 16.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Cristian Romero is a liability as Spurs captain and Manuel Ugarte is a historically bad problem for Manchester United. But at least Morgan Rogers is good.",
      "We also have thoughts on the winnerification of Leeds, Pep Guardiola and his replacement, and the loserisation of Wolves, Newcastle and many others.",
      "The season’s biggest xG overperformer so far, with the last three players to claim that Premier League crown of particular pertinence to Rogers.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo used it as a platform for a £71m transfer to Manchester United that summer.",
      "Phil Foden was ultimately able to fool England into crowbarring him into the team for Euro 2024 when he reigned that season.",
      "Harry Kane secured a career-defining £100m switch to Bayern Munich after achieving the feat in 2022/23.",
      "Rogers is firing an unlikely Premier League title tilt and Europa League challenge while striking a fine balance between being linked with multi-million-pound moves and forcing his way into the England picture. It’s a neat trick.",
      "",
      "It is difficult to recall many instances of such a drastic turnaround in a struggling team’s fortunes without any specific changes either in manager or squad.",
      "Daniel Farke has introduced Jaka Bijol in a central-defensive three, deployed Brenden Aaronson as a far bigger nuisance through the middle and warmed to the concept of chucking a couple of big lads up front together in Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Noah Okafor.",
      "The starting line-up for their best win of the season, the dismantling of Crystal Palace, could hardly have contrasted more with the side Farke picked to open the campaign, especially in attack.",
      "But that is testament to Farke’s ability and willingness to adapt and adjust to the strengths and weaknesses of his squad under immense pressure.",
      "It took the imminent threat of losing what will surely be his last Premier League job to force that alternate approach, but it has been maintained and delivered the longest unbeaten run of his entire top-flight managerial career, as well as a healthy gap to the bottom three.",
      "The hope will be that this run can continue rather than culminate in such an impressive victory over an obdurate opponent battered into set-piece submission. And it is no blind hope either: Farke and Leeds do appear to have belatedly cracked it at this level.",
      "",
      "There might have been an element of frustration in the Burnley fraternity at Scott Parker keeping his reign on life support by ending a seven-match losing run with a spirited draw which will nevertheless see at least one of Fulham or Nottingham Forest render that point moot in a relegation battle which the Clarets seem increasingly chronically underequipped for.",
      "But Broja won’t have been among them after scoring his first Premier League goal in 810 days.",
      "That was so long ago that Mykhaylo Mudryk scored in the same game, and Mauricio Pochettino sent Raheem Sterling on to replace a typically injured Broja after an hour.",
      "Loan spells with Fulham and Everton have only accentuated Broja’s sense of frustration since. The faith Burnley showed to sign him for £20m on a five-year contract despite those well-documented struggles was finally partially repaid against Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "The seamless move from 007 agent to ‘no goals or assists outside of Germany’ to ‘no goals or assists against 11 men’ is genuinely exceptional work.",
      "Liverpool supporters get to quietly enjoy a player clearly finding his feet, while his denigrators need not stop in their quest to downplay everything he does. There is abundant cake being both had and eaten.",
      "",
      "No longer a defender, with Rico Henry finally back in the Brentford fold to free up Lewis-Potter further forward.",
      "Keith Andrews “inherited Keano as a left-back” and is still “not sure what his best position is”. But a compelling case on the right of a front three was made against admittedly pliable opposition.",
      "Lewis-Potter still had to take his chances against Wolves and did so with either foot to become the first non-Igor Thiago-shaped player this season to score twice in a game for Brentford.",
      "",
      "It is a glorious reflection of both ludicrous manager and ridiculous club that Maresca’s “worst 48 hours” in charge of Chelsea immediately preceded their only win in five Premier League games, and one of just two in seven matches across multiple competitions.",
      "Chelsea’s seasonal crossroads of a cup semi-final, sitting fourth in the Premier League yet closer in terms of points to 12th than 3rd, and likely reaching the Champions League knock-out phase but in the play-offs rather than last 16, feels entirely fitting for a club which often seamlessly flits between glory and disaster.",
      "That general disposition was contained within 90 maddening minutes against Newcastle, whose myriad weaknesses were actively overlooked in the first half before Chelsea finally reacted in the second.",
      "Maresca might feel mysteriously unsupported in the Chelsea boardroom – it remains unclear precisely what his thoughts are in that regard – but the reaction after half-time underlined how he retains the backing of the players, even if Joao Pedro had to pull rank and specifically request the sort of service he belatedly received from Robert Sanchez.",
      "",
      "Seven consecutive wins across three competitions has given Manchester City that usual inevitable, ominous winter air. And Guardiola has still felt comfortable enough to indulge in his actual favourite pastime of basically calling his players a bit rubbish as they briefly returned to the Premier League summit.",
      "Bernardo Silva is his “weakness” who Guardiola was relatively cryptically “not happy with” after thrashing West Ham. But really it could have been anyone who bore the brunt of the Spaniard’s renewed energy.",
      "He does not instinctively sound, look or feel like a man preparing to step down and be replaced by Enzo Maresca. After riding out their considerable struggles around this time last year, Guardiola and Manchester City are approaching their typical winter marathon sprint in good fettle.",
      "",
      "It will be a source of immense pride for Regis Le Bris that Sunderland’s Premier League games have featured the fewest goals of any team – 38, joint with Everton in an obvious show of loyalty to David Moyes.",
      "That attribute is only heightened on the road. Sunderland’s away games have involved just 14 goals, the lowest in the league. So although only Wolves have scored fewer away goals, the Black Cats have picked up a healthy proportion of their points away from the Stadium of Light.",
      "",
      "“Unprofessional” Arsenal, at it again.",
      "",
      "Thomas Frank should probably consider winning more home games, or even just putting together some more consistent, sustainable and enjoyable performances which don’t rely on Richarlison being the world’s greatest agent of chaos.",
      "But when his World Cup-winning captain gets bullied for what was essentially the winner, having lost possession for the first goal, before being sent off for dissent and then an act of unnecessary petulance, one can easily sympathise with his plight.",
      "That Spurs responded so well and almost salvaged something from the wreckage should not mask just how miserably and hilariously Romero let them down in that moment.",
      "But as Jamie Redknapp said, “what Romero did is what Romero does”. There can be no surprise at his ridiculousness. And when one of your supposed leaders cannot be trusted to manage their emotions, then what hope does the manager or rest of the squad have?",
      "",
      "It is genuinely impressive that Ugarte has played 25.5% of Manchester United’s Premier League minutes this season, but been on the pitch for the concession of precisely 50% of their goals against.",
      "His personal goal difference of -9 being the mirror of Manchester United’s best this season, Casemiro on +9, is also a little too on the nose.",
      "The only players with a worse or as bad personal goal difference in 2025/26 all represent clubs in the bottom five. Patrick Dorgu (-6) has the next worst record in the top half.",
      "Ugarte is now on the second-longest run of starts without a victory by a Manchester United player in the Premier League (seven), after Kleberson (10) between January 2004 and May 2005. But at least he isn’t an entitled prick from the academy.",
      "",
      "Write it off as a bad job – an atrocious one really – and move on.",
      "After all, Palace don’t play in the Conference League again until mid-February, and their record in Premier League games immediately after midweek European matches is now: P8 W1 D2 L5 F7 A13.",
      "Each of their Premier League defeats this season have come in those games straight after a Conference League fixture, much like 68% of the goals they have conceded.",
      "Knowing the cause of the problem does not make it any easier to solve until money can be spent again in January, but it does make contextualising those issues much simpler.",
      "How Glasner will help his players manage their Dominic Calvert-Lewin flashbacks and night sweats is another matter entirely.",
      "",
      "In the words of the only man to have endured a worse start to a Premier League reign after being appointed mid-season: it can.",
      "It can get worse for Wolves. Jeff Shi has gone – but also not really, considering the nature of his role as chairman and chief executive of club owners Fosun – and there have been sparks of life against Manchester United and Arsenal.",
      "But it can get worse. Not historically, for no team has ever had fewer points after 17 games of a professional English league season since 1888. No team has ever had a worse record at this stage of a Premier League season. No team has ever looked quite this hopeless and, as Matt Doherty put it, like a group of disconnected “cowards”.",
      "The most senior player at Wolves, their oldest and most seasoned professional, described them as “scared” and “nervous” just to be ahead in a game – something they last experienced on October 5 and have rarely looked like doing since.",
      "Doherty forlornly adding that Wolves “have to somehow find something” summed up the plight of a club ambling through life, desperately hoping for a sudden and random change to rescue them.",
      "Having already changed managers and now executive chairmen, and with their approach to the transfer window landing them in this mess rather than seeming likely to save them in January, the options for salvation seem scarce.",
      "Rob Edwards has lost all six of his games in charge, with only Mick McCarthy’s nine-match streak of defeats after being thrown in at the deep end by Sunderland in March 2003 worse. The circle of parity might simply never close this season.",
      "",
      "While no team has conceded fewer goals in the first half of Premier League games this season, only four have allowed more in the second than Newcastle. The Magpies truly excel at setting a pace they themselves cannot match.",
      "“The thing from our perspective is we want to continue the momentum, continue to dig deep athletically and the intensity of our game has to remain high,” Eddie Howe said at half-time, Nick Woltemade having given his side a two-goal lead at home with significant assistance from Anthony Gordon and Paolo Magdini.",
      "Chelsea had pinned them back, equalised by the 66th minute and neutralised St James’ Park, even if the complaints over some curious non-penalty calls were entirely legitimate and justified.",
      "It remains the case that the earliest goal Newcastle have conceded in the Premier League this season was in the 35th minute. That it has happened twice – against Liverpool in August and West Ham in November – and they ultimately lost both games does not feel like a coincidence.",
      "While Howe generally sets them up phenomenally well, the outcome of Newcastle games becomes a lottery once weary minds forget the preparation and suffer a setback. One of the best teams out of the traps is among the worst when the race is in full flow.",
      "",
      "No player has conceded more Premier League goals than Kilman since he became a £40m defender.",
      "",
      "Has literally never won a game of association football held in December in his nine years as a professional first-team manager.",
      "That sort of woke nonsense is sustainable when such snowflake leftism as a winter break removes that entire month from the calendar, as it did at FC Pipinsried and for the majority of his time with FC St Pauli.",
      "But in the packed, non-stop Premier League it will not wash. Hurzeler has overseen 10 games for the Seagulls in December, returning with six draws and four defeats. Of course their last win in that month came against Spurs.",
      "",
      "If only there was a way Everton could have naturally avoided Tyler Dibling looking barely half-cooked and Jack Grealish seeming entirely knackered heading into a congested part of the schedule in which they have lost crucial players to a mid-season tournament.",
      "Dwight McNeil starting a Premier League game for Everton in big 2025 ahead of Dibling, a £40m summer purchase who has played less than Merlin actual Rohl, is really quite remarkable the more you think about it.",
      "",
      "“Not a stepping stone but a destination.” Sure, Jan.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Bournemouth want to become “not a stepping stone but a destination” for the best talents in the world. It is naive nonsense underlined by Antoine Semenyo.",
      "At this festive time of giving, there are a handful of Premier League players who’ve just received a chance they might not have been expecting.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo did not even play for Manchester United but that does not matter as a new ‘verdict’ drops just as Morgan Rogers is deified.",
      "The bar for atrocious West Ham defending against Manchester City was set remarkably high by Roger Johnson but Max Kilman likes a challenge, so to speak.",

      "It’s Christmas, isn’t it? Just about? And what does Christmas mean? That’s right, recriminations and family in-fighting. But also gifts and presents.",
      "The more traditional footballing application is for defensive and goalkeeping howlers at this jolliest time of the year to be called early Christmas presents. Guglielmo Vicario has certainly embraced his designated role as this year’s Banter Santa.",
      "But there’s another way Christmas gifts can manifest. There are certain players who’ve just received one in the shape of an unexpected chance to re-assert their claims on a more significant role over the weeks ahead after recent events.",
      "",
      "To be clear from the outset, we’re not saying anyone here is wishing injury upon a team-mate. Obviously not. But one man’s setback is always another man’s opportunity, and the injury Alexander Isak suffered in the process of scoring for Liverpool at Tottenham over the weekend has certainly cleared Ekitike’s path for the foreseeable.",
      "At the very least, Isak’s apparently lengthy absence provides clarity for all concerned. The framing of the striker situation at Liverpool now becomes entirely different, with even the decision to spaff so much of their resources (time and financial) on two strikers suddenly looking less mad than it has for most of the season to date.",
      "Ekitike is now the first-choice striker for an extended period of time, and in truth it’s a deserved status based on the relative performances of him and Isak across the season. On every metric outside sunk-cost, Ekitike appears the more deserving recipient of a lengthy shot at really establishing himself as the number one number nine. Isak isn’t even a palindrome, for goodness’ sake.",
      "",
      "Christmas is a time for miracles, and truly we witnessed one at Villa Park on Sunday. No, not Aston Villa’s seventh straight Premier League win, an event now entirely expected by all, but a soft-tissue injury for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "This is quite simply an event that does not occur. So alien was it that neither Bruno nor his manager even seemed to realise he’d pulled his hamstring and did nothing about what was a very obvious situation until half-time as Bruno limped around for 10 minutes in baffled confusion at this unusual sensation in the back of his leg.",
      "Bruno’s reliability is legendary. He has never missed more than two Premier League games in a row for Man United. He has been at the club for 221 Premier League games and played in 212 of them. If he didn’t occasionally get himself suspended, those numbers would be more insane still.",
      "He has played well over 3000 minutes of Premier League football in each of his five full Premier League seasons. The maximum a player can rack up is 3420.",
      "So what is about to happen is simply unprecedented. Manchester United are going to play a significant number of Premier League games at what is even for them in their quiet little season a busy period. We truly don’t know what that looks like.",
      "What it definitely is, though, is a huge opportunity for Mason Mount. He has proved rather nicely over recent weeks that he can play alongside Bruno Fernandes, something that was previously extremely doubtful.",
      "But now he has the chance to prove he can actually step in as United’s string-puller-in-chief in the absence of a man who is quite simply never absent.",
      "The ramifications of how that pans out are pretty significant. For Mount, for United and quite conceivably for England. A quick look at how Thomas Tuchel has operated thus far as England manager suggests he won’t need much encouragement to turn to a player he already knows well.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "The whimsical point to make here is to wonder just how much of a gift getting more chances to perform for Thomas Frank’s Tottenham really is. The prospect of a January escape really might have been more beguiling.",
      "But it does look less likely now with Frank now having to desperately find some way to restore some kind of attacking threat to his team in the upcoming absence of the suspended Xavi Simons.",
      "The Dutchman has been far, far from perfect in his first four months at Spurs. But he has also been far, far from the biggest problem during an increasingly gloomy time that does now look like it really could be a miserable sleepwalk into actual relegation trouble in a season where, unlike last year, such a thing actually exists for real.",
      "Spurs have won only eight games in all competitions since Xavi arrived from Germany late in the window. Xavi has started every one of those eight games.",
      "If that record of being unable to win without him remains in place after the next three games, it is surely inconceivable that Frank remains in place. And the relegation threat will be very, very real indeed.",
      "Johnson has been one of the biggest losers from Ange Postecoglou’s departure. He has a particular set of skills that, more than just about anyone else in the Spurs squad, were ideally suited to Angeball.",
      "His ability to arrive late into space on one side of the penalty area as a cross arrived from the other was often underappreciated. There’s a bit of Sterling Lite about it; it doesn’t necessarily look that impressive even when it’s very effective.",
      "But if it was as easy as it looks, then more players would do it wouldn’t they? Unfortunately, creating chances isn’t really something Frank’s Spurs do. Even more so when Xavi is absent. So Johnson might be getting the most dubious of gifts; a chance to impress under conditions that set him up to fail.",
      "That, though, brings us back to the very start. At least it might hasten his departure from this godforsaken club, and that might be the best gift of all, in a way.",
      "",
      "We kind of think it might actually end up being Kai Havertz who gets the greatest gift, assuming that the Arsenal medical team’s prognosis of a return late this year or early next is accurate. And for goodness’ sake, when has the Arsenal medical team’s prognosis ever been off?",
      "But he’s not back yet, and we must accept the small chance he won’t be for a while. And there is also simply no way we’re grown-up enough to pass up the opportunity to bring a player literally called Gabriel Jesus into a feature we’ve given a lazy Christmas-based hook.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres may have scored the winning goal from the penalty spot at Everton, but he remains Floppy McFlopface. His goal returns aren’t disastrous, but nor are they anywhere near sufficient to make up for the sheer paucity of his wider contribution. These are not Erling Haaland numbers. They’re not even Richarlison numbers.",
      "Jesus is certain to start against a suddenly porous Palace in the Carabao this week and has a clear opportunity to stake a claim to start against Brighton after Christmas. It is not at all outlandish to suggest Gyokeres could be Arsenal’s third-choice striker by February.",
      "",
      "Has struggled to make a significant impression this season since his loan move from Flamengo became a permanent one. But there are just a couple of encouraging signs.",
      "He came on at half-time after a disastrous opening 45 minutes against Newcastle and things at least got a bit less sh*t from there.",
      "And after replacing the injured Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in the early stages of defeat against Chelsea, he retained his starting spot against Arsenal. Could now get the chance to turn a season of frequent but generally brief cameos into something more substantial in the games ahead, most of which will be against teams who are not Chelsea and Arsenal.",
      "Cristian Romero is a liability as Spurs captain and Manuel Ugarte is a historically bad problem for Manchester United. But at least Morgan Rogers is good.",

      "The Red Devils signed Zirkzee from Bologna for £36.5m in July 2024 as Erik ten Hag looked for attacking reinforcements.",
      "However, Ten Hag left just months later and was replaced by Ruben Amorim with the Netherlands international struggling for game time in recent months.",
      "Zirkzee was in and out the starting XI last season under Amorim but their summer reinforcements in attack have seen the Dutchman drop further down the pecking order at Man Utd.",
      "If Man Utd can get another attacker in the building over the January transfer window, it seems likely that Zirkzee will be allowed to leave Old Trafford.",
      "Giving an update, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Man Utd are unlikely to green light a deal at the start of the window with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo away on Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Aston Villa 2-1 Man United: Rogers, Amorim, title deeds and rocking-horse sh*t",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “I can reveal that a meeting took place last week between Roma and the agents of Joshua Zirkzee, with further progress made in conversations this week.",
      "“Roma consider the player a top priority, and manager Gian Piero Gasperini is pushing to bring him in as early as January.",
      "“Manchester United, however, are reluctant to give the green light at the start of the window. With several absences already – including Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo heading to AFCON, Bruno Fernandes injured, and Kobbie Mainoo unavailable – United are short of options.",
      "“From the player’s side, Roma are making progress. Zirkzee is open to the move, attracted by the promise of regular football, a central role, and the chance to shine again in Serie A, where he previously impressed with Bologna.”",
      "And now Italian publication Il Messaggero has claimed that Roma have made an ‘offer’ of €5m for the loan deal in January, plus another €30m in June to make the deal permanent, while a potential €5m Champions League qualification bonus would take the deal to €40m in total.",
      "The report adds that it ‘represents an acceptable compromise (considering the €42 million paid to Bologna, plus almost €18 million in additional costs) for a player who also sat on the sidelines against Aston Villa yesterday.’",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker recently claimed that Zirkzee was “nowhere near the level” of summer signing Benjamin Sesko, who has disappointed so far this season.",
      "Parker told AceOdds.com: “He is nowhere near the level of Sesko, who is very unselfish and makes all the right runs, and we also see now how big of a gap there is between the two of them. Zirkzee is just miles away from what is expected when you play at Man United.",
      "“It’s quite ironic actually, that Zirkzee is now playing more because Sesko is injured, but I think Zirkzee would rather want Sesko to be ready and play ahead of him, so he can get his loan move away in January. He might miss out on it now because of Sesko’s injury.",
      "“I don’t like what I am seeing from Zirkzee at all. Everything about him is trying to be flashy and it just doesn’t work. He has to be frustrated, because nothing works out for him. He looks like he is frustrated, and I totally get it, but at the end of the day it is his own fault.",
      "“I am wondering at times what they actually saw in Zirkzee. Fair enough, he is alright on the ball and his touch is decent, but he is just not going to make a difference for Man United ever.”",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made as many saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet following at Brighton",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a clean sheet against Sunderland earned with one especially fine save from Omar Alderete’s header.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things might be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 10 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham before returning to help beat Man Utd.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help him displace this fella…",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals.",
      "",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appear to know nothing of.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet at Wolves was very, very welcome. The battering by Everton and a groin twang less so.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up and returned once more at West Ham. Conceding five goals from 2.8 PSxG was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a penalty save at Wolves – even if he conceded it – sees the Irishman climb towards respectability.",
      "",
      "Making just five saves in five Premier League appearances hardly screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider. And beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – but when Arsenal have needed him, has he done enough? Reports suggest the Gunners might be looking to upgrade.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Since then, performing roughly as expected, even if many remain unconvinced.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he? It has been a rotten few weeks for the Cherries keeper, who falls to the bottom of this ranking after conceding four at Old Trafford. United’s 3.3 PSxG was not as damning on Petrovic as Casemiro’s header that seemed to terrify the Serbian.",
      "Cristian Romero is a liability as Spurs captain and Manuel Ugarte is a historically bad problem for Manchester United. But at least Morgan Rogers is good.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Bournemouth want to become “not a stepping stone but a destination” for the best talents in the world. It is naive nonsense underlined by Antoine Semenyo.",
      "At this festive time of giving, there are a handful of Premier League players who’ve just received a chance they might not have been expecting.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo did not even play for Manchester United but that does not matter as a new ‘verdict’ drops just as Morgan Rogers is deified.",
      "The bar for atrocious West Ham defending against Manchester City was set remarkably high by Roger Johnson but Max Kilman likes a challenge, so to speak."

      "At best, Casemiro was expected to be a bit-part player for Man Utd this season as he was coming off a poor 2024/25 campaign and was heavily linked with a transfer in the summer. But he has clearly put the work in to prove Jamie Carragher and others wrong, becoming indispensable for the Premier League giants again.",
      "This means that the Brazilian international will be lauded upon leaving Man Utd rather than being ushered out of the back door like an embarrassing uncle this summer. There is also a very real prospect of Casemiro signing a contract extension beyond 2026, provided he accepts a pay cut rather than extending his current deal on the same terms.",
      "If this were plausible, Man Utd should definitely keep Casemiro for another year, but the 33-year-old is still doomed to at least slip in the pecking order at Old Trafford next year because everyone knows that his long-term replacement, likely Carlos Baleba, is going to be their next marquee signing and become one of Ruben Amorim’s main men.",

      "Chelsea are certainly on track to win the title in the next couple of years, but they are not there yet; upgrades are needed in key positions to bridge the gap to Arsenal and Manchester City.",

The 27-year-old, who has seven goals in 20 appearances this season, was preferred to Manchester United newbie Benjamin Sesko in the summer, but neither player has lived up to expectations in recent months.",
      "Gyokeres netted the winning goal vs Everton via a penalty on Saturday, but he was still “not good enough” as he and the club struggle to bring the best out of one another in this unnatural relationship.",
      "The striker’s actual goal tally is respectable, but most of his goals have come when Arsenal have been dominant against lowly opposition and he has failed to get in the game against stronger foes.",
      "Gyokeres was signed to provide the final piece of the jigsaw in Arsenal’s attack, but they are no more effective with him up front than they were last season, with Kai Havertz complementing Mikel Arteta’s side more.",

      "Konate has had a few good performances this season, but it has more often been the case that he has been a calamitous component in a failing Liverpool defence and has made glaring mistakes far too often.",
      "This has severely weakened his negotiating position ahead of his contract expiry in 2026, with a once-expected move to Real Madrid now off the table.",

      "On paper, Shaw is one of the few natural fits for Amorim’s system as he can operate as a left wing-back and left centre-back, but his actual performances have suggested otherwise, as it looks like the Englishman’s best days are behind him.",

      "But we do once again find ourselves with a pretty clear favourite to become the fifth manager out on his ear this season, with Thomas Frank in big, big trouble after Tottenham’s abysmal showing in a 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest and subsequent 2-1 loss with nine (yes, NINE) men against Liverpool.",
      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, while Scott Parker and Daniel Farke also remain in trouble and ongoing doubts around West Ham’s ability to drag themselves out of the bottom three have to raise the possibility of both the Hammers and Nuno Espirito Santo looking for a second new appointment of the season.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Victory over Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now 11 wins in 12 Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though, but spangling Tottenham will have gone down enormously well with his boss for sure.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves, but derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of three consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the potential novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",

      "Aston Villa ended a year in which they’ve turned Villa Park into a fortress with victory over the one team that has never had reason to fear a trip here.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ double in a hard-fought 2-1 victory keeps Villa – who were not at their best – on the tails of Arsenal and Man City at the top of the table and perhaps (but only perhaps) more significantly extends their lead over any other Champions League chaser to a chasm-like seven points.",
      "Unai Emery and his side really are on the road to something special, while there was encouragement, frustration and a brand new quandary for Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1) For all but the youngest Man United fans, there will have been something uncannily familiar about this game. An away team coming to a team on a formidable winning run and throwing absolutely everything at them, arguably having the better of the game on the balance of the 90 minutes, and then going home with absolutely nothing.",
      "Old Trafford saw more games like this than any of care to remember in the 1990s and 2000s. That Villa Park is now the venue for such behaviour really is quite something. For the first time since before that era of United dominance – before the invention of football in 1992 even – Villa have won seven top-flight matches in a row. Things are happening here.",
      "",
      "2) It shouldn’t really need reaffirming about a team that’s just won seven in a row – and 11 in 12 – but Aston Villa absolutely are in a title race now right up until they aren’t. What’s happened since the late winner against Arsenal goes against all narrative tradition for the unexpected team that suddenly inserts itself into a title situation with a thunderously significant and dramatic victory over a team that in that one moment suddenly becomes a direct rival.",
      "Falling behind at West Ham last weekend could have ended the title charge as soon as it began. The visit of a Man United team that had lost to Villa here once in 30 years could have ended the title charge. But on Villa go.",
      "If we can still talk about them as we are now in nine days’ time after trips to Stamford Bridge and the Emirates…",
      "",
      "3) What’s absolutely true for now, though, is that Villa have placed themselves into a leading pack with Arsenal and City – on merit – and thoroughly distanced themselves from the chasing pack. The gap to fourth place is now seven points. It’s an astonishing position they find themselves in, especially after the way the season started with the now-infamous five-match streak without a win – four matches without even so much as a goal.",
      "Wins for Arsenal and City on Saturday denied Villa the chance to hurt them, but Chelsea’s dropped points at Newcastle offered the chance to put real distance between them and the chasing pack. Taking that chance in the manner they did must be enormously pleasing for Unai Emery and his team.",
      "",
      "4) Hardly revelatory to highlight Morgan Rogers as the star attraction here. Two stunning goals added to a collection of stunning goals this season, Leny Yoro given an absolute torrid, and a first-half trick duly repeated in the second.",
      "He is the main reason Villa’s title challenge might have some legs. Villa are a very good side expertly trained and prepared by a brilliant manager; that puts them in position to do something special. But the kind of special they’re now in position to dream of requires individual players of individual brilliance within that rock-solid framework.",
      "Villa would still be a good team without Rogers, but they wouldn’t be viable title contenders or anything like it. With the possible exception of Emi Martinez, we’re not sure that’s true of any other single player. Rogers is the difference maker for Villa, a man who produces moments like these to turn what was by their own now lofty standards a sub-par overall performance into three more points against an avowed bogey team.",
      "",
      "5) Rogers also produces these moments when they really count, too. These were his first Villa Park goals of this Premier League season, but this is more praise than criticism. All his other goals in the league this season have come in victories from behind away from home. Vital goals at vital times in the toughest situations.",
      "That applies just as much here, with both his goals sublime on their own aesthetic and technical level but also coming at vital times where Villa appeared to be second best.",
      "",
      "6) That fact will be only part of what frustrates Ruben Amorim about what was genuinely one of his more impressive games as Man United manager; for all Rogers’ brilliance with both goals they were also avoidable from a United point of view.",
      "Yoro had a desperately poor game in a generally sound United effort achieved despite great adversity. Yoro’s futile struggle to get to grips with Rogers was a key contributor to both goals, but especially the first.",
      "",
      "7) There’s no real shame in being beaten by the threat and talent Rogers possesses; but there is in apparently being unaware of its existence.",
      "With time ticking down in a first half United had rather impressively controlled, John McGinn fizzed a thigh-high pass out from midfield to Rogers on the left. His first touch was good enough to keep the ball alive but no more.",
      "Yet as Rogers buzzed over towards the touchline to retrieve it, Yoro merely ambled in that general direction. By the time Rogers had danced inside onto his right foot and curled a shot inside Senne Lammens’ far post, Yoro still hadn’t twigged what was happening. Still hadn’t got close enough to even pressure the shot, never mind actually prevent or block it.",
      "It takes nothing away from the brilliance of everything Rogers did to note he was given a bizarre helping hand by some astonishingly passive defending against Villa’s most conspicuous threat.",
      "",
      "8) And then it all happened again, in much the same way and in with the general flow of the match at that point feeling much the same. Absolutely maddening for Amorim.",
      "",
      "9) If only for the obvious reason that the United boss had got so much right. A great deal of it was firmly in ‘needs must’ territory but that is often the fire where the greatest solutions are forged.",
      "With Casemiro suspended and Kobbie Mainoo unavailable through injury, Manuel Ugarte was handed a start in United’s midfield almost by default.",
      "His jarring lack of quality on the ball remains a massive issue, and there was one conspicuous moment in the first half where Youri Tielemans picked his pocket all too easily, but he did at least perform a semi-functional destroyer’s role as the deepest point of a midfield triangle that, in the first half at least, featured Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes as its more advanced corners.",
      "",
      "10) This is not the first time in recent weeks that Amorim has moved away slightly from his trademark rigid and unshakeable adherence to 3-4-3 and it is most welcome. The acknowledgement that more bodies were needed in the middle of the park against an opponent of Villa’s quality is a sign of self-awareness. That’s a strength, not a weakness.",
      "And it worked, it really did. It might be a stretch to say United dominated the first half, but they certainly controlled it, and went in deservedly level after Matheus Cunha profited from Patrick Dorgu’s good work in for once pressuring Villa into a mistake as they looked to play through the United press.",
      "Matty Cash is so often such a reliable conduit for Emi Martinez to start such proceedings, but was badly caught out this time.",
      "",
      "11) Yet by the time of those goals at the end of the first half, another potentially seismic moment for United’s whole season had already occurred. Bruno Fernandes picked up a muscle injury. It cannot be overstated what a big deal that is, both in its potential impact on United’s season and sheer rocking-horse-shit rareness.",
      "Fernandes is that rare player seemingly capable of just playing all the football all the time with almost no ill-effects. Indeed, he seemed so perplexed by the entire concept of doing a hammy that he was unwilling to accept it had happened. Or perhaps unaware of what that painful sensation in his leg even was.",
      "He limped and laboured on until half-time despite it being obvious to every single other person among the 40,000 inside Villa Park what had just happened.",
      "",
      "12) His half-time withdrawal marked just the third time he had failed to reach 90 minutes in a Premier League game this season. In the previous two he came off after 85 and 87 minutes.",
      "He has cleared the 3000-minute mark in the Premier League alone in each of his five full seasons at United. He has never missed more than two Premier League games in a season through injury.",
      "In all he has featured in 212 out of 221 Manchester United league games since joining in the January transfer window of 2020. It’s a remarkable effort.",
      "And if today’s injury is anything like what it looked like – and Amorim did not sound at all cheery about it post-match – then he and United could be entering whole new territory.",
      "",
      "13) Every crisis presents an opportunity, though. This freakishly unusual Fernandes setback was spectacularly ill-timed for United and Amorim. As the United boss scoured a substitutes’ bench denuded by AFCON, injuries and suspensions, he will have seen precious little option.",
      "One was Joshua Zirkzee, the only outfielder among the United replacements to have started a game in the Premier League this season. That was the obvious option, but an imperfect one for the task at hand given United were level at what is currently the toughest ground to visit in the country and had secured their foothold in the game on the back of winning that midfield battle.",
      "",
      "14) Amorim went for Plan B and Lisandro Martinez, himself on the road back from serious injury but with midfield experience from his Ajax days. He did a fine job. The orientation of the triangle altered slightly; there were now two deeper-lying points in Ugarte and Martinez with Mount more advanced.",
      "If one wanted to be mischievous, one might suggest Martinez’s 45 minutes in the role offered a more compelling case than Ugarte’s 73 before he duly made way for Zirkzee as United chased another equaliser.",
      "At the very least, Martinez has put himself into the conversation should Fernandes’ absence be a lengthy one. He might even have got himself a goal and you’d certainly be surprised now to see Amorim revert back to his previous midfield shape for future games in and around this tariff of difficulty.",
      "",
      "15) The other obvious opportunity comes for Mason Mount. His whole Man United career has been defined by Bruno Fernandes’ sheer reliability in terms of both appearances and output. Even in recent weeks when he has proved rather nicely that he absolutely can play alongside United’s star man it has been in a support-act kind of way.",
      "But with Mount playing the best football of his United career in that time and now seeing the field quite literally cleared for him, we do wonder. He’s something of a forgotten man but 2026 could yet prove a big one for him with both club and country; we know Thomas Tuchel doesn’t need much excuse to call up players he knows he can trust, and few Englishmen are more firmly inside that particular circle than Mount.",
      "",
      "16) The final word has to go to Villa, though, who have completed an extraordinary year with an extraordinary set of home numbers. In all competitions they played 27 games at Villa Park in 2025. They won 22, drew four and lost only one.",
      "Among the teams beaten here this year have been both their current title rivals, six of the other seven members in all of what we’ll reluctantly and frankly inaccurately label the Big Eight, as well as the literal best team in Europe.",
      "And it really does set up the possibility of 2026 being even more memorable."

      "“I thought, ‘Uh oh, you could be in trouble here’, because Rogers can do that.",
      "“There’s no doubt Leny Yoro has to get out quicker, he has to make sure confronts him outside the box.",
      "“But once doesn’t, Rogers still has a lot to do and my goodness me does he do it!",
      "“They’ve been really average in this first half, Aston Villa, but Morgan Rogers is having a very special season and that is a really, really wonderful goal.”",
      "Neville added: “I’ve played that position and when you play against a special player you have to edge over, if the touch is off you need to get out close and harass him, you can’t drift.",
      "“He just ambled, Yoro, which was a big mistake.”",

      "As Ruben Amorim looked on the brink of the sack after Manchester United’s loss against Brentford in September, a key factor behind his exit would have been his blank refusal to adapt to get the best out of his squad.",
      "This same issue contributed to Man Utd‘s damaging 1-0 home loss to 10-man Everton, with his side’s attack held back by the rigid focus on the head coach’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "However, in recent weeks, Amorim has finally relented, with the tweaks to his formation and playing style bearing fruit for the Red Devils.",
      "The absences of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui due to the African Cup of Nations, on top of Man Utd’s issues with injuries and suspensions, have somewhat forced Amorim’s hand, but it has seen him proactively find solutions to nullify opponents and maximise the output from the players at his disposal.",
      "There was more evidence of this against in-form Aston Villa, who went into Sunday’s game on a run of nine straight wins in all competitions, as Amorim opted to match Unai Emery’s side with more bodies than usual in the middle of the pitch.",
      "Man Utd supporters would have let out an audible gulp upon seeing Manuel Ugarte in the starting XI against Villa, with the club losing all of the last six Premier League games when the £42m flop has started.",
      "Before the game, we speculated that this could be Ugarte’s final chance to prevent a January transfer, and the declining midfielder, who is desperately poor in possession, failed to take his latest opportunity.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd still won the midfield battle in the first half and dominated against a flat Villa, with Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha overpowering their opponents.",
      "READ: Who will sign Semenyo in January and what will the four rejected sides, including Man Utd, do instead?",
      "The two sides exchanged decent chances in the opening ten minutes before Man Utd took control of the game, but it was Aston Villa who took the lead.",
      "It was a goal that really came from nowhere, with man of the moment Morgan Rogers producing his latest of many stunning solo goals.",
      "Rogers left onlookers gushing just from keeping the ball in play with a couple of sublime touches following John McGinn’s well-hit crossfield pass, but he did not stop there. With the help of Leny Yoro, who Gary Neville said was “ambling” in a “big mistake” as he carelessly opted against keeping the Englishman on his weaker left foot, he drifted inside and curled home a sensational effort into the far top corner.",
      "It would have been harsh on Man Utd if they trailed at the break, and they didn’t as Matty Cash was punished for being sloppy, with Patrick Dorgy alert to challenge the right-back and set up Matheus Cunha, who clinically converted past Emiliano Martinez from inside the penalty area.",
      "Amorim cannot be faulted for his role as his changes saw Man Utd get the better of Aston Villa for large portions of the day, though he and his side are hamstrung by key players being unavailable.",
      "Their bench against Aston Villa included two goalkeepers and five youngsters, with their situation worsened by captain Bruno Fernandes appearing to pull his hamstring.",
      "Amorim stuck to his working system as Lisandro Martinez replaced Fernandes in midfield at half time, with Man Utd’s weak bench further evidenced by Joshua Zirkzee and teenager Jack Fletcher being their next two substitutions.",
      "Despite this, the game’s flow after the interval was similar to the first half as Man Utd had the better of the action, though Aston Villa’s great equaliser proved the difference.",
      "Villa are the form team in the Premier League, but they struggled to hit their usual heights against bogey team Man Utd and had to rely on the brilliance of Rogers to get them over the line.",
      "His second goal was never going to be as good as his first, but it was a strong follow-up; he latched onto a loose ball in the penalty area following good play from Ollie Watkins and Youri Tielemans and curled home into the corner of the net via another poor challenge from Yoro.",
      "Man Utd’s push for an equaliser came to no avail as Aston Villa defended strongly, with Rogers’ special brace securing their tenth win in a row that leaves them only three points adrift of the top of the table at Christmas.",
      "In the aftermath of this match, reckless media outlets will try to tell you that this loss has added fresh fuel to the ‘Amorim sack’ conversation, but on this occasion, this would be particularly unjustified.",
      "Actually, Amorim’s decisions contributed to Man Utd besting Aston Villa in every department aside from the scoreline, which warrants praise, not ridicule, given the immense form of the hosts and the sheer lack of options at the head coach’s disposal.",

      "The Red Devils looking to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window, which could knock Mainoo even further down the pecking order.",
      "Amorim, much to the annoyance of the Man Utd board, publicly declared that Mainoo would be serving as a back-up option to captain Bruno Fernandes this season.",
      "That saw Mainoo seek a loan move away from Old Trafford before the end of the summer transfer window before being talked into staying by Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox.",

      "“It’s not that Kobbie is going to play because of that, or he’s not going to play because of that, so no consequences. What I can tell you is that Mainoo, in his mind, still has this desire to play more, still has this intention to go on loan, still has this plan to go play, develop, grow and then return to Man Utd.",
      "“It’s an opportunity for Man Utd to have a better player in the near future. It’s an opportunity for the player to have a chance to go to the World Cup 2026 with England. So far, he has started zero games in the Premier League, and Kobbie doesn’t want to be in this situation also for the second half of the season.",

It’s more than 10 clubs, but Napoli, after [Scott] McTominay, after Rasmus Hojlund – they are both doing very good there – hope that they can have the opportunity to get also Mainoo from Man Utd.",

      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",

Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",

      "When you're young, all you want to do is get old. You get to 18 and all you want to do is drive and then you want to do this and that.",
      "I've said it before but you have such a different outlook on life when things like this have happened because there's nothing that can prepare you for it.",
      "But you become more grateful and you become more humble, and stuff that you might have looked down your nose at and thought that's just part of everyday life, it kind of rises up to your eye level and you think you've got to be grateful for what you have.",
      "It has given me a different perspective, but it's making a situation that is really tough and taking as many positives out of it as I can.",
      "Otherwise you can't live the rest of your life being negative and so upset about it.",

      "Even if someone's having the best time of their life and everything's going well and they might have a business and it's doing really well, whatever it might be, it's still checking in on them because you don't want it to just become a point where it's like, only when things are going wrong, 'are you okay?'",

      "I know it will 100 per cent feel like such a big thing and it'd be so difficult to talk and you feel like it's also that feeling of being past help but you're never ever past help like if you reach out… there isn't an age limit on when you can speak up or go to therapy or, you know, make a situation better.",

      "My dad wouldn't have known how much he was loved and cared for. I had messages from people... he was working at a tyre place changing tyres, people who've met him once saying 'oh, such a lovely man,' so on and so forth.

      "The club have been amazing since I've come back in.",
      "It's one of them, I was back in a week after because I think this is my passion and it's a positive distraction, it's what I enjoy doing but if I needed to take a month, two months, whatever it might be, there wouldn't have been a problem.",
      "I've been here for so long, it's like my family and at times you see people at football more than you see your family at home and you're so close to them.",
      "It was whatever you need to do, however it's going to look for you, it can look like that and I'm so appreciative for that because like I said there was no pressure on getting back in or having to meet this date or this time, it was whatever you feel like and even if you come back in and you're not feeling great, dip back out if you need to.",
      "I haven't because I love my job, it's a job at the end of the day but it's what you've worked so hard for being a young kid that you can make this your work and I love playing football. And obviously at the minute, you know, I'm injured and that and it is difficult but then it's looking at other ways you can spend your time and positive distractions.",
      "To be honest I've picked up the DJing, so I'm just giving that a go now but yeah because I can't play padel and stuff (because of his injury).",
      "You look at things with a bit of a different perspective on life…football isn't my whole identity as much as you love it so much, it's kind of broadening those horizons and trying to trying to fulfil your life in other ways where I'm not just reliant on if I'm fit and not injured because then, when I do get injured, mentally you can take a bit of a dip because you're so caught up on needing to get back. And so, just broadening those horizons is what I've been trying to do, to be honest.",
      "Hopefully I'll get back from the injury I've got and get out on loan in January.",
      "But I think the thing for me it's about going forward… there's always going to be a piece of you missing. Anybody who's gone through this will know there'll always be a piece of you missing but you learn to just carry on because you have to.",
      "What I'm saying is just because six months have passed, we're still going to talk about our feelings and not act like that's done and that's behind us. There's never any time limit on it.",

      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less than convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliot's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's future will dominate at least the first part of Bournemouth's window and is something that could be concluded quickly. His £65m release clause is straightforward but not active for the entire window, in part to protect Bournemouth from being left short of a replacement on February 1.",
      "They want to bring in a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone given Semenyo almost left in the summer. Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, goalkeeper is a position Bournemouth are looking to recruit in again to find someone that can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez Liverpool. There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Spurs and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Chelsea in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Captain Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer - but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Man City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right wing-back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds United are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlwo, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window even after spending £200m+ net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah firmly put his future on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad - but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City are one of those clubs that are firmly in the race for Antoine Semenyo in January, with some insiders believing they are the strongest contenders for his signature.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were wiling to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open for Stefan Ortega to leave.",
      "Longer-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting on, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are the other club firmly in the running to sign Antoine Semenyo - a player of long-term interest to the club. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires the club to be careful but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "At the time of writing, Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are out injured and if they lose anyone else then Newcastle will be in big bother. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is one of long-term interest and the one they have been trying hard for lately - but they look increasingly likely to miss out to the competition. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "If they do not get Semenyo it does not mean Spurs will necessarily try to sign another out-and-out left-winger. It could instead be a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026."

      "Gary Neville on Ruben Amorim's change in Man Utd approach: \"I'm happy he's adapting... he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton. That would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job\"",
      "Monday 22 December 2025 06:11, UK",
      "Gary Neville feels Ruben Amorim has given himself a blueprint to move forward after a notable change in style this week - but Roy Keane remains unimpressed with \"one of the worst teams in the league\" without the ball.",
      "For the first time in his tenure, Amorim has visibly moved away from the rigid 3-4-2-1 formation he had previously stuck with both at Old Trafford and across his managerial career, displaying a level of flexibility which had previously become a bone of contention for Manchester United supporters.",
      "After deploying a hybrid back four in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth, United put on another improved display despite losing 2-1 to in-form Aston Villa at Villa Park and deserved more than they got for the second game in succession.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: \"I thought it was a really good performance, but the details of the two goals have cost them.",
      "\"Now that's going to continue to happen whilst they don't have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don't have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "\"What I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things. One, the manager has changed. Quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change, the five or the three [at the back], the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front, that has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That's a good thing.",
      "\"I'm happy that the manager is adapting to what's happening out there because of what's happening with AFCON, but also I think there's an element where he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton at home.",
      "\"More of that would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job, and will allow him to build something, because you can build off what you've seen here.",
      "\"Manchester United can still finish in the top five and they've missed three or four opportunities in the last three weeks to do that, but if they can get those players back from AFCON and they can stay fit, they can do something.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has got to approach it the way in which he has in the last five or six days. The system has been tweaked - more than tweaked - and I think with [Mason] Mount, [Matheus] Cunha, [Bruno] Fernandes, [Bejamin] Sesko, [Bryan] Mbeumo and Amad [Diallo] out there on the pitch, not all of them but probably four or five of them, they will cause a lot of teams a lot of problems.\"",
      "Keane was similarly impressed with Man Utd's attacking output, with Amorim's side only outscored by Manchester City this season, but felt that was little excuse for the ease with which they were cut apart for both of Morgan Rogers' fine strikes in their latest defeat - their fifth from 17 league games.",
      "Leny Yoro was singled out for criticism for a lack of intensity in closing down Rogers when he first received the ball before cutting inside and netting a stunning opener, while Keane was just as frustrated by Diogo Dalot's attempts to block a cross leading up to his second.",
      "\"You can have all the talent in the world, but you have to roll your sleeves up and when the game gets a bit tight you say you're going to do your bit for the team,\" he said on Super Sunday. \"This isn't a tricky winger, it's just a little shimmy. He's like yeah, have a cross. This ends up being the winning goal.",
      "\"It's not like someone's done a brilliant trick or run at him with real pace. You get down low, you get your body in position. You say if you're going to get a cross in, you're going to have to do remarkably well.",

      "Goals were likely, United having scored four in each of their two previous games but struggled defensively. And yet, the goalkeepers starred until late in the first half, Senne Lammens keeping out John McGinn, Emi Martinez saving well from Benjamin Sesko.",
      "A bit of Rogers magic brought the breakthrough, cutting inside and finding the top corner. But Villa's celebrations were brief because Matty Cash was dispossessed by Patrick Dorgu, allowing Cunha to run through unchallenged to level before the interval.",

      "United were worth their equaliser, having played the more enterprising football in the opening 45 minutes. But it became trickier in the second half, Bruno Fernandes going off injured and Lisandro Martinez coming on in midfield with Kobbie Mainoo absent.",
      "Rogers' second, another curled effort beyond Lammens, restored Villa's lead and this time Cunha could not find the response. The Brazilian forward should have done so. His unmarked header from Dorgu's left-wing cross missed the target from six yards out.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows called EVERY match result correct on Saturday, going eight from eight with the accumulator paying 1,200/1 - can he stay perfect?",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in the U21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",

No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",

      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",

      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",

      "Obi - having watched him multiple times for the U21s, still has plenty of improvement to go with coaches in the academy demanding more in his work off the ball and build-up play.",
      "But both - as well as other players last season - received opportunities because of the multiple injuries to the squad while also prioritising the Europa League. This is what Amorim tried to explain last week and he expanded on today.",
      "There will be a high chance for those in the academy like Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher to potentially impress in the next month and I expect a few on the bench on Sunday with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire injured, Casemiro suspended and Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui away for AFCON.",

      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
