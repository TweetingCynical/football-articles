      "Manchester United flop Andre Onana has hit his lowest ebb yet, having been left out of Cameroon's squad for the African Cup of Nations. The goalkeeper joined Turkish side Trabzonspor in the summer after falling out favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "And while he has been in better form recently, that has not been enough to see Onana earn a reprieve when it comes to Cameroon. Onana has been left out of his nation's squad for the upcoming AFCON tournament.",
      "The 29-year-old has collected 53 caps for his country so far and played every minute during the African side's World Cup qualifying campaign that ultimately ended in failure. AFCON gets underway on December 21, with Cameroon set to take on Gabon, Ivory Coast and Mozambique in the group stage.",
      "Onana's axe comes on a dramatic day for Cameroon, with manager Marc Brys having been sacked just days before the tournament gets underway.",
      "Onana has made 11 appearances for Trabzonspor so far this season in all competitions. His performances have however reportedly been good enough for club chiefs to make a move for him on a permanent basis.",
      "Speaking earlier this season, Amorim said on his goalkeeper's loan departure: “We saw Andre had a very, very good season at Inter. The quality is there. But we are in the club and sometimes, in the moment, things can get harder and harder.",
      "“You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail. I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it’s hard to point why. It’s the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",
      "Onana started his career with Dutch side Ajax before moving to Italian giants Inter Milan. He went on to become one of Europe's standout goalkeepers during his time in Serie A.",
      "His form was good enough to convince the Red Devils to pay £43m for his services in 2023. He spent two seasons as United's number one, albeit high-profile mistakes blighted his game at Old Trafford.",
      "He was eventually allowed to leave the club this summer and was replaced by Senne Lammens, who joined United from Royal Antwerp. The Belgian has enjoyed a bright start to life at Old Trafford despite just one clean sheet in his opening seven games.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed - albeit in jest - that a beloved children's television personality influenced his choice to undergo a medical procedure. The football legend disclosed on his BBC podcast that CBeebies' favourite Mr Tumble played a role in his vasectomy decision.",
      "On the most recent instalment of 'The Wayne Rooney Show', the 40-year-old Manchester United legend admitted he couldn't bear watching the programme with another child. \"I hate Mr Tumble,\" he said.",
      "\"I was in the dressing room for Match of the Day and he was sat next to me. The reason I hate him, well I don't hate him for what he does, is just that I've had to sit through it four times with every kid.",

      "\"I couldn't have another kid to go through it again.\"",

      "The admission left the studio audience roaring with laughter - as football content creator Steve Bracknell in turn joked: \"There's your headline! Mr Tumble made me have the snip - Rooney.\"",
      "Podcast listeners also shared their own difficulties with the programme.",
      "Rooney underwent the procedure in 2018, not long after welcoming their fourth son, Cass, into the world. During 2023, Coleen confirmed they both believed their family was now complete.",
      "\"Me and Wayne talking about him having a vasectomy,\" she said. \"He said after this baby that's it, we're not having any more, and Wayne went in and got the snip - so I knew for sure we wouldn't have anymore children.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Rooney's eldest son, Kai, is following in his father's footsteps at United's academy.",
      "The 15-year-old has shown promise at youth level and could, potentially, make his bow at Old Trafford in the near future. Kai can play as a striker or winger.",

      "Manchester United have been told they were harshly treated after Jean-Philippe Mateta was permitted to retake his penalty, despite his own error, during their 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon. Ruben Amorim's men netted twice after the half-time break to secure a crucial three points, although not before drama surrounding Mateta's spot-kick.",
      "A clumsy challenge by Leny Yoro on the Palace striker handed him an opportunity to break the deadlock from the penalty spot. Mateta coolly converted his effort, with Senne Lammens diving the wrong way, but replays revealed the ball had accidentally brushed his left foot.",
      "VAR directed Rob Jones to announce to the stadium that Mateta would be permitted to retake the penalty. He said: \"After review, Crystal Palace No.14 touches the ball accidentally twice as the ball goes into the net. The final decision is a retaken penalty.\"",
      "\"What they decided now is because it's accidental and he's scored it's a retake. If he missed, it would've been an indirect free-kick. I think it's only fair. He doesn't mean to slip.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Jay Bothroyd has explained why United should feel aggrieved by Mateta being granted a second opportunity after his blunder. \"I don't agree with that,\" he added.",
      "\"You step up to take a penalty and you plant your foot and touch the ball, it's bad technique. If you take a bad touch, it's just a bad touch. He's planted his foot ahead of the ball and has cut across it.",
      "\"That's his fault. He shouldn't get the opportunity to take it again for his mistake.\"",
      "Had this situation occurred last season, it would have been deemed a missed penalty by Mateta, but Julian Alvarez's contentious double-touch in Atletico Madrid's Champions League shoot-out defeat to Real Madrid prompted Ifab to enter talks with UEFA.",
      "The regulation has since been amended to specify if an accidental 'double-touch' spot-kick finds the net, then it should be retaken rather than disallowed. Fortunately, it didn't prove too crucial, with Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount both finding their mark to swing the match in United's direction.",
      "The triumph at Selhurst Park provided the ideal response to their home defeat against Everton on Monday night, despite enjoying a man advantage for more than an hour. With Palace having featured in France just days before, Amorim acknowledged that factor contributed to their success.",
      "He said: \"It was small details that helped. The pace and intensity was better in the second half. I could see that Palace were getting tired at the end of the first half and knew they would suffer if we scored.",
      "\"We went on to control the game well away from our goal and in the opposition's half. We controlled the game well, but just have to be careful about what we did in the first half.\"",

      "Gary Neville has been accused of ‘killing’ Scott McTominay’s career at Manchester United by Jamie Carragher. The Red Devils academy graduate made 255 appearances for his boyhood club before making a shock move to Italian giants Napoli.",
      "McTominay has shone during his time in Naples, scoring 18 goals in 53 appearances in all competitions. He claimed the Italian title in his debut season and was named the best player in Serie A. Ex-United star Neville has claimed that it might have been an error letting him leave.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Neville said: “What’s happened to Scott McTominay? Have we made a massive mistake?”",
      "Fellow pundit Jamie Carragher replied: “You’ve killed another Man United player, that’s what happened. Too much criticism, [saying] he’s not good enough.”",
      "Ian Wright then chimed in as he said: “I remember Gary saying they’ve got to get rid of him. Poor Scott. He just wanted some freedom.”",
      "However, Neville then insisted that he wasn’t as critical as others thought and suggested that McTominay should have been kept. He added: “I didn’t say he wasn’t good enough… Not me. Seriously I never thought they should have got rid of him. I always said at the time, he’s a squad player, in the 15 or 16. He should never have been got rid of.”",
      "Despite his defence Neville had indeed been critical of McTominay on a number of occasions in the past. Speaking in 2018, he suggested that the Scottish international may have to consider changing his position in order to have a career at Old Trafford.",
      "He said: “McTominay, when I watch him, I’m not sure he’s actually good enough on the ball to be a Man United midfield player.",
      "“I do think he’s the type that it’s good for him to play games in there – but I do wonder whether if actually he’s got more of a position at centre back eventually, the physicality that he has. He’s a big lad. Is he sharp enough on the ball to be a Man United central midfield player?”",
      "McTominay could potentially be celebrating a second league title come the end of the season. Having helped Napoli to the Italian crown last term, Antonio Conte’s men sit second and are only behind leaders AC Milan on goal difference this time around.",
      "McTominay has actually been linked with a move back to the Premier League on a host of occasions. Everton have recently been credited with an interest. His deal with Napoli is set to run until 2028.",

      "Former Manchester United flop Antony was the subject of abuse while watching the chaos-filled Seville derby. The 25-year-old was ineligible to play for Real Betis in their Sunday clash against rivals Sevilla after being sent off a week prior against Girona.",
      "Taking his place in a box in the stands, the Brazilian was present to watch his side earn an impressive 2-0 victory, thanks to goals from ex-West Ham midfielder Pablo Fornals and Sergi Altimira.",
      "Antony, who joined Betis on a permanent deal this past summer after his six-month loan, was spotted supporting his team via footage taken from the stands. The winger was seen taunting the home fans when celebrating one of Betis' goals at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium.",
      "Videos posted across social media platforms showed Antony shouting and raising his arms at Sevilla fans, who retaliated by throwing bottles and other objects at his box. Other fans could be seen gesturing their middle finger at the footballer in what was a fierce atmosphere that eventually boiled over on the pitch.",
      "With Betis 2-0 up and just eight minutes left to go, Sevilla winger Isaac Romero was shown a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on Betis's Valentin Gomez. Romero being given his marching orders only led to further chaos in the stands with bottles and other projectiles being thrown on the pitch.",
      "The rising unrest led referee Jose Luis Mubuera Montero to suspend the game. Proceedings were halted for 15 minutes before the two teams returned and played out the final few minutes of the clash.",

      "After a nightmare three-year stint at Old Trafford, Antony has reignited his once-blossoming career in Spain with 15 goals and eight assists in his 39 appearances for Betis thus far. After leaving United this past summer, the winger said: \"What happened in Manchester, only I know how difficult it was.\"",
      "With six goals in 13 games already this season, the Brazil international has played a huge role in Betis' recent ascendancy but his ill-discipline almost flared up again during their Europa League match against Utrecht.",
      "In the Thursday night game, Antony very nearly picked what would have been a second consecutive red card when appearing to headbutt his opponent, Souffian El Karouani.",
      "The Utrecht left-back went down clutching his head, but the Betis ace escaped a caution. The clash was then sent to review by VAR, but the officiating team also cleared Antony of any punishment.",

      "Despite being unable to hit the ground running at Old Trafford, the 25-year-old ultimately thrived on Spanish soil at the back end of 2024/25, racking up nine goals and five assists across all competitions for the club. As a result of his fine form, Betis opted to make his transfer permanent this summer, securing Antony on a fee of around £21.5million.",
      "This season so far, Antony has managed another six goals and three assists for his new club, in 13 appearances across La Liga and the Europa League. And while he has enjoyed a career turnaround at the Estadio Benito Villamarin, a Spanish football expert has now explained where he believes it all went wrong at United for Antony.",
      "\"It was an obvious case of a player who was down in the dumps at Man Utd, wasn't popular with the fan-base. No one cared if he played or not, if they were a Man Utd fan.",
      "\"Most of them preferred he didn't play. The manager didn't have any faith in him. So when he gets off the plane at Betis and there's a whole host of supporters there waiting to greet him, and the manager picked him and told him how important he was, I just think his self-esteem was back.",
      "\"And he can play. It can be a bit of a joke; 'Oh, Anthony, the league can't be very good if he's scoring goals, blah, blah, blah'. But he's a really good player. He's the second most popular player at Betis, though he's never going to overtake Isco.\"",
      "Gibson had the pleasure of watching Real Betis in the flesh this weekend, on co-commentary duty for Premier Sport 1 as the club ran out 2-0 winners over Sevilla. Pablo Fornals opened the scoring for the club in the second-half, before Sergi Altimira sealed the deal with around 20 minutes left to play.",
      "However, Antony was not included in Pellegrini's squad for the derby, as a result of sustaining a red card against Girona on November 23. In that incident, Antony attempted a late overhead kick, missing the ball completely and accidentally kicking Joel Roca in the head.",
      "While he was initially only shown a yellow card for it, the referee upgraded it to a straight red after a VAR review. As a result, he missed the all-Seville showdown weekend.",
      "It comes as Gibson also highlighted potential problems with Marcus Rashford securing a permanent switch to Barcelona next summer. The 28-year-old is currently enjoying a season-long loan under Hansi Flick at Barcelona, after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "And with the Catalan giants holding an option to make the move permanent come season's end, Rashford's future could be set at the Camp Nou. However, Gibson has highlighted that Barca might struggle to raise the funds, given their struggles in that area.",
      "He said: \"It's not as easy to find £30m for Barcelona as it is normally. But back in the new stadium now, charging a fortune for tickets at the moment, 45,000 at the weekend, it's going to keep creeping up.",
      "\"And then Barcelona, before too long, will be back on a familiar financial footing. And they'll be setting their sights very high to bring back in superstars at Barcelona.\"",
      "Rashford will hope to make an impact in Barcelona's clash with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night, after appearing as a second-half substitute against Alaves this weekend. Barca currently top the La Liga table, just three points ahead of Diego Simeone's side at present - and they will hope to expand that gap when the two teams meet at the Camp Nou.",

He said: “It's been up and down but I think we are in a lot better place, not just me personally but as a group, and we really need to kick on now and win more games. That's the most important thing now.",
      "“A difficult result last game [vs Everton ] but to come back and win today was massively important. Yeah, it's time to really kick on and shoot for those top four positions.”",
      "While United are now setting their sights on the top four, they have already claimed one title this season. Amorim’s side have already scored from a league-high 10 set piece situations - the same amount as table-topping Arsenal.",
      "After finding the net from another, Mount expressed his satisfaction at the Red Devils’ threat from dead balls. He said: “I love being in those situations and you don't always get that many chances in a game, especially in the Premier League. So when that chance is there it's about taking that chance and hitting the target and at least making the keeper make a save.",
      "“How big set pieces are in the game now… yeah, for me hitting the target I'm very buzzing to see it hit the back of the net and to score and most importantly get the three points for the team.”",
      "Mount is not the only one to have expressed the importance of set pieces for United this season. Boss Amorim has also suggested that it would be nonsensical to not practice them - regardless of the opponent.",
      "He said: “It’s so important in our league because it's hard to play against every opponent. You can sense throw-ins, free-kicks, corners, to score a goal and open the game to give confidence to the team. In the Premier League, if you don’t work on set pieces, you are losing the game already.”",
      "United will be aiming to make it back-to-back wins over the coming week. They take on West Ham on Thursday evening ahead of a clash with rock-bottom Wolves the following Monday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly setting their sights on one of Brazil's most exciting defenders, Luis Eduardo. The 17-year-old wonderkid has caught the eye of several top clubs around Europe after the Under-17 World Cup last month.",
      "Eduardo was in action for Brazil in Qatar and was one of the players heavily scouted across the tournament. The South American nation finished fourth in the World Cup, losing on penalties in the semi-final to Portugal.",
      "Spanish outlet AS has claimed that Eduardo's performances have seen him emerge as one of the standout players. The Brazil captain's electric pace has put clubs, including United, on red alert.",
      "The report claims that Eduardo reached 38 km/h for Gremio U20 earlier this year. AS reports that both United and Chelsea have 'already done their homework and are trying to accelerate their pursuit'.",
      "Furthermore, it's reported that both teams have already begun negotiations with Gremio during the Under-17 World Cup, and offers are expected in the coming weeks. However, there could be a hefty price tag to pay.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "In the summer, the centre-back signed a new contract with the Brazilian side that runs until 2028. As part of the extension, a £53million release clause was inserted, a fee for which it is not yet known whether United would be willing to propose.",
      "United have emphasised signing wonderkids with an eye on developing them and using them in the first team. In previous years, the Reds have bought Chido Obi, Sekou Kone and Diego Leon in a bid to bolster their next generation of talent.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also earned plaudits for the trust he places in his younger players. 15-year-old JJ Gabriel has already been invited to train with the first team, with the wonderkid making the headlines over the weekend.",
      "The midfielder scored three goals in a 7-0 win over Liverpool for the Under-18s with silky footwork, dribbling and finishing wowing figures at the football club. Gabriel has been involved in first-team training in recent weeks, with speculation over his senior debut growing by the week.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to become United's youngest-ever Premier League player. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest players to make an appearance for United in the Premier League.",
      "He could even topple the Premier League record held by Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest. The teenager turns 16 next October.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer revealed he was left reeling after being informed he was sacked as Manchester United manager. The former Red Devils boss was appointed caretaker manager at Old Trafford in December 2018, following the sacking of Jose Mourinho.",
      "He was then given the permanent job in March 2019, following a period of successful results - a status he retained until he was fired in November 2021. Solskjaer, who spent 11 years of his playing career at United, oversaw a summer of huge spending in his final summer transfer window, with Cristiano Ronaldo making a triumphant return to Manchester.",
      "The £72million acquisation of Jadon Sancho had fans exciting while Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane was signed after a 10-year spell in Spain. In what was a superb start to the 2021/22 season, United won four of their first five Premier League games.",
      "However, the wheels began falling off for Solskjaer as United fell to five defeats in their next seven games, leaving them seventh in the table. It was a humiliating 4-1 defeat away to Watford that turned out to be the Norwegian's last game in charge, as his sacking was announced the following day.",
      "Speaking four years after his disappointing exit from Manchester, Solskjaer spoke to the BBC and revealed that while his exit was warranted, it no doubt quelled the sadness he felt when being informed of his termination.",
      "Speaking to Kelly Somers, the 52-year-old said of his time at Old Trafford: \"That pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way and that was [by] having great staff around us.",
      "\"[The] environment in and around the club was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work everyday, you need results. We unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Man United and they made a change which is fine.",
      "\"It was sad, we lost to Watford of course and I knew this was more or less the end. [I] drove my family to the airport, they went back to Norway actually and I was going to work. I got a text, 'Ole, I need to see you in my office', and I knew what was going to happen so I rang my wife straight away.",
      "\"'I'll be back, I'll catch you up', I said. I think it's sudden but not surprising. If you don't get results, you do make a change in football but I felt we had something going.\" Taking the United job is a daunting prospect at any time, especially for a manager who hadn't even coached a side in the English top-flight as was the case for Solskjaer.",
      "But even for the most seasoned of bosses, it was a job that proved too pressurised, according to the Norwegian. During the interview with the BBC, he claimed that then-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti said he wouldn't want the United job mid-way through a clash against the Toffees.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "With the likes of Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich on his CV, it was quite the statement from the Italian. Solskjaer explained: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.' And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure.",
      "\"That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.\"",

Recently, the Danish full-back appeared to ridicule Amorim's choice to play Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in a midfield pivot after he 'liked' a post criticising the decision on social media.",
      "While Dorgu being dropped to the bench may have been a disciplinary issue, Amorim set the record straight by confirming why he made the change. The Portuguese boss insisted that he is trying to find a solution to help the defender perform to his true ability.",
      "Amorim said: \"What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games. When I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was different to the decision that he’s making in our team.",
      "\"So I just need to understand the context in trying to help them. I think they are far from the best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I think they have so much more to give. Let’s see this week if we improve that.\"",
      "Highlighting the tension felt on the pitch, he added: \"He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touched the ball — I can feel it, the anxiety.",
      "\"And I remember the shot [missed] against Everton. That was easier than the decision that he had to make when the guys from Scotland were there, when he made a great decision.",
      "\"And I saw it when he played in Italy. But, again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford has fulfilled his dream of playing at the Camp Nou as Barcelona ran out 3-1 winners over Alaves on Saturday. The United loanee made his first appearance at the club's revamped stadium at the weekend, coming on as a half-time substitute in the win.",
      "Rashford has had the image of playing at the iconic stadium in his mind since joining in the summer, stating that it will be an enjoyable experience. At the time, the English forward said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The 28-year-old has impressed so far for the Catalan club, scoring six goals and assisting nine times in all competitions. This includes a stunning double against Newcastle in the Champions League, as well as strikes against Olympiacos, Sevilla and Elche.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "In the midst of a drubbing, there was one moment that symbolised a problem that threatens to undermine everything David Moyes is trying to do. Thierno Barry thought he had finally opened his account for the club when his sliced mis-kick spun past Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Alas, VAR got involved and spotted that Barry had inadvertently set up the chance with his arm. And so, that means Barry, who cost £27million from Villarreal, has played 464 minutes of Premier League football without scoring, without assisting, without registering a single shot on target.",
      "Rightly, the 23-year-old French striker was praised for his physical endeavour in the wins over Manchester United and Fulham and those left inside the stadium gave him a decent ovation when he was substituted late in the hammering by Newcastle United.",
      "His effort, enthusiasm and commitment cannot be questioned. But Moyes is going to need a striker who carries more threat if Everton's season is going to develop into a positive one.",
      "Barry’s struggles are highlighted when Moyes’ defensive operation has an off-day - and it was a major off-day against Newcastle.",
      "“From the get-go, we were very flat,”: said Jake O’Brien. “For periods we were good, but we just left ourselves open at times and gave them too many opportunities, and they took them. We were chasing the game and we left ourselves wide open.",
      "“It is important that we put it behind us and go into Tuesday (Everton are away at Bournemouth) with a positive mindset and come away with three points.”",
      "Moyes refused to use the absence of key midfielder Idrissa Gueye, who was sent off for slapping team-mate Michael Keane in a rare win at Manchester United on Monday, as an excuse for a performance full of holes.",
      "“It could be that, but it could have been the quality of Newcastle United. You mustn’t underestimate them, they’re a Champions League team,” he said. “They got off to a great start, we got off to a terrible start. They were much better than us, played better, and much more experienced than we are.",
      "“You can see Newcastle are learning from the Champions League games. When they had to defend, they are hard to play against and really quick on the counter-attack.",
      "“We were beaten by the better team, there is no doubt about that.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu has expressed his gratitude to the Manchester United faithful following the Red Devils' triumphant return to form against Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon. Ruben Amorim's men fought back from a goal down to secure a crucial 2-1 win at Selhurst Park.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta had given Palace the lead in the opening period, but United struck back after the interval to completely flip the script. Joshua Zirkzee drew the visitors level on 54 minutes with a clever finish before Mason Mount netted the decisive goal just after the hour mark.",
      "The victory propels United up to seventh in the Premier League standings, having amassed 21 points from their first 13 fixtures. They now trail third-placed Chelsea by just three points.",
      "Following United's success in south London, Dorgu turned to Instagram to address the travelling supporters. Posting alongside a snap of himself in action, the left-back wrote: \"Always thankful for the support [red love heart emoji].\"",
      "Having featured from the start in Monday's disappointing 1-0 home reverse to Everton, Dorgu found himself relegated to the substitutes' bench for the game against Palace. Nevertheless, he still managed to see some action, coming on for Amad Diallo during stoppage-time.",
      "Amorim opted to deploy Diogo Dalot at left wing-back with Amad operating on the opposite flank. Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw comprised the defensive trio with Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Zirkzee leading the attack.",
      "Amorim's tactical switch followed remarks he made during a press briefing about Dorgu and the disparity in his performances for Denmark compared to United. \"When I see them training they are doing so much better than in games,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he's scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was completely different to the decision('s) he's making in our team.",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel it, the anxiety.\"",
      "It was Bruno Fernandes who stole the show against Palace, setting up both Zirkzee and Mount as United secured their first victory since October. Casemiro partnered him in the middle of the park with Senne Lammens filling the goalkeeper's jersey.",
      "Looking back on his team's triumph, Amorim appeared relieved. When questioned whether he delivered any tactical instructions at the interval to spark a response from his United squad, the Portuguese manager revealed: \"No, we just wanted everyone to understand the game.",
      "\"I felt in the last 10 minutes of the first half that the opponent was struggling, and that they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling, and we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",
      "\"We tried to change little things in the game - the intensity and the quality in the way we connect, especially Josh [Zirkzee] - he improved a lot the way we played.",
      "\"It was massive,\" Fernandes, meanwhile told MUTV, when asked how big the win was for United. \"We needed the three points after the performance and the result we had last week.",
      "\"We needed a response very quickly. I think first half was not great for us, but the second half was a very big response.\"",

      "Barcelona's sporting director Deco has claimed Marcus Rashford had to shoulder too much responsibility \"too young\" - which ultimately led to his struggles at Manchester United.",
      "The forward, now on loan with the Spanish giants, burst onto the scene as a teenager a decade ago but has been unable to regularly deliver at Old Trafford with his long-term future very much in doubt. He made his debut under Louis van Gaal in 2016 - scoring a brace in Europe.",
      "Rashford's stock rose at a rapid rate but he's already played under five permanent managers in Manchester and, from a young age, was seen as one of the team's leading lights. He was often among the first to be called out when the team fell short, which has been all too regular.",
      "Ruben Amorim appeared to take issue with Rashford's attitude and he's on his second loan spell away from Manchester with Deco claiming he has been forced to take on too much at times whilst the constant upheaval has proven an issue.",
      "He told The Times: “He’s happy with us. Marcus is a fantastic player. He faced the responsibility of becoming an important player at Man United - United, like us, are one of the biggest clubs in the world - too young.",
      "\"He suffered a bit with this change of generation at United too. If you see United in the last five years, they had difficulties rebuilding the team, to become stronger again. He was there. So it’s not easy for a player [from whom] people demand a lot. When you are an important player, you have a lot of responsibility.",
      "“We were looking for a player like him on the market. A player that could play in the three positions up front. We were able to sign Marcus on loan now because of his desire to play for Barcelona. He waited a lot. He knew that we were dealing with financial rules. But he was patient. He waited and we’re happy to have him.”",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rashford's move to Barcelona will become a permanent one, although there is an option in his loan agreement. Despite an abundance of quality in Catalunya Rashford has still proved a worthwhile addition, scoring an impressive brace on his return to England against Newcastle earlier this season.",
      "The United loanee has scored six times during his loan stint and looks to have rediscovered his form away from Manchester. With his boyhood club he has endured huge highs, including a season where he hit the 30-goal mark, but equally been hammered when things have not gone to plan.",

      "Mason Mount demonstrated his leadership qualities as he consoled Leny Yoro following Manchester United's comeback victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday. Despite the win, it was a tough day for young centre-back Yoro who conceded a first-half penalty after fouling Jean-Philippe Mateta in the box.",
      "The forward then successfully converted the penalty, despite having to retake due to a double kick on his initial attempt. However, the match wasn't all doom and gloom as Ruben Amorim's squad rallied in the second half.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee equalised and, ten minutes later, substitute Mount put them ahead for the first time in the match. United managed to hold onto their lead, securing a much-needed victory and breaking a three-match streak without a win.",
      "Following Monday's disappointing 1-0 defeat against a ten-man Everton at Old Trafford, this was a significant step in the right direction.",
      "The season has been testing for 20-year-old Yoro and Sunday's penalty incident only added to his woes. The youngster appeared downcast as he was substituted for Noussair Mazraoui early in the second half.",
      "His disappointment continued post-match, and Mount was quick to comfort Yoro as they left the pitch. He seemed to whisper something to him while placing an arm around his shoulder.",
      "This act of solidarity from the United midfielder was a clear demonstration of leadership, offering support and encouragement to a young teammate experiencing a difficult period.",

      "It may have been freezing conditions near the away dressing room at Selhurst Park at full time, but the jovial mood among the Manchester United squad was keeping spirits warm. Captain Bruno Fernandes joked with Joshua Zirkzee to pull his trousers up while a beaming Luke Shaw spoke at length with veteran commentator Martin Tyler before heading to the team bus.",
      "Ruben Amorim was keen to continue the positive atmosphere as he took one look at the assembled cast of journalists waiting in the mixed zone and teased doing a preliminary press conference before the main event. In the end, he made his apologies and ran up the stairs to the Media Centre.",
      "Match winner Mason Mount's positivity was obvious as he strolled up to the journalists, joking that we were blocking him from exiting. When the laughter subsided, Mount took us into the conversation between himself and Fernandes shortly before the winner.",
      "He explained: \"We always have a little conversation. I said to him: 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said: 'You stay there,' and then I said: 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it...He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption and then hit the target.\"",
      "Sunday was the first time Mount has completed 90 minutes in the league since he was at Chelsea, coincidentally against the same opposition as this weekend. \"It felt like a long time,\" Mount laughed when asked about playing the full game.",
      "\"It is obviously a massive positive for me as well. I have been working hard recently, I feel really good now so to get that 90 minutes under my belt is really positive, it is all about recovery now and going towards the next game.\"",
      "At half-time it felt as though such a light-hearted conversation with Mount was not going to take place. United were poor in the opening 45 minutes and were deservedly behind at the break thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's re-taken penalty.",
      "While United fans may have been panicking, this was not the case for Amorim in the dressing room. Mount said: \"He was saying to keep going, stay calm do what we needed to do. We all knew what to do in that second half.",
      "\"They have just played recently so we felt they could drop off in that second half, there was chances there for us so just carry on what we are doing. Obviously difficult to go down 1-0 but we showed character to get back into the game in the second half.\"",
      "While not the perfect performance, the result is all that matters at this stage for the Reds. They are now back within touching distance of the top four and Mount was clear his desire is now to push on.",
      "He said: \"I have had niggles but nothing bad at all [this season]. I have felt good this season, I had a good pre-season under my belt, I have been working hard in training every week, not just me, but as a group we have been at it, it's up and down but we are in a lot better place me personally and a group.",
      "\"We need to kick on now, win more games and the most important thing is to win, difficult result in the last game but to come back today was massively important. So yeah it is time to kick on now and shoot for those top four positions.\"",

      "As Manchester United applauded the away section at Selhurst Park, Leny Yoro walked with his hood up. Yoro was visibly disappointed with his performance and Mason Mount put an arm around him.",
      "Mount spoke a few words of encouragement to Yoro and patted him as if to say 'don't worry about it'. The defender was brought off in the 54th minute and TV cameras showed him crestfallen on the bench.",
      "Yoro appears to be his own harshest critic. He was aware his performance against Crystal Palace was poor and seemed to be beating himself up, even after the three points were secured.",
      "United now have one choice with Yoro: support him and take him out of the firing line to help restore his confidence. He only celebrated his 20th birthday last month, and every young player is bound to have challenging moments, but what truly matters is how one reacts to adversity.",
      "Yoro's display wasn't a complete surprise after his showing against Everton last Monday, as he'd been one of the culprits in the build-up to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal at Old Trafford.",
      "The warning signs were there in Croydon. Matthijs de Ligt and Yoro got their wires crossed, which led to a sitter for Jean-Philippe Mateta, but Yoro redeemed himself with a superb block to deny Yeremy Pino.",
      "That was until Yoro made a clumsy challenge to concede a penalty. It was the type of tackle made by a player struggling with confidence. Yoro was not in a position to yield a clean challenge and he still attempted to win the ball, which inevitably meant Mateta was fouled in the penalty area.",
      "Yoro probably wouldn't have tried to make that challenge if he were in a better vein of form. He was aware he wasn't playing at his best and was desperate to try to make a difference, which led to a bad decision.",
      "The consensus in the press box during the interval as United trailed 1-0 was they had little chance of winning after an awful 45 minutes, but they reacted in a much-improved second half.",
      "Johsua Zirkzee and Mount scored brilliant goals to wrap up a victory, condemning Palace to a first defeat at Selhurst Park in the Premier League for nine months. Palace grew weary due to their Thursday night exploits, but that should not take away from United's reaction after a dismal first half.",
      "Mount should be lauded for exchanging a few thoughtful words with Yoro after the final whistle. The midfielder comes across as genuine when he speaks to journalists in the mixed zone, and made sure to comfort Yoro when he could have just lapped up the adulation for his goal.",
      "When Yoro recently spoke to reporters at Carrington, he spoke about strong bonds in the dressing room after the decision from Amorim to axe a handful of players in the summer window.",
      "\"This is just one group of friends. This is the best for the team,\" said Yoro. His teammates will support him after Palace and remind him that peaks and troughs are all part of the journey as a player.",
      "Rio Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"This game can send you crazy at times… Use these learnings as fuel. He’s a young player and will bounce back. It's a new day tomorrow.\"",
      "Yoro suffered a bad week and will become a better player for it, because making mistakes is the only way to learn. Amorim was right to bring him off early in the second half, and it's logical to remove him from the spotlight against West Ham on Thursday night to protect his confidence.",
      "Lisandro Martinez made his first appearance since picking up an anterior cruciate ligament injury at the beginning of February and could replace Yoro in the starting team, while Noussair Mazraoui is also an option, along with Ayden Heaven, so there is no need to start Yoro against West Ham.",
      "Giving Yoro a breather after two disappointing performances will do him the world of good. It would be common-sense management of a player who is still young and developing aspects of his game.",
      "There will be a time when Yoro is held to a higher standard, but he wouldn't have been human if he hadn't had a few off days along the way to reaching his full potential. He will come back stronger after Selhurst Park.",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways on Sunday with a 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace. The Reds were slow in the first half and an opener from the home side always looked to be on the cards.",
      "When Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta, the striker gave Palace the lead. United were revitalised after the break and two set pieces made the difference. Fernandes set up Joshua Zirkzee for the equaliser and then laid the ball off for Mason Mount to win it.",
      "After a much-needed three points for United, MEN Sport has taken a look at the moments you may have missed from the game:",
      "Martinez leads the way",
      "Coming onto the pitch before the game, the substitutes arrived around ten minutes after the starting XI. As they emerged, most of the players trudged towards the centre circle. But one man who was definitely ready for action was Lisandro Martinez. He led the way onto the pitch and looked back at his fellow subs as if to demand they picked up the pace. It shows the mentality and standards he is setting.",

      "Casemiro and Henderson reunion",
      "Just before the first big chance of the game, Casemiro took the chance to reunite with Dean Henderson. He clasped hands with the former United goalkeeper. Moments later, the Brazilian gave him a gift as he somehow did not convert from close range.",
      "Special kind of pain",
      "It was a special kind of torture for United as they conceded the opener. The first goal looked fine at first glance, and \"Boom, boom, boom, boom, Mateta's in the room\" was chanted by the home fans.",
      "United fans could be heard chanting ‘What the f****** hell was that?’ but unfortunately for them, VAR ensured another rendition would follow as Mateta converted his second attempt.",
      "Yoro head in hands",
      "After United equalised there were wild scenes in the away end, but Yoro couldn't hide his frustration at his own performance. He had his hands on his head while sitting on the bench after being replaced by Noussair Mazraoui. It has been a difficult week for Yoro but he is still young and he will learn from a tough few days.",
      "Fernandes comes good",
      "After the Everton defeat, Bruno Fernandes will not have been happy with his own performance. However, the theory that when the captain plays well, United play well was clear after this victory.",
      "Fernandes was not in the first half but he led from the front in the second. His two free kicks aside, the Portuguese midfielder impressed with his work rate and set the standard for his teammates - a good afternoon after a rocky start for him.",

      "Manchester United won 2-1 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday. United needed to respond to a shocking defeat against Everton at the beginning of the week and they secured an important win on the road.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring in the 36th minute from the penalty spot. Leny Yoro clumsily brought the forward to the ground and Mateta fired Palace into a well-deserved lead.",
      "United equalised in the second half through Joshua Zirkzee before Mason Mount scored the winner.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Selhurst Park:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty. 3",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Shaw made a great block to deny Palace a two-goal advantage just before half-time. Not much attacking threat came down his side all afternoon, which was a compliment from the hosts. Booked for a professional foul. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Was relocated to right-wing back, where he has looked comfortable, but he wasn't involved with the intricate play he is capable of orchestrating down that side. Could have done better. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Amorim could not believe that Casemiro did not fire United into the lead just a minute into the match. The Brazilian wasted a header from a free-kick, but improved after a shaky start. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes is world-class because he creates something even when he is having an off day. Fernandes was responsible for both of United's assists from set-piece routines. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled by default but made a difference with his long throw-ins, although it would have been difficult to have been a downgrade on Patrick Dorgu after his display against Everton. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo was untouchable before the international break, but he hasn't returned with as much zest. He still worked hard down the right, but he is capable of more in the final third. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made his first start since playing a key role in the win against Liverpool at Anfield. His performance was similar - hard working and industrious, but there was a key difference: he scored. 8",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Offered nothing in the first half, following up a good touch with a bad one, but equalised with a brilliant finish. Zirkzee's half-volley had to be powerful to beat the goalkeeper - and it was. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "He was an improvement on Yoro. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Fine on his appearance since February. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Same as Dorgu. N/A",

      "Manchester United climbed to seventh in the Premier League following a 2-1 comback over Crystal Palace on Sunday. The win was a much-needed win for Ruben Amorim after their disappointment against Everton on Monday, igniting pressure back on the Portuguese.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount were on target as they came from behind to beat Oliver Glasner's side, with the Austrian previously mooted to succeed Amorim. It's a relentless week for United as they take on West Ham in midweek before travelling to strugglers Wolves on Sunday.",
      "The transfer window is now one month away from opening, allowing United to further strengthen their squad before embarking on the business end of the season where European qualification will be a priority.",
      "However, United face several key decisions in January if they are to offload players and open up a budget to reinvest into the squad. Marcus Rashford faces an uncertain future after spending the last season-and-a-half away from the club on loan, he is currently enjoying his spell with Barcelona.",
      "Reports suggest Hansi Flick's side are leading the race for his signature with Paris Saint-Germain also interested.",
      "Elsewhere, Adam Wharton has been suggested to be a candidate to join the midfield options in Manchester. United got a closer look at the in-demand England international on Sunday, with reports suggesting that he could leave Selhurst Park for £70million.",
      "Meanwhile, Xabi Alonso's start to life as Real Madrid has been far from smooth sailing with reports of friction amongst the squad. It has been claimed that Fede Valverde is on United's radar, but they're yet to meet the valuation.",
      "Spanish outlet Defensa Central reports that Antony has emerged on Real Madrid's radar.",
      "Real are said to be monitoring the former United winger as they plan to strengthen their attack in January, following the decision to temporarily offload Endrick.",
      "Andre Onana has suffered a fresh blow with the Manchester United loanee left out of Cameroon's squad for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations tournament. Onana has also made three appearances for Cameroon with two of those fixtures ending in defeat for his national team. The most recent loss came against DR Congo which saw Cameroon out of the running to qualify for next summer's World Cup.",
      "He has since suffered a fresh blow with the decision made and now confirmed via the Cameroon FA's Instagram that he will not be representing his country at AFCON throughout December and potentially January. Instead, Simon Omossola, Devis Epassy, Simon Ngapandouetnbu and Edouard Sombang will be the 'keepers heading to the tournament.",
      "Their caption read: \"Here are the 28 #LionsIndomptables who will defend the colours of Cameroon at the CAN Total Energies Morocco 2025,\" The image included shows small pictures of those set to feature with United's Bryan Mbeumo present.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Napoli are desperate to strengthen their midfield following a number of injuries and have identified Mainoo as a top target ahead of January.",
      "According to reports in Italy, Napoli have already initiated contacts with Mainoo's representatives to secure a 'rapid loan deal.'",
      "It's said that alternatives such as Soungoutou Magassa (West Ham) and Johan Manzambi (Freiburg) are being also considered, though Mainoo 'remains the priority target.'",
      "Man United are reportedly keeping an eye on the situation of Eintracht Frankfurt left-back Nathaniel Brown.",
      "According to Spanish outlet Fichajes, Man United are 'serious' about signing the midfielder and are expected to move quickly should Federico Valverde show any interest in joining the club.",
      "Casemiro will be out of contract at the club at the end of the season, and United are believed to already be exploring potential replacements for the Brazilian.",

      "Sergio Aguero has given his assessment of Marcus Rashford at his old club Barcelona.",

      "\"The only snag is that Evangelos Marinakis’ demands are far higher than City’s valuations so far, and they have refused to offer Nottingham Forest the £100 million. Whatever happens, Anderson will remain in Nottingham in January. His departure is only conceivable after the 2026 World Cup.",
      "\"Considered the future pillar of the Three Lions, Elliot Anderson has already informed his professional circle that he is giving priority to Manchester City for a future transfer.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing up one of Brazil's most promising defenders, 17-year-old Luis Eduardo.",
      "Spanish publication AS has reported that the Brazilian captain's impressive speed has put clubs, including Manchester United, on high alert. The report suggests that Eduardo reached speeds of 38 km/h playing for Gremio U20 earlier this year.",
      "Over the summer, the centre-back signed a new contract with Gremio that runs until 2028. As part of this deal, a £53million release clause was included, and it remains unclear whether United would be willing to meet this fee.",
      "Barcelona chief Deco has spoken highly of Marcus Rashford after his loan spell in Catalonia.",
      "In an interview with The Times, he said:",

      "\"Marcus is a fantastic player. He faced the responsibility of becoming an important player at Man United — United, like us, are one of the biggest clubs in the world — too young.",
      "\"He suffered a bit with this change of generation at United too. If you see United in the last five years, they had difficulties rebuilding the team, to become stronger again.",
      "\"He was there. So it’s not easy for a player [from whom] people demand a lot. When you are an important player, you have a lot of responsibility.",
      "\"We were looking for a player like him on the market. A player that could play in the three positions up front. We were able to sign Marcus on loan now because of his desire to play for Barcelona.",
      "\"He waited a lot. He knew that we were dealing with financial rules. But he was patient. He waited and we’re happy to have him.\"",
      "According to Fichajes, Manchester United are exploring the possibility of appointing Xavi as a replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "It has been said that United are assessing their long-term managerial candidates and the former Barcelona boss is viewed as someone who aligns with their long-term vision.",

      "United are said to want to recoup £36million for the Dutch forward.",
      "Although, it was published before Zirkzee equalised for United on Sunday and opened his account for the campaign.",

      "United are said to be confident of landing the midfielder for £70million.",
      "In doing so, they would beat a host of their rivals to his signature as they plot their latest department rebuild.",
      "In the same article, it was claimed that Man United will block an exit for Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The United academy graduate managed just four minutes after being brought on late against Crystal Palace.",
      "Mainoo expressed his desire to leave the club in the summer but a move didn't materialise and now, he has been forced to endure a frustrating period on the bench - making sporadic appearances.",
      "With the window opening next month, Mainoo will face increasing scrutiny over his future.",
      "Mick Brown has previously claimed that an exit will be blocked.",
      "He said: “They know they made a mistake letting McTominay leave.",
      "“I was aghast at the fact they were even contemplating letting him go given the issues they had in midfield, and he’s done an incredible job since leaving.",
      "“He’s gone away, knuckled down and become an absolute superstar for Napoli and for Scotland.",
      "“But I think Man United have learned from the mistake of letting him go, and they’re going to take a different approach towards Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“There’s been a lot of talk about his future, will he stay, will he go, will the manager give him more minutes or is he going to stay on the fringes?",
      "“As far as the club are concerned, there are no plans to let him go, because they know if he left it would be the same situation we’ve seen with McTominay.",
      "“He would go and impress wherever he went, and all of a sudden everybody would be asking why he wasn’t allowed to do that at Man United.",
      "“So if those offers do come in for him, I’d be very surprised if they allowed him to leave, and I still think he’s a huge part of their plans for the future.”",
      "Football Insider have claimed that Barcelona are favourites to sign Marcus Rashford.",
      "The England international has returned to the world stage at both club and country level after ending his difficult spell at Old Trafford.",
      "The outlet have claimed that Barca are working to make his time at the Nou Camp permanent. Rashford's chances of penning fresh terms with the club have reportedly been boosted after sources told the outlet that Robert Lewandowski's contract would not be extended.",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has \"so much more to accomplish\" in his career after making his 150th appearance in the Premier League against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ruben Amorim questioned his options at left wing-back ahead of the trip to Selhurst Park, admitting Dalot and Patrick Dorgu weren't performing on matchdays as well as they were during training.",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team to face Palace and delivered an improved performance. The Portugal international was the United player with the most duels won and was responsible for winning the foul that led to the second goal, a display which earned praise from Amorim.",
      "When asked whether Dalot's display was the benchmark for a player in that role, Amorim said: \"It's of course defending and attacking. If you have certain characteristics, the pace, you can go right or left because you also can play with your left.",
      "\"You need to use that in every single game in the Premier League and not just one game and then we drop a little bit the level. But it's the same thing that I said with Patrick. I know they have a lot of quality. They just need to be relaxed sometimes and show that and show the intensity and the pace that they have.\"",
      "The game saw Dalot make his 150th appearance in the Premier League, which he said is a source of \"pride for playing at the highest level for so many years”.",
      "Dalot added: “I’m very happy to reach this beautiful milestone in the biggest league in the world. My journey has been one of constant growth as both a man and a player, and I’m proud of what I’ve achieved knowing that I’m only 26 and still have so much more to accomplish in my career. I’m enjoying every moment.”",
      "Dalot started in wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, but he struggled against Nottingham Forest, and Dorgu was recalled to face Spurs before the international break.",
      "The 26-year-old is more comfortable on the right, but has played predominantly at left wing-back this season.",
      "When asked after Liverpool if the victory was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",

      "After VAR demanded a retake due to a double touch, the forward successfully converted the penalty.",
      "However, after half time, United capitalised on their fresher legs. They levelled the score unexpectedly when Bruno Fernandes' free kick found Joshua Zirkzee, who calmly slotted the ball into the net.",

One of centre-backs needs to cover, where middle can't cover. Wing-back forward so far up and can't come back in time. CP plays the same system and plays a lot better.",
      "\"Get rid of Zirkzee. I don't know what he is good at. With his height and weight, at least he can contain the ball, but he can't do it and easily loses the ball. Also, at least, we need to buy 2 middle players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted the role of Manchester United manager is \"tougher than he was expecting\". Amorim recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of him becoming United boss, though there have been times when it seemed he may not reach the milestone.",
      "A five-game unbeaten run helped lift the early-season pressure on the Portuguese head coach, and United are now just three points outside the top four with a home clash with struggling West Ham to come. Amorim reflected on his first year in the job ahead of the win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "\"I think it's not hard to understand what the fans want, first of all, but of course it was a surprise. It's tough, the league is really tough, and everything about our club is so big, it's so different from the other clubs, even the other big ones, so you need to understand that, you need to be really strong mentally.",
      "\"I understand also that we still have a lot to change, because sometimes the small things can become big things, the way we work, behave, all these things, so it was a little bit of a surprise, and it was tougher than I was expecting.\"",
      "Victory at Selhurst Park saw United bounce back from their most disappointing performance of the season against Everton a week ago. Jean-Philippe Mateta put Palace ahead on Sunday from the penalty spot, but second-half goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount ensured United got back to winning ways.",

      "Mason Greenwood has attracted interest from Napoli once again, and a double Manchester United reunion could be possible if the Italian giants revive their pursuit of the player. The former United academy graduate left the club in the summer of 2023 after United concluded a six-and-a-half month investigation and decided 'it would be most appropriate for him' to recommence his career at another club.",
      "Greenwood had been charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour and assault. He always denied all allegations. The Greater Manchester Police announced on February 2 that charges against Greenwood had been dropped.",
      "The 24-year-old joined Marseille the following summer and has made 54 appearances to date for the French club. His stint in France has caught the eye of several clubs, with Calcio Mercato reporting that Napoli are among those interested.",
      "However, Marseille's valuation is said to be over €60million (£53m). Antonio Conte's side tried to sign Greenwood prior to him joining Marseille.",
      "At the time, The Athletic reported that Napoli had made contact over a move but were unsuccessful.",
      "Whether they return to negotiations remains to be seen, but if a move were to happen in the near future, Greenwood would be reunited with Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The latter is currently on a season-long loan at Napoli, with an obligation-to-buy clause included in the deal. If Napoli qualify for the Champions League then he will join in a £38m permanent transfer.",
      "Both players have excelled in Italy, with McTominay establishing himself as a midfield mainstay. Last season, he was named Player of the 2024/25 season.",
      "As for Greenwood, he is an important player for Roberto de Zerbi at the Orange Velodrome and any potential January transfer would prove difficult.",
      "\"He has the qualities to become one of the best players in the world,\" said the Italian coach. \"He's incredibly talented, but he still needs to be even more useful for the team.",
      "\"I want to protect him because I don't like seeing him criticised – he's scored a lot of goals, he's never missed training, and he still has room to grow.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be looking for a reaction on Sunday when his team travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League. The fixture is a difficult one after such a disappointing result against Everton on Monday evening.",
      "However, United have an advantage given Oliver Glasner's side played on Thursday night at Strasbourg in the Conference League with a host of first-team players featuring in the 2-1 defeat. While the Reds also enter the game on the back of a defeat, they will have had six days to prepare.",
      "United will be without Benjamin Sesko. His knee injury suffered in the draw at Tottenham Hotspur is a few weeks away from healing. The Slovenian could be back by the time Bryan Mbeumo and Amad leave for AFCON.",
      "As for the other team news, Amorim confirmed Matheus Cunha will be expected back for the fixture against West Ham but the trip to Palace is a game too soon for him. Harry Maguire also remains absent. So with this in mind, take a look at how our United writers think the Reds should line-up vs Palace.",
      "The absence of Maguire and Cunha is a blow, but Palace were in action in France on Thursday night and there is no excuse for the United players not to produce a response to the Everton defeat.",
      "Amorim said he senses \"anxiety\" from Dorgu when he picks up the ball. The options at left wing-back are not ideal, but I would recall Dalot to the side at Selhurst Park.",
      "The injury news opens the door for Mainoo to make his first Premier League start of the season with Fernandes in the false nine role. Zirkzee is not good enough to lead the attack for United in the league.",
      "United experimented with Zirkzee as the centre-forward against Everton. They should not replicate that at Palace - it did not work.",
      "Mbeumo has experience playing as a centre-forward so starting him as the false nine could work well for the Reds. Amad can play at right wing-back and pushing Bruno Fernandes into the No.10 role alongside Mason Mount is the best option. THat would open the door for Mainoo to make his first Premier League start of the season partnering Casemiro in the middle.",

      "Ruben Amorim has dropped Patrick Dorgu from Manchester United's starting line-up against Crystal Palace. It comes after the defender appeared to mock him on social media.",
      "Earlier this month, Dorgu's Instagram account 'liked' a post criticising Amorim's team selection, leading to speculation about tension between the two.",
      "The post includes a screenshot of a comment from X reading: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "There is no definitive proof that Amorim's choice was influenced by Dorgu's online activity. Still, the Denmark international had started United's previous two fixtures - a 1-0 defeat by Everton on Monday and a 2-2 draw with Tottenham.",
      "Diogo Dalot has taken his place at left-wing back, with Amad Diallo deployed on the right in front of a back-three consisting of Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro. Dorgu, meanwhile, must settle for a spot on the bench.",
      "\"They trained really well, the others too. Then the tactical aspect. Mason Mount is really smart, gives us more possession. He is intense, he can score goals so is one more player to be near the box.\"",
      "This follows Amorim acknowledging that Dorgu, who squandered a golden opportunity to equalise against Everton, is experiencing a confidence crisis. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" the Portuguese manager explained.",
      "\"When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he's making in our team. I think it's the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "\"I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve.\"",
      "Dorgu was Amorim's first significant signing at United, joining from Lecce for £25million midway through last season. He quickly became a regular starter, with Amorim confident in using him as the side's sole out-and-out wing-back.",
      "Nevertheless, spells of inconsistent performances have tempered some of the initial enthusiasm surrounding his arrival. After starting five of United's opening league matches this season, he was relegated to the bench for the next four.",
      "Although he returned to the starting XI against Tottenham earlier this month, a lacklustre showing against Everton appears to have pushed him further down the pecking order once more.",
      "United will be desperate for three points after failing to win their last three league games. Monday's loss to Everton ended a five-match unbeaten streak, United's longest under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils go into the match sitting 12th in the table. A win could see them rise as high as fifth, but defeating Crystal Palace will be a tough challenge.",
      "United have not won at Selhurst Park since 2020 and are without victory in their last four clashes with the Eagles. Their most recent meeting finished in a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford in February, with Jean-Philippe Mateta scoring twice in the second half.",

      "Bendito Mantato opened the scoring early on with a driven finish before Gabriel then took centre stage. His first was a superb effort where he twisted and turned inside the box to bamboozle the home defence before firing home. And his second was in a similar vein with a powerful finish into the roof of the net to make it three.",
      "Louie Bradbury, returning from injury, netted the fourth while Jim Thwaites converted a penalty to make it five. Liverpool were shellshocked and Samuel Lusale added a sixth before Gabriel crowned his fine afternoon with his third and United's seventh.",

      "Gabriel has spoken to Amorim, with the United boss discussing his philosophy and stressing the importance of working hard. Omar Berrada (CEO) and Jason Wilcox (director of football) were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and fans have speculated when he could make his senior debut.",
      "The 15-year-old has the potential to become United's youngest-ever Premier League player. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest players to make an appearance for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record held by Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",

      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Man Utd have made a record-breaking ‘offer’ to sign Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new signings in the summer transfer market with priority given to improvements in attacking areas.",
      "After being the fifth lowest scorers in the Premier League last term, Man Utd brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to try and solve their goalscoring woes.",
      "But many Man Utd supporters and former players thought failing to sign a new midfielder in the summer was a massive mistake after their issues last term.",
      "The Red Devils did make enquiries for Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba but in the end nothing concrete came from those talks.",
      "And now reports in Spain indicate that Man Utd want to ‘repeat the Casemiro deal’ – which seems a bit strange considering he’s mainly flopped at Old Trafford – by making an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid midfielder Valverde.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Foden, Frank, Sunderland, Paqueta, Arsenal and more…",
      "Man Utd are offering ‘a fixed fee of €100 million plus €20 million in add-ons to try and lure one of the most complete, physically imposing, and decisive players in world football away from Real Madrid’.",
      "The €120m (£105m) fee would be a record-breaking deal for the Red Devils, whose biggest ever purchase was the £89m they paid to Juventus for Paul Pogba in 2016, and INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘want to build a project with Valverde as its cornerstone and don’t hesitate to place him among the most expensive signings in the club’s history.’",
      "There could be a lot of change at Man Utd over the next couple of transfer windows as the Red Devils look to cut their current wage bill – but former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson doubts it will reduced as much as some think.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I don’t think United are going to cut £100m off the wage bill. Wage bills always come down slower than people think. United have already cut the wage bill quite aggressively.",
      "“Every team has got players who are surplus to requirements who you go, ‘Well, of course, we’ll sell these players in the summer and then the wage bill will just collapse and we’ll have a tiny wage bill’. It just never works that way.",
      "“First of all, you can’t always get rid of these players. Some of them come back.",
      "“There’s an interesting situation with Sancho.",
      "“I think he’s got a one-year option that United talked about exercising, but they probably won’t exercise it, so maybe he’ll go for free.",
      "“I think they will probably sell Mainoo, but then that’s more of a profit and not really a massive wage saving because he won’t be on top-tier wages.",
      "“They’ll probably end up keeping Casemiro rather than shipping him out. They’ll probably end up keeping Bruno Fernandes. They’ll probably end up doing a deal to keep Maguire. They might be on reduced salaries, but they’re not going to go to zero. They’ll just trim 25 per cent off.”",

      "Thomas Frank lands himself another spot in the losers alongside Lucas Paqueta, Bournemouth and Everton. How they all wish they could be Sunderland.",
      "But let’s be honest: you’re only here to see which arbitrary section Arsenal have been put in so you can properly word the furious comments that will never be read.",
      "",
      "Chelsea indiscipline probably ought to be addressed at some point but the genuine growth and maturity in their manager and players in such a short space of time has been impressive.",
      "The Blues have had four players sent off since that abhorrent response to an early red card against Manchester United in September and collapse after a red card against Brighton the following week.",
      "That is a problem in itself, and many of those were late on with games already largely settled.",
      "But this was a substantial development. Chelsea lost their best player after 38 minutes against the best team in the league and perhaps world, yet were still the better side thereafter as a result of the coming-of-age of those who managed to stay on the pitch, and the decisions the manager made in response.",
      "",
      "Even Regis Le Bris can’t be sure “what we can achieve this season”. But there is one certainty with Sunderland: “This team has a strong character and they want to fight.”",
      "That much was evident against Bournemouth, which in itself was a neat microcosm of their season. Sunderland have salvaged more points from losing positions than any Premier League club in 2025/26, and here were three more rescued in historic fashion.",
      "Never before in 621 Premier League games had they come from two goals down to win. Yet even when Bournemouth capitalised so ruthlessly on a couple of individual errors in the first 15 minutes it never really felt as though Sunderland were out of it.",
      "As Le Bris said, they have mastered how to “change the dynamic”, to “reset” and to “find solutions”, either from the dugout or on the pitch through the guidance and experience of Granit Xhaka, Nordi Mukiele, Reinildo or any of the numerous other leaders emerging in this squad.",
      "It is a neat trick – remarkable for a promoted club under a manager new to the Premier League, really – to be able to compartmentalise situations and setbacks and respond so emphatically. Sunderland following all three of their defeats so far with a win in the next game (a feat only Arsenal can match and they’ve lost just once) is no happy accident.",
      "",
      "It sums up their early-season malaise that consecutive Premier League wins have lifted Fulham from 15th to 15th. But the complexion of their campaign has transformed: they are closer to a Champions League qualification place than the relegation zone in terms of points.",
      "Marco Silva has landed on a happy balance: the defence is settled; the Iwobi-Berge midfield axis is working; the competition for places in the attacking positions buzzing behind and around the centre-forward is healthy; and Raul Jimenez is still playing that line-leading role impeccably.",
      "When they start as rapidly as in north London and fortune favours that bravery, it is difficult to work out quite why they have struggled so fundamentally this season.",
      "Silva credited “the Nigerian boys” for fostering “a great atmosphere” within the squad, and singled out one soaring Super Eagle.",
      "Samu Chukwueze has been Fulham’s best and most decisive player in consecutive games. He leads the entire league for touches in the opposition penalty area per 90 of those who have played more than a handful of minutes, and Spurs could not handle him.",
      "That £21.9m loan option might just be explored; the outcome of Silva’s ongoing contract negotiations could depend on it.",
      "",
      "It’s mad how an atrocious career move to Saudi Arabia will change your view on things. He is thriving at Brentford.",
      "",
      "The only man to play 300 games, score 100 goals and assist 60 more under Pep Guardiola has, by Foden’s own admission, “become more mature” and “one of the leaders” at Manchester City.",
      "Recent evidence of that promotion has been scant. Foden did impress in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund last month but his last proper scruff-of-the-neck performance might have been as far back as Brentford in January, or the final day of 2023/24.",
      "Foden started something Manchester City inexplicably couldn’t finish and ultimately needed him to. Pep Guardiola has been calling seemingly all season for someone to help Erling Haaland with those bags and finally his prayers were answered.",
      "The previous latest goal to put Manchester City in the lead in the Premier League this season was scored in the 61st minute against Burnley. Some stoppage-time heroics – and Foden being the one to conjure such majesty – was long overdue.",
      "",
      "Rough calculations suggest Nick Woltemade scoring from an Anthony Elanga pass is the second-most expensive goal combination of two summer signings this season behind Benjamin Sesko setting Bryan Mbeumo up against Brighton in October.",
      "Newcastle signing Woltemade and Elanga in part because both those players chose Manchester United instead adds another delicious layer of narrative.",
      "Another interesting Woltemade line: his six domestic goals so far have all been assisted by different players. Newcastle diversifying their supply line is no bad thing.",
      "",
      "Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance? Probably not; can’t even instinctively tell you the name of their set-piece coach for a start.",
      "But they are definitely on the right track towards, well, something. Which is more than can be said for the last few years.",
      "The Everton defeat was an abomination, but it seems increasingly like the exception to a new rule the club is trying to implement. Even against Palace they were poor for large periods of the game and could have been further behind at half time.",
      "Yet that only reinforces how things are changing slowly under Amorim. Where once they would have been swept away by that sort of storm, this group is learning how to weather it and emerge for the better.",
      "That was the first time they had ‘won’ a second half in the Premier League all season, and it earned them three valuable points with two more players stepping up from the periphery.",
      "",
      "Returning to the scene of his lowest day as Brighton manager must have been difficult but Hurzeler underlined how quickly he learns his lessons; oh to be 32 again.",
      "Brighton had far less of the ball than in that 7-0 thrashing by Nottingham Forest in February, but more shots and, ultimately, purpose.",
      "The painfully long overdue dropping of Carlos Baleba allowed a promising Gomez-Ayari midfield partnership to blossom from the start, before Hurzeler reinforced his position as the leading substitute maker in the Premier League through the introduction of Stefanos Tzimas to seal victory.",
      "Brighton have scored eight goals from the bench in the Premier League this season, at least three more than any other club. That attacking depth is probably the best in the division.",
      "",
      "Of bloody course some of his half-time team talk consisted of citing specific games from February 2025 and December 2023 as a warning to his players about complacency. And of bloody course it worked.",
      "Not sure how Villa are fourth with seven wins in their last eight Premier League games, but having checked a few times over they certainly appear to be.",
      "",
      "Should the best 45 minutes of Leeds’ season override what was probably their worst immediately beforehand, as well as the three hilariously insipid defeats which preceded it?",
      "There is a case to argue that the second-half transformation the visitors underwent at the Etihad actually emphasised why Farke should be sacked rather than strengthening any few remaining arguments for him to stay. Why did it take so long to try something like this?",
      "For so long Leeds have needed a variation on a tired, failing blueprint, with the desire for a different approach painfully obvious. The minute Farke reverts to his beloved 4-3-3, the axe should swing.",
      "But this was finally proof that he can adjust and adapt, even if it was entirely forced by the prospect of a defeat so chastening that unemployment was the only feasible outcome at half time.",
      "When the barrel is staring down at you so forebodingly, it’s almost easier to chuck Dominic Calvert-Lewin on, stick two up top, call for more physicality and go for it with nothing to lose. The real test will be how he sets up from the start against Chelsea in midweek.",
      "But even if Farke, as still expected, is deemed not to be the man who can liberate Leeds, he will always have that second half and what was presumably a barnstorming but beautifully softly-spoken team talk.",
      "",
      "His middle name is Dave. What more do you want? Fine…",
      "",
      "They realistically belong in the undefined, murky, grey area between winners and losers, such is the nature of a draw against an opponent reduced to 10 men for about an hour.",
      "But also Arsenal were without both first-choice centre-halves, their chief creator and their main centre-forward for most of the match, which came at the end of a week in which they had already beaten Spurs and Bayern Munich quite handily.",
      "It is becoming the go-to cliche of this iteration of Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal, but they probably lose that game in seasons gone by.",

      "",
      "Another deeply problematic response to another inadequate performance and result, with another historically mid-table manager being crushed by the scrutiny and weight of expectation higher up the ladder.",
      "That was an opportunity Frank earned but one he has equally wasted thus far. The temptation with coaches overachieving further down the food chain is to wonder what they might be capable of with better players, greater facilities and more resources; the mistake is in forgetting to contemplate whether their style and philosophy can be successfully transposed at a grander level.",
      "The overwhelming evidence is that what worked so wonderfully for Brentford simply cannot at Spurs. Fulham have joined Bournemouth in recording their only Premier League away win this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It remains the only venue Wolves have scored in or taken a point from as visitors in 2025/26.",
      "Frank can moralise over what makes a “true Tottenham fan” if he wishes, but it might be an idea to show he is capable of becoming a true Tottenham manager at some point.",
      "",
      "Far be it from anyone to speculate and pontificate about how others should act in such a high-pressured situation. But also needling away at the referee in such a sustained manner as to receive two bookings and ultimately a red card for double dissent, having endured almost two years of an investigation over alleged deliberate cautions which Paqueta himself has claimed derailed his career and impacted his mental health, feels inadvisable. Like, specifically so. As outlined by his legal team.",
      "It was also a bit strange to see Alisson, Cody Gakpo and Curtis Jones make roughly as much effort calming Paqueta down and keeping him away from Darren England as the Brazilian’s West Ham teammates.",
      "Put it this way: if I was Paqueta, I simply would not pick up two suspensions in three games. Even if I did play for West Ham.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola did acknowledge “a part where we have to look at ourselves”, pinpointing Bournemouth’s poor record at conceding from set-pieces in particular.",
      "But not sure claiming the referee “absolutely lost control” when it was he and his side who so specifically did as such really works as a post-match narrative. Being beaten after leading 2-0 and investing time in anything other than introspection only ever comes across, as Iraola said, like the actions of a “bad loser”.",
      "Bournemouth have conceded more goals than all but the bottom four. That’s not poor Tim Robinson’s fault.",
      "",
      "The true consequences of Idrissa Gueye’s actions might have been delayed, but only for so long.",
      "David Moyes and Ruben Amorim actively praising the literal fight shown by the midfielder at Old Trafford always seemed at least slightly disingenuous. Everton holding out for that win reflected well only on the players who managed not to slap a teammate, and abysmally on the hosts who failed to take advantage.",
      "Everton were considerably worse with 11 men against Newcastle than 10 on Monday. Gueye’s absence sapped their energy and solidity and without that flashpoint to bring them together, it was as disjointed a performance as the Hill Dickinson has seen.",
      "With the Senegalese out for two more games and then away on international duty at AFCON soon after, this was a humbling insight into how that period could look for Everton.",
      "Tim Iroegbunam had been quietly impressive but floundered when thrust into that role, making a single tackle before being substituted at half time.",
      "Yet beyond him there is no obvious understudy to Gueye or solution to the problems he leaves behind. It turns out that being so dependent on a 36-year-old might not be the best idea. Or that ‘James Garner’ is not the answer to every question mankind has ever posed.",
      "",
      "No club in the entire Premier League has a worse defensive record in any quarter-hour segment of games from 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75 and 76-90 than Burnley in the final 15 minutes.",
      "Scott Parker’s side have conceded ten goals in those closing stages, with draws against Manchester United, Liverpool, West Ham and Brentford turned into defeats.",
      "Be it substandard game management, poor resilience, inadequate concentration levels or lacklustre fitness – and all four seemed to be a factor against Brentford – that is a trend of dropping points that Burnley really cannot afford to let fester.",
      "",
      "Alvaro Morata’s Pro Evo counterpart continues to imbue about as much confidence as the real thing would in central defence.",
      "Morato’s crime of not being Murillo is forgivable. But the numbers are stark: in his nine most recent Premier League starts dating back to last season, Forest’s record is W0 D2 L7 F5 A18. And some of that run includes when they were good.",
      "The last league game Forest won with Morato starting was the 7-0 at home to Brighton in February; this was not quite the same. After marking thin air for the first goal – with others far more culpable – his brace of weak header back to the keeper and curious choice of backheeling the ball into the path of Stefanos Tzimas will have had the City Ground sports science department quadrupling their order of cotton wool to wrap Murillo in.",
      "As Sean Dyche almost definitely said in the dressing room afterwards: Domo Arigato, Mr Morato.",
      "",
      "Oliver Glasner is very much in broken territory at this point about Crystal Palace’s subdued level of investment in the summer after winning the FA Cup and qualifying for Europe for the first time.",
      "But you also do understand where he’s coming from when you consider Palace’s record in Premier League games played after Conference League matches in midweek: P6 W1 D2 L3 F6 A6.",
      "All eight of the points they have dropped from winning positions this season have come in games after playing in Europe midweek. That solitary win came in August.",
      "As the schedule has congested since then, the lack of proper squad depth has been exposed. Glasner has made the fewest substitutions of any manager who has been in place all season; he is still six behind Vitor Pereira.",
      "",
      "Seven defeats in eight Premier League games, and now one win in 19. The last player to score a top-flight goal under Edwards was Alfie Doughty, who spent most of the weekend on the Millwall bench.",
      "It cannot possibly have been an appointment made on the proviso that Edwards might actually achieve safety, and there have been improvements in the two Wolves matches he has overseen.",
      "But that is sustained miserable form which slightly undermines his idea that Wolves merely need to “carry on performing like that and points will come”. Not to go full What’s He Know About The Premier League but, well, yeah.",
      "",
      "It is not December 2022, and thus Emi Martinez is not “probably the best goalkeeper in the world”.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have made a Thomas Frank ‘sack decision’ as they are linked with a long-term target as a replacement.",
      "Lucas Paqueta is not getting any sympathy even from the woke folk while Arsenal fans do not really know how to feel.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Fans always think their ‘system’ has finally clicked when in reality they’re just playing West Ham. But also Joe Gomez is the truth for Liverpool.",
      "How much time has Thomas Frank got at Tottenham? And who is waiting for take the job if Spurs run out of patience?",
      "Jordan Henderson really did make an absolute hash of his Liverpool exit, but two years and some atrocious career moves later he is back and relevant again."

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Chelsea) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Aston Villa) – £45m",
      "5th (Brighton) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Sunderland) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Manchester United) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Liverpool) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Crystal Palace) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Brentford) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Bournemouth) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Spurs) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Newcastle) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Everton) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Fulham) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Nottingham Forest) – £13.3m",
      "17th (West Ham) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Leeds) – £7.9m",
      "19th (Burnley) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",
      "MORE ON PREMIER LEAGUE SPENDING FROM F365\n👉 Premier League net spend table over the last five years\n👉 The biggest spender in every Premier League season – and how they fared",
      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (21 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £18.5m in 2024/25",
      "3rd) Nottingham Forest (20 games) – worth around £17.7m",
      "=4th) Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle (19 games) – worth around £16.9m",

      "20th) Burnley (9 games) – worth around £8.5m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Lucas Paqueta is not getting any sympathy even from the woke folk while Arsenal fans do not really know how to feel.",
      "Thomas Frank lands himself another spot in the losers alongside Lucas Paqueta, Bournemouth and Everton. How they all wish they could be Sunderland.",

      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Anderson is on a list of ten non-Big Six stars primed for a transfer in 2026, but he is far more likely to leave Forest in the summer than in January.",
      "The former Newcastle United star has had an extraordinary rise since departing his boyhood club, establishing himself as one of the finest defensive midfielders in Europe and a near-certain starter for England at next summer’s World Cup.",
      "Anderson‘s sudden rise is a huge boost for England as he provides a fix in a problem position, and Man Utd appear to hope that he can have the same effect on Amorim’s team.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the Red Devils are crying out for a top-tier No.6 to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement, and Anderson is widely reported to be a preferred target with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and/or Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "READ: Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance?",
      "Man Utd’s willingness to test Brighton’s resolve over £100m-rated Baleba in the summer proves they are aware that they need to sign a new defensive midfielder soon, with Anderson standing out as a perfect fit.",
      "Unfortunately for Man Utd, a January deal involving Anderson has never been likely. This is presumably why they are also reportedly looking at Wolves’ Joao Gomes as a potential low-cost target until they can sign a midfielder of a higher level and price bracket in the summer.",
      "With Anderson, Forest are bound to put financial obstacles in the way of a winter exit as they will know it would be foolish to sell their best player while they are far from safe from relegation and are hoping to progress deep into the Europa League.",
      "Anderson, too, should be against a January move because he would be in a far stronger negotiating position and would have more options once he’s presumably shone as a key player for England at a World Cup.",
      "So it was confusing when it was reported last month that the Red Devils are ‘confident’ of signing Anderson in January for a cut-price fee worth around £70m.",
      "Unsurprisingly, this nonsense report has now been exposed by an update from journalist Sacha Tavolieri, while Man City’s interest is another blow for Man Utd.",
      "Tavolieri claims Man City are ‘in love with Anderson’, while he is ‘giving priority’ to Pep Guardiola’s side over other teams. Also, the ‘only snag’ for this deal is something anyone with their head screwed on was already aware of.",
      "‘The only snag is that Evangelos Marinakis’ demands are far higher than City’s valuations so far, and they have refused to offer Nottingham Forest the £100 million.",
      "‘Whatever happens, Anderson will remain in London in January. His departure is only conceivable after the 2026 World Cup.’",
      "Man Utd (and others) put Newcastle United in their box in the summer window, though Arsenal, Chelsea, Vikor Gyokeres and Liam Delap proved where the Red Devils are in the pecking order, so Anderson’s reported transfer stance is justified.",
      "And while it is conceivable that United outbid City to gain favour for Anderson, it would still take a large portion of next year’s budget to sign him, and they have no hope of landing when a new midfielder is ideally required in January.",
      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100m for Elliot Anderson after Man City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will not be signing Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘confident’ that they can seal a cut-price deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes thinks Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson would be a “really good signing” for Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘decided’ who is at the ‘top of the list’ as they look to sign a new midfielder in 2026.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly entered the race to sign Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson with the Gunners ‘not backing down’ over his price tag."

      "“I do think he’s the type that it’s good for him to play games in there – but I do wonder whether if actually he’s got more of a position at centre back eventually, the physicality that he has. He’s a big lad.",
      "“Is he sharp enough on the ball to be a Man United central midfield player?”",
      "McTominay has been linked with a return to the Premier League with Everton but former Man Utd striker Louis Saha reckons the Scot should be aiming for Real Madrid or another top team in world football.",

      "“I think he’s playing out of his skin right now at Napoli. I think a Premier League return might be right for him down the line, but right now I don’t see it – especially not to Everton.",

      "Newcastle boss Eddie Howe was also full of praise for Barnes, he said: “Two great goals for Harvey, he missed a couple in the first half, but he is always a player that gets chances, and that is the great thing about him. When you put him on the team sheet, you know there is going to be some moments.",

      "The Dutch forward has not had an easy time of things since moving to Old Trafford in a £36.5m (€42.5m, $49.5m) deal from Bolonga in summer 2024. While he scored on his debut, a 1-0 win over Fulham at the start of the 2024/25 campaign, Zirkzee has netted only eight times in his 56 appearances for United, while just three assists show he’s not really good enough to play as a No.10 either.",
      "However, the 24-year-old spent the recent international break preparing for his big opportunity in the team as Manchester United reacted to Benjamin Sesko’s injury.",
      "Amorim has always admired Zirkzee on a technical level, but has been unsure how to fit him into the team’s plan.",
      "However, after spending a lot of time coaching the player and working on his game in a programme designed to not just work out his role for the club but how they could unlock his full potential within the current set-up, United and Amorim are now starting to see their efforts bear fruit.",
      "And while Zirkzee has been linked with a move away – and Roma are confirmed admirers of the player and are very much open to a January deal if an arrangement could be agreed – this spell was always viewed as a pivotal period in determining his future.",
      "If it had gone badly, then United were willing to open up to a departure. However, he scored a good goal in the 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday, and sources are now suggesting that Amorim is now very much keen to keep him for the rest of the season.",
      "IN-DEPTH 🔴⚫ Five strikers Man Utd could target in the January transfer window as Zirkzee Plan B",

      "“It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball, so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "The game also saw Kobbie Mainoo enter the action as a 90th-minute substitute, meaning he has still only played 170 minutes of action in the Premier League this season – and all eight of his appearances have come off the bench, with none as a starter.",
      "Also strongly linked with a January departure, the midfielder still faces a fight to get a move to another team in January, with Amorim only willing to sanction his exit if a replacement is signed first.",
      "Zirkzee, meanwhile, had played just 82 minutes combined across this Premier League season leading into the last international break, but has played the full 90 minutes of their last two games.",
      "As a result, Amorim is aware that it only takes one injury for the situation to change; hence the manager’s unwillingness to let the 20-year-old midfielder leave without a fight.",

      "On the subject of potential new midfielders, United have been given a golden opportunity to sign Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher, as speculation ramps up over a potential January switch to Old Trafford.",
      "As reported by TEAMtalk transfer insider Fraser Fletcher, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson top the shortlist.",
      "But the trio will all command fees north of £70m, perhaps even as high as £100m, so their potential signings will likely have to wait until next summer.",
      "Wharton, meanwhile, showcased exactly why United should move for him with an outstanding first-half display in Palace’s 2-1 defeat to the Red Devils, and with sources able to shed light on the likelihood of a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "In other news, a shock report claims United have presented a ‘contract offer’ to Antoine Semenyo, after holding a meeting with his representatives on Wednesday last week.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",

      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for a Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top five after 13 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton, though.",

      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after runs of four straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs go to Newcastle – where their recent record is utterly horrific – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ does anything more than delay the inevitable ahead of Chelsea, before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘seriously considering’ a Tottenham Hotspur target replace head coach Ruben Amorim for three reasons.",

      "A game which allowed for a like-for-like comparison between managers and players in the same system saw Ruben Amorim and Manchester United overwhelmingly pale in that comparison to their Crystal Palace counterparts in the first half, before they took full advantage of their hosts’ malaise after the break to claim victory.",
      "As Jean-Philippe Mateta bulldozed his way through the United defence the ball was frequently seen bouncing off Joshua Zirkzee on at the other end, as Maxence Lacroix treated the maligned Red Devil’s attacking presence with the disdain it deserved with a dominating display completely at odds with that of Matthijs de Ligt, who shrunk in the presence of the Palace striker.",
      "Luke Shaw continued to ‘amble’ and so too did Marc Guehi, but the latter in a peak Virgil van dijk ‘I’m better than you’ sort of way rather than the former’s tribute to the current ‘his legs have gone’ iteration of the Liverpool captain.",
      "The most damning contrast came in midfield, where Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes routinely played passes to where teammates could and perhaps should have been but weren’t, often into spaces actually occupied by Crystal Palace players, as Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada showed them how that midfield pivot can function effectively.",
      "Wharton is inarguably the star man in the pairing. His excellent round-the-corner pass for Mateta before Leny Yoro tumbled into the striker to concede the penalty was one of many examples in the first half of his forward-first desire and ability.",
      "As both Casemiro and Fernandes dawdled on the ball, Wharton – and to a lesser but still notable extent Kamada – didn’t hand their opposite numbers the opportunity to catch them in possession as they did to them. It works because, unlike the United duo, they can both do everything, albeit with varying levels of quality.",
      "Mateta could easily have scored a couple more and Palace really should have been at least two up at the break as Eddie Nketiah ran in sand to deny himself a clear opportunity to score in stoppage-time. A United comeback looked incredibly unlikely.",
      "They were better in the second half and showed plenty of the “fight” Amorim was desperate for after the defeat to Everton. Crucially, they were playing for the manager.",
      "But it did feel as though their superiority was more down to Palace’s dwindling reserves of energy than their own uptick in intensity.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s side hadn’t won any of their previous three Premier League clashes after Thursday night Conference League commitments, losing to Everton and Arsenal, and drawing with Brighton. And they looked as though they had quite simply run out of gas after their 2-1 away defeat to Strasbourg.",
      "Eight of the starting XI for the midweek game started here and while Wharton only played an hour in France, his downturn in the second half was as notable as anyone’s, and he was hooked with 15 minutes to go here as Palace searched for an equaliser after Casemiro and Fernandes wrestled control in the second half.",

      "Zirkzee wouldn’t have emerged for the second half had Amorim had any options on the bench to replace him. He probably wouldn’t have been playing if that had been the case. But it was a glorious finish from Fernandes’ free-kick as he controlled on his chest and smashed the ball across Dean Henderson from a tight angle.",
      "He’s not the answer for United, as he made abundantly clear through much of what he did in this game. But he made the difference in a moment, as Mason Mount did with a drilled shot after a short Fernandes pass from another free-kick to draw United level with Arsenal at the top of the charts with ten goals from set pieces this term.",
      "And in what Arsenal have shown to be a tried-and-tested method of picking up Premier League wins for much of this season, United followed up their set-piece goals with some solid defending.",
      "Has Amorim therefore in fact got United on the same path imperiously trodden by Mikel Arteta’s side on their way to Premier League dominance? They played similarly safe, often boring football before a recent surge in quality and impact from open play.",
      "The lack of any distinguishable attacking pattern whatsoever suggests that if that is the case there’s a helluva way to go a year on from Amorim’s appointment.",
      "But at the very least, in what should be a given but hasn’t been and certainly wasn’t in the first half here, United won this game by – as Amorim said afterwards – “fighting for every ball”, albeit against an opponent with little fight left in them.",

      "Manchester United are widely expected to target new wing-backs in the transfer market as Ruben Amorim has struggled to find a workable solution for either flank this season, and after giving a brutal assessment of Patrick Dorgu on the back of the Dane’s ill-advised use of social media this week, the Red Devils manager’s team selection for the clash with Crystal Palace suggests the 21-year-old could soon be out in the cold.",
      "Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing as Manchester United boss when he joined in a £25m move from Lecce in January. He struggled along with the rest of his teammates in his debut half-season and there are no real signs of improvement in the left wing-back this term, with recent performances leading him to be picked out as a weak link in the United side.",
      "In a withering assessment of his contributions ahead of the Palace game, Amorim said: “You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he’s making in our team. I think it’s the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "“I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve. I just need to understand the context in trying to help them (Dorgu and Dalot). They are far from their best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I just look at them, and think they have so much more to give. So let’s see this week if we can improve that.”",
      "Dalot, who’s also been far from his (mediocre) best takes Dorgu’s place on the left, with Amad Diallo dropping deeper in place of Noussair Mazraoui at right wing-back and Mason Mount coming into the starting lineup to occupy one of the inverted No.10 spots.",
      "Dorgu’s snub comes on the back of him failing to realise the media attention paid to social media posts slating the Manchester United manager, and more specifically the players’ responses to said posts.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Man Utd: Mainoo ‘says yes’ to transfer as Romano confirms ‘deal sealed’ for first 2026 signing\n👉 Man Utd ‘present offer’ to hijack Liverpool transfer with one club ‘leading race’ for one reason\n👉 Rashford to Barcelona roadblock prompts Arsenal interest; sees PSG ‘test’ Man Utd with £61m swap offer",
      "An Instagram post pointing out the flaws in Amorim’s management of the club which stated ‘Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together’ received a ‘like’ from Dorgu, or at least Dorgu’s profile this week.",
      "And while Amorim is yet to respond to his wing-back’s misguided social media actions, and frankly if he’s asked about it in a press conference or interview quite a large part of us will die inside, the pre-game comments he did make on Dorgu suggest United will look to bring in someone to play ahead of him as a priority.",

      "Third, how the hell can the board sack a man who won the league last season? I don’t care about Klopp’s team blah blah blah – He took that team to the top of the league and on an excellent run in the Champions league – not to mention Carabao cup Finalists.",

      "",
      "This week we saw an impressive team display by a team from Merseyside where they showed a clear collective desire to fight for the good of the team, working tirelessly in that regard whilst having a clear incisive plan about how to attack the opposition – it’s just a shame to me that the team in question wore blue ( .. a genuine congratulations to the toffees for a performance that they can be rightly proud of against Man Utd).",
      "Which leads me to the crux of this mail – where is the collective fight to overcome adversity within this Liverpool team that we are watching this season?",
      "I have always felt across my many decades of supporting Liverpool that the collective spirit/battling qualities are part of our DNA and therefore a given. Recent viewings appear to be bringing this into question.",
      "That is not to say that if we solve that particular aspect that everything else will just fall into place – it feels to me that there are many layers to our current malaise (layers may be the wrong term here … perhaps a tangled ball of wool is more apt).",
      "Let me briefly comment on one or two (but not all !) of those key aspects as I see it:",
      "From a squad balance perspective there appears to have been a questionable prioritisation of transfer funds across the summer that has led to a situation where we are too thin in defensive areas. I can’t complain about the purchase of Wirtz as he looks to be an incredibly gifted footballer, but one who is struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the premier league as things stand (still feel he’ll likely come good though). What would also help is him having a clearer role in the team in terms of where he plays – I am not saying we have to build the team around him, but it does feel like the opposite has happened with Slot’s decisions to shunt him around to different positions.",
      "You won’t get many Liverpool fans complaining about Ekitike, but the manner in which the Isak saga played out after his signing just feels that we got suckered into a ‘whose got the biggest d*ck’ contest with Newcastle and ended up spending top dollar for an ingredient that we may not have explicitly needed – as others have pointed out, there appears to have been no winners as things stand from that soap opera of a signing.",
      "So that’s £125m that could perhaps have been repointed to other key areas, namely defensive spine, and I include the No6 position in that.",
      "We have a scenario at the moment where our CB’s are not performing individually / collectively to the standards previously set, yet there appears to be no consequence to them for that – they effectively know that they are going to be starting the next game. Quite what Gomez has to do to get a start in the prem is beyond me – Slot says he is not match fit / sharp, yet fails to enlighten us as to how he can solve that whilst giving him no game time.",
      "I very much hope that Marc Guehi ends up being a Liverpool player, the sooner the better.",
      "Liverpool’s midfield have been off it this year – lacking aggression and togetherness – and providing a weakened shield to a more troubled defence (= goals against).",
      "I have said it in previous mails that I would like Liverpool to get a decent No6 to improve our options and add a bit of needed steel (Ederson from Atalanta would be an ideal).",
      "… but the summer money was spent elsewhere.",
      "Lastly, thoughts about how the team is being led currently.",
      "I’ve previously said that Slot has tried to integrate too many different new ingredients into the team stew whilst expecting the overall outcome to taste the same – previous experience both inside and outside the club should have told him that was perhaps a little naïve.",
      "He appears to be quite stubborn in some of his continued selections of certain new players who appear to be struggling form wise (eg. Kerkez), when I feel an alternative blanket approach should have been adopted, namely that each new player should have come to the club on the broad understanding that they had to earn their place in the team. Robertson should have played ahead of Kerkez until form dictated otherwise. Bradley (when fit !) should start at RB.",
      "The one new player who answered that form call in spades is Ekitike, and he finds himself marginalised in favour of a more expensive and currently less effective alternative (sigh).",

      "I want to reply to this comment from Micky P, ‘I don’t think the Jota situation has ever been seen anywhere in elite sport – a player in his prime dying suddenly.’ I would refer him to the 2020 season when Kobe Bryant died. While not all of the players and staff at the Lakers had played with Kobe and he wasn’t in his prime I’m sure the shadow of his loss stretched over the season. How did they respond? They won the championship. IF Liverpool were flying right now I am sure that would be the narrative. The ‘this means more’ drum would be beaten, the team would be speaking about it in the press. Instead it appears poor squad building as much as anything has disrupted their season. I’m not discounting the impact of grief. I am sure it plays a part in the situation but to write of the season seems a bit much for the ‘mentality monsters’ of LFC.\nHanKolo, Vietnam",

      "Mikey P, Cardiff brings up good points about the impact of Diogo Jota’s death on the Liverpool team, and while he felt there weren’t any other case histories in elite sport where the untimely death of a beloved teammate has had a profound effect on performance of the team, I can share two from American major league baseball history.",
      "So the Pittsburgh Pirates were a dominate team in the early 70s. They won their NL division three years consecutively with records of 89-73 (1970), 97-65 (1971) and 96-59 (1972), and won the 1971 World Series (I know…it’s called what it’s called).",
      "Then on Dec 31, 1972, Roberto Clemente, a true talisman for the Pirates who had been at the club for 18 years, died in a plane crash while on mercy mission to deliver aid and food to Nicaragua after a massive earthquake. He chartered the airplane himself and packed it with emergency supplies. I’ll let the good people at Wikipedia fill you in:",
      "“Clemente visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.",
      "The airplane which he chartered for the New Year’s Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds (1,900 kg). It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Clemente was baseball GOAT conversation material from an on-field performance perspective and a saint of a humanitarian.",
      "What happened to the Pirates? Well the club and his adopted city of Pittsburgh were devastated. Many of Clemente’s teammates traveled to Puerto Rico to be with his family and his buddy Manny Sanguillén even personally went to the crash site and literally dove in the water to participate in recovery efforts.",
      "And the aftermath: the Pirates tanked in 1973, going 80-82 and finishing 3rd in the NL East after winning the division 3 years in a row. In 1974 they returned to winning ways topping their division in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and capped off a productive decade by winning the World Series in 1979.",
      "There is another baseball player, the New York Yankee’s Thurmon Munson, who also died in an airplane crash in August of 1979 – won’t share the whole story – but the Yankees had won their AL division and consecutive World Series in 1977 & 1978, but finished 1979 in 4th place in their division, way out of contention.",
      "MLB baseball teams play 162 game seasons, so that’s a lot of datapoints to establish trends of causative and correlative relationships.",
      "It’s no revelation that personal grief impacts humans in profound ways, but the sudden loss of a beloved teammate and “brother in arms” has happened before in elite sport and while it’s difficult to calculate/quantify the effect from a human perspective, you can see it on the pitch/baseball diamond, and it’s real.",
      "There are fans in Pittsburgh and New York still alive and old enough to remember the trauma of losing Clemente and Munson…and they probably would assume YNWA is a rap band, but YNWA is felt in spirit by the many who love their sports teams and have been through a grieving process similar to yours.

I get that the name of the game is to score goals, but a team with over 70% possession and a 21 shot edge on their opponents is not being outplayed, let alone dominated. They are missing their shots.

I would slightly disagree with Ian Wright that it is solely racially motivated when black players are criticised. I think the UK press has, on the whole, an issue with people, black/white/ whatever, that they perceive as above their station, too big for their boots, especially where they think that station feels like it has not been fully earned (same papers will have no problem with the royals mind). It is something inherent in the British press’s mindset to tear those people down in my opinion and it is beyond racially motivated.\nGarret (LFC Doldrums), Ireland",

      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100million for Elliot Anderson after Manchester City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Anderson has been one of the best midfielders in the Premier League this season, leading the division in ball recoveries (98).",
      "He is also third for fouls won (25), fifth for passes completed (734), and third for progressive passes (100).",
      "Anderson’s form has been a rare bright spot in a difficult season for Forest.",
      "The City Ground club are already on their third manager of the campaign after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo with Ange Postecoglou, who only lasted eight games before being replaced by Sean Dyche.",
      "While Forest, who are 16th in the Premier League, have struggled, Anderson has been fantastic under all three managers.",
      "Unsurprisingly, his form has caught the attention of several top clubs.",
      "One of those clubs is Manchester City, who are seeking a long-term replacement for Rodri.",
      "Rodri has struggled to stay fit this season after missing the majority of 2024/25 with an ACL injury, and his deputy Nico Gonzalez has failed to impress so far.",
      "Gonzalez is definitely improving, and any midfielder is a downgrade on the 2024 Ballon d’Or winner, but Pep Guardiola will have expected more from the £50million January signing.",
      "Anderson is Premier League-proven and looks the real deal. Not only has he been terrific for Forest, but he has also established himself as a regular in Thomas Tuchel’s England starting XI.",
      "He’d be a top signing for City, and according to the Daily Mail, Guardiola’s side are ‘ready to make Anderson one of their top targets in 2026’ and are now ‘ahead of’ Manchester United in the race for his signature.",
      "City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, and Guardiola are huge admirers of the 23-year-old and have sent scouts to watch him this season.",
      "It’s believed Forest ‘will reject any advances in January’ and think they can hold out for £100m after the World Cup. The minimum expectation is £80m for Anderson, who appeals to City because he can play as both a No.6 and No.8.",
      "Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has also been targeted by City, but they are now more interested in the Forest star.",
      "There is also interest from Liverpool and Manchester United, while £80-100m is deemed too much by his former club Newcastle United.",

      "Anderson’s pathway into the starting XI was blocked by Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton, while Eddie Howe also had Lewis Miley and Joe Willock at his disposal.",
      "The midfielder wasn’t pushing to leave but wanted regular football. When the opportunity to join Forest arose, he took it, and the Magpies were happy to oblige.",
      "His exit was regarded as nothing more than a PSR sham, with Greek goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos moving in the opposite direction in a separate deal worth ‘£20m’.",
      "Anderson’s transfer fee on paper was £35m, but it was effectively a £15m move when you accounted for the Odysseas deal.",
      "At the time, £35m looked laughable. Now he’s worth around triple that.",
      "Not only would Anderson be perfect for this disjointed Newcastle team, with Joelinton declining, Miley showing little progression, and Ramsey and Willock injury-prone, but they will be devastated to have let a £100m midfielder, who came through their academy, leave for £15m.",
      "They absolutely f***ed it. But nobody thought they had at the time. And Newcastle’s hands were tied by the Premier League’s financial rules; they felt they had little choice but to cash in for pure profit.",

      "Monday 1 December 2025 21:14, UK",
      "Fulham vs Man City - Tuesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "When Erling Haaland hit his 99th Premier League goal in Manchester City's 3-0 win over Liverpool on November 9, it seemed only a matter of time before he would join the '100 Club', where only 34 players in the competition's history have scored a century or more.",
      "But despite playing the entirety of the games against Newcastle and Leeds that followed, that milestone goal has so far eluded him. This two-game barren spell is rare - but looks likely to end on Tuesday night if history is anything to go by.",
      "The Norwegian has scored six goals in six Premier League appearances against Fulham, the most of any player since the Cottagers returned to the top flight in 2022/23. The last was a penalty on the final day of 2024/25.",
      "Standing in the way is a Fulham team that has thrived on home soil so far, though. Last term, they picked up 26 points at Craven Cottage, averaging 1.36 points per game. They already have 13 this season, which equates to a hugely improved average of 2.17.",
      "Only Arsenal (2) have conceded less than the three they have shipped at home so far.",
      "Fulham's fortress will either deny Haaland history again, or be the stage on which he finally writes it.Dan Long",
      "Bournemouth vs Everton - Tuesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "The Premier League comes at you fast - and no one knows that better than Bournemouth.",
      "At the end of October, Andoni Iraola's side were sitting pretty in fifth place in the Premier League, unbeaten in seven, with their only loss coming to champions Liverpool on the opening day of the season. But, in just a month, their fortunes have completely changed.",
      "November was - to put it politely - dismal. The Cherries picked up one point out of a possible 12 - a point salvaged from two down at home to strugglers West Ham - and conceded a whopping 12 goals in their four outings to boot.",
      "Their sudden loss of form has seen them drop to 11th in the table, only two points ahead of Fulham in 15th. To keep up early-season hopes of European football, something needs to change - and fast.",
      "The south coast side face perhaps the perfect opponents in Everton. They are still unbeaten at home and have more Premier League wins, goals and points against the Toffees than any other side in their history.",
      "The visitors' striker, Thierno Barry, is not exactly in the kind of form that strikes fear into defenders' hearts. The Frenchman has yet to register a shot on target in 551 league minutes and looked limp in his side's 4-1 home drubbing to Newcastle on Saturday.",
      "Bournemouth might have an easier night's sleep ahead of Tuesday's game. It's exactly the sort of fixture they need to revive their form; but a first loss at the Vitality will see serious questions start to be asked heading into the busiest period of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Newcastle vs Spurs - Tuesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "It's toxic at Tottenham - and not for the first time.",
      "Go back to the 2021/22 season and Spurs had beaten Manchester City, but early momentum was quashed by damning home defeats to Chelsea and Arsenal. In a game against Manchester Utd, a Spurs substitution was booed by their own fans, who were not impressed with their new head coach's style of play.",
      "Sound familiar?",
      "Thomas Frank's start to life at Spurs bares a very similar resemblance to Nuno Espirito Santo's short, ill-fated reign in north London. And given Nuno was sacked after 10 games, with the supporters' trust saying he was \"not the right manager\" for the club, it's not a good sign for the Dane.",
      "With the shadow of the trophy-winning Ange Postecoglou still looming over Spurs' situation, there is deep unrest.",
      "There are issues involving the players - with Guglielmo Vicario and Pedro Porro's supporter drama in Saturday's loss to Fulham following the Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence spat of frustration after the loss to Chelsea. But will Frank become the one mainly in the fire soon?",
      "Spurs are in the bottom three in the Premier League this season for shots and chances created, while only one Premeir League team has given the ball away more times. They have also made a league-high 12 errors leading to a shot.",
      "Frank will point to the fact he is at the start of a rebuilding project - and his desire to \"add layers\" to this team. But with Spurs going to Newcastle - a team they've already lost to this season in the Carbaao Cup - how much are their restless fans willing to take?Sam Blitz",
      "Arsenal vs Brentford - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Arsenal were not themselves at Chelsea. They were off the pace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Several misplaced passes in the build-up phase and they lost the duel battle to Chelsea. They lost two-thirds of their first 24 duels in the opening quarter of the game, while they only won one of the first 10 aerial duels.",
      "There were several factors behind it. Chelsea played well - having had an extra day to prepare after their midweek European action - while the absences of William Saliba and Gabriel filtered throughout the team to create an unconvincing display.",
      "It has also been a busy schedule. \"It's been a big week,\" said Mikel Arteta after overcoming the triple header of Spurs, Bayern Munich and the Blues last week. So is it time for the Arsenal manager to rotate?",
      "Wednesday night's visit of Brentford may be a good opportunity to give minutes to those who need it, but more crucially rest those who have been called upon a lot.",
      "For example, Ben White could come in for Jurrien Timber. The likes of Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres are aiming for first starts after injury. Even Christian Norgaard, against his former club, and Ethan Nwaneri could be called upon.",
      "Brentford's record against the bigger sides makes them a decent test so there cannot be wholesale changes. But one thing the Bees are good at is winning duels via first and second balls. Arsenal will need fresh legs more than on-pitch quality.Sam Blitz",
      "Liverpool vs Sunderland - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "It cannot just be a coincidence that Liverpool kept their first Premier League clean sheet since they beat Aston Villa a month ago - and only their third all season in the top flight - in their much-needed win at West Ham United on Sunday in a game that also saw Joe Gomez make his first league start in almost a year, incidentally also in a victory at the London Stadium.",
      "Despite a series of calamitous recent defensive displays, including a 3-0 loss to struggling Nottingham Forest, followed by a 4-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven - both at Anfield - in the lead-up to the game, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot had been stubbornly resisting calls to start Gomez, who has been carrying a slight knee niggle of late.",
      "But the versatile 28-year-old returned on the right-hand side of the champions' defence in east London, with the Reds immediately looking more assured at the back, with no visiting player making more interceptions, while he also created their second goal for Coady Gakpo.",
      "Fitness permitting, expect Liverpool's long-serving player to still be in the hosts' starting line-up when high-flying Sunderland visit Anfield.",
      "Richard Morgan",
      "Burnley vs Crystal Palace - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Only two Premier League teams have missed more than 25 big chances this season - Crystal Palace are one of them.",
      "With 26, Palace have a major problem with converting the big opportunities they are managing to create.",
      "Oliver Glasner bemoaned his side's lack of business, calling for some level of sympathy as his side tired in their defeat to Manchester United. However, in their ascendancy, Palace failed to capitalise on a rampant first half, which could be costing them more than their squad depth.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta, who took his tally of big chances missed up to 12 against United, is only behind Erling Haaland for big chances spurned.",
      "Creativity was the main concern for Palace when Eberechi Eze moved on to pastures new in the summer. However, creating isn't what's holding Palace back; it's their inability to score.",
      "Burnley will provide the sternest test of Palace's ability to find the back of the net. Scott Parker's Clarets have the league's highest expected goals against with 28.79, meaning - on paper - there will be ample opportunity to exorcise their big-chance demons.William Bitibiri",
      "Wolves vs Nottingham Forest - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Wolves are in trouble. As we enter the final month of the year, they remain winless. It's a dismal start that has seen their foreheads pressed against the barrel of a relegation to the Championship.",
      "Defeat at Forest would mean that they have lost seven straight matches in the top flight.",
      "The last time the club fell to that many defeats was during the 2011/12 season, during Terry Connor's infamous reign, which was an all-time low in a relegation season.",
      "The records are likely to compound if fortunes fail to turn at Molineux. Wolves are on target to lose 32 matches this season.",
      "Derby County in 2007/08, statistically the Premier League's worst team, had six points recorded by this point while Wolves have two. They are on track to take Derby's crown.",
      "Only once has a team recorded lass than two points at this stage in Premier League history and that was Sheffield Wednesday, who had one and were ultimately relegated. While the chances of a Wolves survival remain slim, fans will hope to retain some semblance of respectability starting with Forest on Wednesday.William Bitibiri",
      "Leeds vs Chelsea - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "This is a fixture packed with history - and plenty of thumping tackles and intensity. The 1970 FA Cup final replay was the most fearsome of all but expect another boiling hot atmosphere at Elland Road when the sides meet again on Wednesday.",
      "Can Enzo Maresca's side keep their heads in the pressure cooker?",
      "The midfielder will be suspended for the Leeds trip but ill-discipline is becoming a theme for this Chelsea team. There have been six red cards shown to Chelsea players this season. Their four in the Premier League is twice as many as any other side.",
      "Even Maresca has served a suspension after being sent to the stands for his jubilant celebrations of Estevao's last-gasp winner against Liverpool.",
      "It's a concern which really came into focus at the back end of last season, when Nicolas Jackson saw red at Newcastle, Chelsea were beaten, and the race for a Champions League place was went right down to the wire.",
      "Against Arsenal, Chelsea battled valiantly with 10 players. A point gained? Or was it two dropped, given how they had started the derby with 11?",
      "There's a lot to like about the team Maresca has built at Chelsea - but they can be their own worst enemy and must keep the focus to maintain their positive start to the season at Leeds.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton vs Aston Villa - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Brighton's unbeaten home record faces its toughest test yet with the visit of in-form Aston Villa.",
      "Both sides started the campaign slowly, earning just one win between them from their opening five games, but now they're firmly in the race for European football.",
      "Villa recorded their fifth clean sheet of the season on Sunday and have the second-best defensive record in the division, although at the other end of the pitch, they're not having so much joy.",
      "They're second bottom for xG while Ollie Watkins has scored just once and was dropped for the victory at Wolves, with Donyell Malen preferred. The quick turnaround may see Watkins reintroduced from the start.",
      "There's been no such issues for Brighton striker Danny Welbeck, who has only been getting better at 35. His seven goals, combined with the efforts of Yankuba Minteh, have powered Fabian Hurzeler's side up the table.",
      "The winger has the second-most assists and touches in the opposition box in the league, with only Jeremy Doku and Mohammed Kudus having completed more dribbles. Villa's defence will have to be at its best.David Richardson",
      "Man Utd vs West Ham - Thursday, kick-off 8pm",
      "Manchester United may have picked up a crucial away win at Selhurst Park on Sunday, but Old Trafford will be expecting far more come Thursday night.",
      "The embarrassment that was the defeat to 10-man Everton will still be at the forefront of the minds of the fans and Ruben Amorim.",
      "The performance and the way Everton kept out a limp Red Devils provides Nuno Espirito Santo with the blueprint for how to get a result. That means there has to be a marked change from the hosts, perhaps even in personnel.",
      "United are expected to dominate the ball against the team who have had less possession in all but two of their away Premier League games this term. The anomalies being against promoted sides.",
      "Amorim will need players on the pitch who can break down the Hammers. That may present an opportunity to Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The 20-year-old has only been afforded 171 minutes in the Premier League this season. It is a far cry from the role he had at the time of scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "However, United have consistently struggled with breaking down low blocks and Amorim won't change his system.",
      "If his stubbornness on the front is going to persist, the dice needs to be rolled one way or another.",
      "There is a question as to whether the defensive presence of Casemiro is as vital for this game compared to against the likes of Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle later this month.",
      "Keeping the Brazilian fresh for those must be a priority, so the door may open for Mainoo to make his first league start of the season and show once and for all he is deserving of more from Amorim heading into 2026.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 18:27, UK",
      "Mason Mount saved Manchester United from a further inquest when he fired home in a  2-1 comeback victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "The midfielder rifled in from a well-worked set-piece after being teed up by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "That goal, Mount's second of the season, came minutes after Joshua Zirkzee ended a year-long wait for a Premier League goal with a finish from what looked like an impossible angle.",
      "With a combined xG of 0.05, United completed a second-half turnaround in a game that, before the halftime whistle, offered very little hope for Ruben Amorim's side. The Portuguese boss was critical of their display in the early exchanges in his post-match, saying his side \"cannot play like that in the Premier League\".",
      "Crystal Palace:  Henderson (4), Munoz (5), Richards (6), Lacroix (6), Guehi (6), Mitchell (5), Wharton (6), Kamada (6), Pino (6), Sarr (5), Mateta (7)\n\n\nSubs:  Lerma (5), Nketiah (4), Uche (6), Hughes (6), Devenny (6).\n\n\n Man Utd:  Lammens (5), Dalot (5), Yoro (3), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Amad (6), Casemiro (5), Bruno Fernandes (7), Mbeumo (6), Mount (8), Zirkzee (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Mazraoui (6), Martinez (n/a), Dorgu (n/a), Mainoo (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mason Mount",
      "United were outclassed and outfought by Palace in the opening 45 minutes despite showing early promise when Dean Henderson denied Casemiro an early goal with a smart stop. Amorim watched on as his side generated just 0.01 expected goals without set-pieces.",
      "In a run of play that summed up United's sorry showing, Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta in the area to give away a sure penalty.",
      "Having initially sent Senne Lammens the wrong way, Mateta had to do the same again after being adjudged to have touched the ball twice by VAR.",
      "More chances followed for Palace in the first half with Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw called upon to make huge interventions to prevent further damage.",
      "Amorim could be seen anxiously pacing in the mixed zone during the half-time break, taking a moment before what would have been his most significant talk to his players, hoping to avoid a repeat of Monday's hopeless showing against the 10 men of Everton.",
      "Whatever he said worked, helping United end a run of three without a win to move up to sixth, above Palace who are denied a place in the top four. Amorim also becomes the first United boss to win at Selhurst Park since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020.",
      "Manchester United must figure out a way to overcome their Jekyll and Hyde complex. Ruben Amorim's side were nowhere near it in the first half at Crystal Palace.",
      "They lacked energy, belief and any ideas as they were under the pump at Selhurt Park. But then a moment of magic from Joshua Zirkzee changed it all.",
      "Across the season, United's starts have been fairly positive and where United have typically found their joy.",
      "However, they have failed to sustain their early displays. In recent performances, United have been far more effective in the second half; their problem, though, is their slow starts.",
      "The defensive numbers are where the difference is stark. Across United's first 11 games this season, in the first half, they had an expected goals against of 5.71. This changed in the second half where that number nearly doubled to 11.07.",
      "However, in their last two games, at Palace and in defeat to Everton, United have a first-half expected goals against of 1.26, while after the break, this number massively decreases to 0.26.",
      "It's important to note that in both games United fell behind in the first half, therefore were naturally more attack-minded in the second period.",
      "However, there's a clue in the numbers that Amorim's team are a different side when they go ahead early, like they did eight times in their first 11 league games, compared to when they concede early on.",
      "Perhaps there are signs of complacency in their leads that Amorim has to fix while also finding a way to motivate faster starts.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"It [Joshua Zirkzee's goal] was really important.",
      "\"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half, he struggled in the duels, and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"And we improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. And that is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We played better because Josh played better in the second half.",
      "\"I just said to the players [at half time] we need to be more alive, and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often and I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers a goal right away, you feel that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt his side would come back, Amorim said:",
      "\"I felt that because I had the feeling, if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box.",
      "\"And you can feel it, the way they move, that they were getting tired for the second half.",
      "\"We talked about that and again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling, we had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.\"",
      "\"Ismaila Sarr has been, by far and away, one of Crystal Palace's standout players since he arrived at the club from Marseille in August 2024. The numbers speak for themselves: 66 appearances, 20 goals, 10 assists.",
      "\"But he may well have played his last game of the year for Oliver Glasner's side.",
      "\"The Senegal forward went down under a challenge from Luke Shaw inside the first four minutes at Selhurst Park and made a motion with his hand as if to suggest he had twisted his ankle. He lasted just over half an hour more, before being replaced by Eddie Nketiah.",
      "\"Asked about Sarr's condition in his post-match press conference, Glasner said: \"The ankle is quite swollen, so I think he will miss a few games, maybe the whole time until he goes to AFCON.\"",
      "\"Senegal start their AFCON campaign on December 23, when they face Botswana in Tangier, Morocco. If Pape Thiaw's side make it as far as the final, Sarr would not return to domestic action until late January or early February.",
      "\"Glasner has already made it clear Palace must strengthen in January, with an attacker at the top of his shopping list - and now it appears to be even more imperative than before.\"",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner:",
      "\"What disappointed me? Almost everything.",
      "\"Conceding two goals from set-plays, three of the last four goals being conceded from set-plays. That makes it really frustrating, because I think we played a very good first half, and deserved to have the lead.",
      "\"I can't remember a big chance from open play in the whole game.",
      "\"We are not fresh enough in many games and the energy level dropped, but I think we made it just harder for us because we conceded these two goals.",
      "\"In the situation we are in now, it looked like it was tough, but I think, at the end, we tried everything.",
      "\"We had a few set-plays as well, an even better situation, the free-kick. But we missed it, they took it, and so that's why we lost it.\"",

      "At Nottingham Forest on November 1, Man Utd conceded twice in two minutes at the start of the second half. They went on to draw 2-2, the same result they had against Tottenham the following week.",
      "Against Everton on Monday Night Football, David Moyes' side - who played with 10 players for most of the game - scored with their only shot on target to beat Man Utd 1-0.",
      "This season, Amorim's side have scored and conceded the same amount of goals - 19 each - and the head coach has criticised his team's defensive play.",
      "Speaking ahead of Sunday's Premier League game against Crystal Palace, he said: \"We have some results of not letting a lot of teams in the final third, but we are being really soft near the box so we need to improve that.",
      "\"Especially against Forest - we took a lot of crosses, we didn't press well in that moment. Against Everton, they had 10 men, we cannot suffer a goal but we suffered a goal with the only shot on target.",
      "\"We are there near the box, we have more players than Everton, we should be better. More strong on the duels and Crystal Palace are very strong on duels and when they have to defend, they are really strong.",
      "\"Those things can change how you see teams, but we need to improve in a lot of things. We need to close our goals because we are scoring goals. It's an issue, it's not about the defenders, but about the team and the way we feel our danger near the box.",
      "\"It's not just the numbers. It's Nottingham Forest, to suffer two goals in two minutes after half-time, that's a concern.",
      "\"You are controlling the game against Tottenham and you have the same amount of guys when they score. We are in a good position, but we need to be better and more aggressive. That is my biggest concern.",
      "\"It's the way you see the game and understand that if you're better in this moment, you should have more points and the narrative will be different.\"",
      "After a run of three successive Premier League wins, Man Utd have not won a league game in November, and will be hoping to put this right at Selhurst Park this weekend.",
      "Amorim also pointed out that the pressure to win at Man Utd is more intense than at any other club, and it will take time to find consistency with wins - something not afforded to many.",
      "He added: \"I think it's clear it will take time especially in the Premier League when every club is prepared for everything. They are improving a lot.",

      "Ruben Amorim dismisses direct comparisons between his Man Utd and Crystal Palace ahead of Sunday's trip to Selhurst Park because, he says, 'we play in a different way' despite shaping up in same 3-4-2-1 formation but he admits Oliver Glasner's side 'are doing things better than us'",
      "Friday 28 November 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",
      "The United boss came under fire for refusing to adapt in Monday's dismal defeat to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, bringing his 3-4-2-1 formation back into the spotlight ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who have enjoyed success playing in the same shape.",
      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",
      "Asked if wing-back is an area he wants to strengthen, Amorim said: \"We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I've said that over the last year.",
      "\"To give an example, in the last game [against Everton], we should have an Amad with the right foot to put on the other side to play against 10 men.",
      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",
      "\"We play in a different way. You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Palace possess a top wing-back in Daniel Munoz, and the Colombia international has previously spoken of his desire to play for Manchester United.",
      "Speaking earlier this month to AS, he said: \"I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another. For me, it would be a dream to play for one of those clubs, whether it's Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that; every day I give it my all so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of these clubs.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. I'm not really aware of what's being said; I don't have any information about whether these teams want me or are interested in me.",
      "\"We'll see when the winter transfer window approaches.\"",
      "Glasner defended Amorim's system ahead of the game and said he had seen an improvement in United this season.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front. Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Amorim admits he would have preferred to bring on a more attacking alternative to Dalot at Everton with no other options available on his bench, but stuck with the same shape nonetheless.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 09:19, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "\"I see the ideal Manchester United midfielder as being able to do everything.\"",
      "The words of former Old Trafford metronome, Paul Scholes.",
      "United's midfield remains a problem. Ruben Amorim's system continues to be drawn into question, a set-up with its frailties further scrutinised as a result of an insistence on leaving two players anchoring in the middle of the park.",
      "Whether it be personnel or instruction, United's inability to consistently control games continues to cost them.",
      "In a test of Amorim's system against 10-man Everton on Monday night, United had very few answers. Instead, Amorim's rare unbeaten run of five matches fell to a dismal end as United were outplayed, outfought and outthought.",
      "With 718 appearances for United, 155 goals and a trophy haul to rival most English football clubs, very few have taken to the Old Trafford midfield like Scholes once did.",
      "As he sat in central London, given an opportunity to mull over the past ahead of a live event for his podcast, The Good the Bad and The Football, being asked \"What makes a Manchester United midfielder?\", the proverbial gears began to turn.",
      "\"It's a little bit different when I played because you hear these number 6s, number 8s, number 10s, I suppose, come into that midfield role as well,\" Scholes says.",
      "\"You can attack, you can defend, you can be part of everything. That's your job as a midfield player for Manchester United.\"",
      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",
      "Kobbie Mainoo emerged as a key player for Erik ten Hag when he made his debut in 2023. That 'Everton debut' that fans reminisce about didn't see him deployed as a No 10, nor as a No 8. Instead, an 18-year-old Mainoo was United's deepest midfielder when he impressed.",
      "An England debut followed in the summer, where at the 2024 European Championship, England's performances improved when Mainoo started alongside Rice as a No 8 as the competition drew on.",
      "Mainoo started the Euro final for England but just two camps later, found himself hurled into the shadows as Rice's partner gained new suitors. Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",
      "\"I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",
      "One thing is for certain, though, United will continue the season, waiting for the midfielder that \"can do everything\".",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
