      "Gordon Strachan reckons Andre Onana has made his last appearance for Manchester United.",
      "Onana joined Trabzonspor on-loan in September, having fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford. The Cameroon international made just one United appearance, before leaving. United boss Ruben Amorim now regards Sanne Lammens as his long-term No.1 goalkeeper. And former United favourite Strachan believes there is no way back for Onana, even when his loan deal expires.",
      "Strachan told Esports News : \"I think Andre Onana has played his last game for Manchester United.",
      "\"At United you must have a presence in goal - whether it’s physical, attitude, or character, you have to be a presence. I don’t think he had that when he played for the club.",
      "\"A big problem for me is that I'm not sure Onana really wanted to be at Old Trafford. He looked like he’d rather be somewhere else and that might be what he needs to start enjoying his football again.",
      "\"At no point did I think he was enjoying playing football for United. I'd be shocked if I saw him play again for the club. I think his United career is over in that respect.\"",
      "Strachan, meanwhile, admits he is still not convinced about United's decision to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a £73m deal. Sesko has scored just twice in 12 appearances this season and Strachan added: \"Benjamin Sesko has looked tentative, to say the very least.",
      "\"He’s still a young player, but I’m not sure about him at the moment. You have to give young players more time, but I haven’t seen anything from him so far since he joined that has shown much promise.",
      "\"The other attacking signings, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, have looked much better - Mbeumo in particular. He’s made the difference on a few occasions for United already and he has an honesty about his game that I really like.",
      "\"He has really stepped up in the last few games against Liverpool, Brighton and Spurs. He could be very important for United this season.",
      "\"Sesko, on the other hand, needs to show more glimpses and moments like Cunha and Mbeumo have done. It’s still early days, but he needs to be having more of an effect on games.\"",

      "Manchester United are said to have lodged an offer for Barcelona star Marc-Andre ter Stegen with the German tipped for a January loan move. The goalkeeper has endured a difficult season in Catalonia.",
      "He was shunted down the pecking order by summer signing Joan Garcia following his arrival from Espanyol. That then led to Ter Stegen undergoing surgery for a long-term back issue and he has been sidelined ever since.",
      "A loan move away from Barcelona has been touted for the 33-year-old as he attempts to build his fitness ahead of next summer’s World Cup. And it appears that Man United could offer him a solution.",
      "It was reported in Spain last month that Red Devils chiefs had made contact over signing Ter Stegen, while El Desmarque have further revealed that the German has received ‘several offers’, including from United and Turkish side Besiktas.",
      "It is suggested that all clubs interested are keeping a close eye on his recovery ahead of any potential swoop. Ter Stegen was signed from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2014 and he has gone on to make 422 Barcelona appearances, winning six league titles, six Spanish cups and the Champions League.",
      "“I know I’ll be at Barcelona next year,” the German international said about his future in the summer. “No one has spoken to me about this, and it’s always difficult to comment on everything. I know I’ll be at Barcelona next year.”",
      "Meanwhile, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has recently revealed that a breakdown in communication was to blame for Ter Stegen’s current situation. Speaking to Sport Bild, he said: ”Has it all always gone so well in terms of communication?",
      "“I think there is a lot to improve, also from my side. He is a top goalkeeper and he gets support from all of us.”",
      "“You have a very young, talented goalkeeper in Joan García, who is at a very good level, and we all decided together that this should be the future of Barcelona. So it was clear what our approach was,” he added.",
      "“It’s important to me that Marc and the club have come closer and have really sought communication. For me, it’s important that Marc comes back now. He’s a top goalkeeper and he’s getting all the support from us so that he can play at his level again.”",
      "Any move from United would be intriguing given how impressive Senne Lammens has been at Old Trafford since his summer switch from Royal Antwerp.",

      "Alan Shearer has urged Liverpool to think twice before going after Antoine Semenyo, who has a release clause in his Bournemouth contract which will become active in January.",
      "The Ghanaian winger chose to remain with the Cherries in the summer whilst a number of their top stars headed for pastures new. Semenyo has gone on to become a leading light for Bournemouth this term and has come up with six goals and three assists in his first 11 appearances, fuelling further interest in his services.",
      "Two of those goals came on the opening night of the campaign at Liverpool as Bournemouth levelled the contest for a period. Semenyo ran the length of the pitch before firing past Alisson for one of his goals.",
      "There is talk of him taking on a new challenge come the New Year with Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham among those keen. But Shearer insists those eyeing Semenyo's signature must consider the environment he will be coming into, claiming he's been at a \"tiny\" club in comparison.",
      "Liverpool have seen such dangers first hand with Shearer referencing the struggles experienced by Milos Kerkez, who was a hugely impressive performer for Bournemouth last term. He moved to Anfield for £40million but has been in and out of the starting XI such have been his struggles.",
      "The Premier League great told Betfair: \"Antoine Semenyo has been linked with a move to Anfield, now, I don't know what Liverpool's plans will be for next season but there'll be a huge list of Premier League clubs that have already enquired about him and would love him in the team because of the ability that he has.",
      "\"As we've seen with Kerkez, it's alright playing well at Bournemouth where it's a great football club, but in terms of size it's tiny compared to someone like Liverpool. I guess you can say that with most players. These clubs invest a lot of money into players, so they'll know everything they need to about the player already.\"",
      "Liverpool invested heavily in their frontline over the summer, bringing in Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. They've failed to click however and with Mohamed Salah experiencing a sharp dip in form there is talk of life beyond the Egyptian.",
      "The Bournemouth ace claimed recently that he's attempting to keep the noise about his future at bay. He said: \"I don't think about it too much. I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused.\"",
      "Bristol City, who sold Semenyo to the Cherries for around £10m in January 2023, would be due 20 percent of any profit made on the winger.",

      "Manchester United star Radek Vitek has revealed his desire to become the club’s number one goalkeeper - but is not ready to return to Old Trafford quite yet. The Czech stopper joined the Red Devils from Sigma Olomouc back in 2020 and he has since earned experience in loan spells with Accrington Stanley and Blau-Weiss Linz.",
      "Vitek, 22, was then given the chance to join Championship side Bristol City on loan for the season this summer. The young goalkeeper has impressed since joining the Robins, keeping five clean sheets in 15 appearances.",
      "United slotted a recall clause into the deal - but Vitek has already stressed that he does NOT want that to be activated in the New Year.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol, he said: \"At the moment the main goal is probably to stay here the whole season and play as many matches as possible.",
      "\"Every game brings different challenges and that's how you get as a young keeper the most experience, because you can be third goalkeeper on the training pitch when you're at Manchester United or big clubs like that but it will never give you the experience from the field.",
      "\"The past three months it's another step forward for me from last year and there are players with more quality and different solutions in front of goal, so I need to make more quick decisions and be ready.\"",
      "While Vitek does not want to return to Old Trafford in the immediate future, he has signalled his desire to become the Red Devils’ starting goalkeeper in the long-term. He added: \"That's my plan but I will do my maximum for that and we will see - let's take game by game and now I'm focussing to play for Bristol City and do my best.",
      "\"One day it would be a dream to play for Manchester United but I take game by game and I know there's a big challenge in front of me but I want to improve every week.\"",
      "Vitek’s admission comes after a mass overhaul of United’s goalkeeping department this summer. Regular number one Andre Onana was loaned out to Turkish side Trabzonspor after a tricky couple of seasons at United.",
      "He was replaced as number one by reserve goalkeeper Atlay Bayindir, albeit the Turkish stopper had a number of error-strewn appearances. He too was then usurped in the pecking order by £18m summer signing Senne Lammens. The Belgian has impressed since arriving from Royal Antwerp. He has made five appearances for United so far, keeping one clean sheet and will likely start once again this weekend vs Everton.",

So far, a deal for Adeyemi has eluded them but that could soon be about to change with the January transfer window set to open in just a matter of weeks - particularly as the 23-year-old has seemingly already made his decision to leave Dortmund.",
      "As per Bild, Adeyemi wants to depart the club at the end of the season, with talks over a new deal having ground to a halt.",
      "The attacker's current deal runs until 2027 and he will only pen a new contract should a release clause be included - something that the German giants are not willing to compromise on.",
      "That could lead to Dortmund cashing in on Adeyemi instead of losing him for free in 18 months’ time. It is further suggested that the striker has penned a deal with super agent Jorge Mendes, with talks already underway with United and Inter Milan over a move.",
      "Adeyemi joined Dortmund from Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg in 2022 and has scored 29 goals in 121 appearances. Whether United manage to get a deal for Adeyemi over the line remains to be seen, albeit the Red Devils appear keen to bolster their midfield first.",

      "Former Arsenal forward Paul Dickov believes Danny Welbeck should consider staying at Brighton and snubbing a return to Manchester United.",
      "Welbeck, 34, has been linked with a surprise move back to Old Trafford after an impressive start to the season. Indeed, the England international has scored six goals in 11 top-flight appearances this term.",
      "He is the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League, with Burnley's Jaidon Anthony second on four and a number of players, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, on three.",
      "Welbeck's form has seen speculation increase that he could be poised for a shock return to the England squad for next summer's World Cup, with Thomas Tuchel not having an obvious deputy for Harry Kane.",
      "As well as that, Welbeck has been tipped to re-join United in the January transfer window, almost 12 years since he left the Reds to sign for Arsenal in a £16million transfer. The ex-Watford man came through the youth system at Carrington and scored 29 times in 142 matches for his boyhood club before joining the Gunners.",
      "But with Benjamin Sesko suffering a knee injury in United's 2-2 draw at Tottenham before the international break, the Reds could dip into the market for another No.9 in January - and Welbeck's name has been mentioned as a potential target. However, Dickov doesn't think Welbeck should rush back to United.",
      "Speaking to Best Betting Bonuses, former Manchester City and Leicester ace Dickov said: \"It would be a big shout, actually, wouldn't it? Danny's been excellent. He seems to get better as he gets older. I think he's the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"Danny's obviously a Manchester boy, came through the academy. But it'll be interesting to see what United do and for how long Sesko is actually out for.",
      "\"Because they spent big on him. He was the one that they wanted in the summer. But with strikers, and I know that myself, we're very selfish.",
      "\"Any striker joining United in the winter will know that Sesko will be coming back, and almost certainly play ahead of him. Are United going to go and spend big and get a centre-forward that's going to come in and then have two centre-forwards that have got a big price tag? Is one going to sit on the bench?",
      "\"Especially in the January market, it's really difficult to go out there and get the players that you want. Then I know with Danny Welbeck, if United come in, it’s not even certain he will want to leave Brighton or if Brighton would let him leave.",
      "\"At the back of his mind, he's going to be thinking ‘How many games am I going to play?’ Because when Sesko comes back, he's probably going to be the main No. 9 that they've got in their squad. So it's a really difficult one for him.\"",
      "Welbeck has a solid record while playing for England, netting 16 goals in 42 caps. However, he hasn't made an appearance for the Three Lions since 2018, when he was at Arsenal.",

      "Just 18 months after being told to RETIRE by Jamie Carragher, Manchester United's veteran star Casemiro has been hailed as a “complete player” by a Premier League rival.",
      "The Brazilian has endured a rollercoaster spell at Old Trafford since his £60m move from Real Madrid. He impressed in his debut campaign but struggled in the following seasons, with reports at the time suggesting that the Red Devils were keen to cut their losses. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher suggested that he should start considering retiring with his infamous “leave the football before the football leaves you\" comment.",
      "Despite it appearing as though his career was winding down, Casemiro seems back to his best this season. The 33-year-old has been a consistent figure under Ruben Amorim, already scoring three goals throughout the campaign. And he has now earned praise from compatriot and Newcastle star Bruno Guimaraes. Speaking while on international duty, he said: “Look at his experience, his titles… he’s a complete player.",
      "“His career speaks for itself. In one of my first interviews with the national team, in 2020, when I arrived they asked if I was inspired by anyone in midfield, and I said his name, Casemiro.",
      "“He’s also an idol there for everything he’s done, especially at Real Madrid, the five Champions League titles. A guy that everyone who plays in Brazilian midfield talks about, Casemiro is the guy we have to follow.",
      "“So I think it’s a bit of everything, he’s a leader, certainly playing there as a number 8 is a position where I feel more comfortable, it’s a position I also play at Newcastle. I think it’s a perfect match and things are starting to go well.”",
      "Casemiro’s form and Guimaraes’ comments have certainly seen Liverpool icon Carragher eat his words. Speaking in May 2024, he said: \"I am nowhere near on a level of what that man has achieved, [winning] Champions League's, playing for Brazil and Real Madrid.",
      "\"But I always remember something when I retired myself, and there was a saying I always remember as a footballer: 'Leave the football, before the football leaves you'.",
      "\"The football has left him - at this top level. He needs to call it a day at this level of football and move.\"",

      "Scott McTominay has come a long way since he made his Manchester United debut under Jose Mourinho. And it was 'The Special One' who helped put McTominay on the path to becoming a Scotland hero during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay - whose latest act of heroism in a Scotland shirt inspired them to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998 - may no longer be a United player, but he has flourished at Napoli and was even named the best player in Serie A last season after moving overseas. It was evident during his Premier League days, though, that McTominay had bags of talent.",
      "Mourinho could see that and even felt, from a national team perspective, that England were taking far too long to give him an international call-up. And when Gareth Southgate didn't immediately act, Mourinho instead made sure that Scotland knew the door was open for them.",
      "McTominay qualified to play for them by virtue of his Helensburgh-born father and Alex McLeish was the Scotland manager at the time. When he sniffed an opportunity he didn't waste any time in heading south of the border to deliver his pitch - even if the weather almost cost him.",
      "He told the Telegraph: “Looking back now I suppose all of us Scots should say a little thank you to Jose Mourinho. Jose had given an interview in which he let it be known that England were in danger of missing out on Scott and that I should be getting in touch with him at the first opportunity!",
      "“So I arranged to go down to United’s training ground to see him and Scott. There was only one problem – the ‘Beast from the East’ was raging at the time and I almost didn’t make it!",
      "“I didn’t arrive into York until 3am and, at that point, I was seriously thinking about turning back, the weather was that bad. I eventually got to my hotel in Manchester Piccadilly, but I was so late they’d put me down as a no-show! So it’s gone 4am and I’m fearing I’ll be roomless. Luckily they found me one!”",
      "Mourinho appeared a man determined to give Scotland every chance to press their case to McTominay with the midfielder more than paying back that faith. He scored the opening goal on Tuesday night - one of 14 in his international career - and can now prepare for a World Cup campaign for the first time.",
      "McLeish added: “I rang Jose later that morning. ‘Come here for 12, let’s have lunch and a chat about Scott and then we’ll get him in the room'. He couldn’t have been more accommodating. I’d sensed Scott was keen, but I thought he’d still take a lot of persuading. He came in and was pretty clear in his own mind that he wanted to represent Scotland. I think he appreciated me going to see him, but it’s definitely fair to say it was one of the more worthwhile trips I’ve taken.”",

      "Rasmus Hojlund was criticised by his own fans after issuing his congratulations to Scott McTominay on social media in the aftermath of Denmark's qualifying failure.",
      "Scotland were able to leapfrog them to top their group, owing to two goals in stoppage time at Hampden Park. The hosts scored twice late on, the first coming from Kieran Tierney before Kenny McLean fired home from his own half. It lead to huge celebrations from the Scots, who made it to a World Cup for the first time since 1998. McTominay has been their talisman and scored the opening goal of the night on Tuesday.",
      "The midfielder has gone to another level since leaving Manchester United and heading to Naples. He was recently joined by Hojlund, who has made an initial loan move to Napoli. The Dane was on hand to wish his team-mate congratulations on Instagram, he commented on McTominay's post which read: “USA BABY. SCOTLAND ARE COMING!”",
      "Hojlund's response saw him cop it from fans immediately after as his competitive spirit appeared to be called one. One person wrote: “This guy ain’t serious.” Another added: “Bro you lost.” It must be said that a number of fans also praised his humility and sportsmanship.",
      "Several of his Danish team-mates didn't take the defeat well, which leaves them needing to negotiate the play-offs if they do want to make it to the World Cup. Joachim Andersen was particularly angered by how the evening played out, bemoaning some of Scotland's goals.",
      "\"I'm incredibly sad,\" Andersen told TV2 Sport. \"The results we've delivered in the last two games are laughable. I'm just disappointed. I'm disappointed. I think we played a good game. They score a freak goal. He'll never score a goal like that again in his career.\"",
      "\"Of course it's difficult when we get the red card,\" he added. \"And we fall behind and come back. And then we make such stupid mistakes. That should never happen. I don't know what to say. It's just disappointing and f****** ridiculous.\"",
      "Denmark boss Brian Riemer also delivered a put down to Scotland, despite just seeing his side lose out to them. \"I take responsibility 100 percent on my shoulders,\" he said. \"There is nothing to argue about. We met a team that is worse than ourselves today, and we have to beat them.\"",

      "Manchester United will be itching for a return to club football in order to extend the longest unbeaten run of Ruben Amorim's Old Trafford career. The Red Devils are without a loss in their last five Premier League games, which has marked a turnaround in the Portuguese's year-long tenure in England.",
      "Victories against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton sent United shooting up the table from 14th to sixth before settling in seventh after 2-2 draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "For the first time in a while at United, there seems to finally be an air of positivity surrounding Amorim and his squad. A victory on Monday against Everton would not only continue their unbeaten streak but could see them enter the Champions League places, albeit depending on other results, for the first time in over a year.",
      "Amorim has said that there has been a notable improvement in his side's performances, which, of course, leads to more positive results. However, the 40-year-old is still very much insistent that United are in the infancy of their long-term progression.",
      "The suitability of his much-criticised philosophy looks to grow stronger each week but he warned his players that the formation will not be enough to drag them to victory. Speaking to Stan Sport, he said: \"We are playing better, but we are playing better because we have more confidence, and that starts with good results, for example, against Liverpool.",
      "\"We are getting better, but I can share my feeling: when we finished the game against Tottenham and I was coming back to Carrington, I was watching the game and my feeling was frustration, that we are far from perfection.\"",
      "He told his players that desire, confidence and competitiveness are the attributes they must ingrain in themselves in order to become a winning machine. He added: \"We are far from being that team that can win every game.",
      "\"So I think we have a lot to do, but I also have the feeling, and I've been saying this for many months, that the formation is not the problem. The formation is the start of something, then it's the dynamic, the confidence, the way we play, how competitive we are.",
      "\"If you look at the games we struggled in this season, it was not about the formation for me. It was the lack of intensity. We need to be perfect in this league to win a lot of games.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken positively of Amorim's character but its results that define your job status in football. Aware of the time it would taken to transform the once dominant form in English football, the Manchester United co-owner revealed last month he'd grant Amorim three years in the job to do just that.",
      "\"I remember the clamouring for Alex Ferguson to be fired in his first two years\"’ the billionaire said on The Times’ The Business podcast. \"You look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time for the first couple of years.",
      "\"We’re results-driven at the end of the day, but we have to be patient and we have to see through the results. I think there’s lots of good things at Manchester United. We have to be patient and we have a long-term plan. It isn’t a light switch. Ruben needs to demonstrate that he’s a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Openly promising a certain amount of time to any manager is a bold move but it's a decision that paid off, according to Amorim. Continuing in his conversation with Stan Sport, he said Ratcliffe's comments had a \"huge\" influence on the team as he said: \"But if you remember when Jim gave that interview, that settled down a lot around the club.",
      "\"The noise around the club changed completely. So that was really important for the team and if it’s really important for the team, its really important for me. Those words had a huge impact. Not the way I do things but the way people see what we are doing so it was massive for us.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's £71million transfer this past summer came off the back of a career-best season where he scored 20 league goals for Brentford. After a slow start this season, Mbeumo, 26, has returned to form and has six goals to his name with four of them coming in his last four league games.",
      "As a left-sided goal-scoring winger, comparisons to Liverpool's Mohamed Salah have been made before but it's one Owen Hargreaves believes is accurate because of the Cameroonian's decision-making ability.",
      "\"I think his biggest attribute is that he gives real quality,\" the former United star said of Mbeumo. \"He reminds me of Mohamed Salah in and around the box. When he gets the ball, he has a clear picture of exactly what he wants to do. Whether the finish is near post or back post, he almost shows no emotion.",
      "\"It’s just business in and around the box, and I love that. You can play it into his feet, he can dribble. [Peter] Crouch mentioned his touch and how sharp he is but technically, I don’t think he gets enough credit. People talk about his goal-scoring and rightly so, but he is an exceptional football player.\"",

      "Former Arsenal midfielder Stefan Schwarz has explained why he thinks a move to North London would be a good opportunity for Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo. Mainoo enjoyed a breakthrough season for United during the 2023/24 campaign, having progressed through the academy ranks at Old Trafford to become a first-team regular.",
      "Despite such a promising beginning to his footballing career, the 20-year-old reportedly indicated his intention to leave Old Trafford over the summer.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has opted for a midfield duo this season, with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes more often than not steering the side. This has resulted in Mainoo accumulating just 138 minutes on the pitch so far this season.",
      "Chelsea were reportedly interested in the young midfielder over the summer, though Arsenal have subsequently surfaced as a possible future destination. Schwarz believes it could prove a worthwhile switch for Mainoo.",
      "“Kobbie Mainoo’s links to Arsenal? Arsenal have the best conditions for young players,\" said Schwarz in an interview with Hajper. \"And they have a manager in Mikel Arteta that is not afraid to give responsibility to them and give them opportunities when he feels they are ready.",
      "“It's just about preparing them in the best way and that's what Arsenal have done very well the last couple of years.”",
      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has often been praised for his ability to nurture young talent from the academy to the first team. Bukayo Saka has blossomed into a star player under Arteta's guidance, with the Gunners boss honing the England international's wing play and making him the focal point of the attack.",
      "Ethan Nwaneri, at just 18 years old, has become an important squad rotation player for Arteta. Although he's not yet a regular starter, the faith shown in Nwaneri by the Arsenal boss paid dividends last season when the youngster netted nine goals and provided two assists in his breakthrough year.",
      "Max Dowman, aged only 15, made history as the youngest player ever to feature in a Champions League match when Arteta introduced him during the club's 3-0 triumph over Slavia Prague.",
      "One of Mainoo's standout attributes is his composed and mature presence in midfield. However, it seems that the young player has lost much of the responsibility that was once entrusted to him by Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim appears to favour a more experienced pairing with seasoned players Casemiro and Fernandes. However, should Mainoo make the switch to Arsenal this winter, it's possible that Arteta could restore that level of responsibility to the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo's impressive performances at United earned him a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad. Once again, the England boss showed enough trust in Mainoo to start him in the 2024 Euros final against Spain.",
      "Mainoo's contract with United runs until 2027. The midfielder is reportedly open to a loan move this season and has currently put any new contract discussions on hold.",

      "Gyokeres, 27, joined the Gunners in a blockbuster transfer from Sporting Lisbon in the summer and has scored six times in 14 games. However, question marks remain in some quarters over whether the Sweden international is the man to fire Arsenal to the title this season after three consecutive near misses under Mikel Arteta.",
      "Three of Gyokeres' four Premier League goals this term have come against relegation battlers Leeds and Burnley while others have questioned his all-round game.",
      "Rooney, though, has been impressed enough by the Swede to single him out alongside Antoine Semenyo and Bryan Mbeumo, who have been two of the Premier League's most deadly attackers so far this term.",
      "When he was put on the spot and asked to select his three top performers, The Manchester United and England legend told Amazon Prime: \"Top three, probably [Antoine] Semenyo, I think he’s been brilliant for Bournemouth, carrying on his form from last season.",
      "\"I’d also put Bryan Mbeumo in there. I think he’s been really good for Manchester United, even after a difficult start to the season for the club. I think he’s been really good.",

      "\"His work-rate and his determination to hold up play and he’s obviously scoring a few goals as well so I’d say that’s my top three.\"",

The forward has rediscovered his finest form at Barcelona, with Rashford joining the La Liga giants on a season-long loan during the summer, with the possibility to secure a permanent switch to the Camp Nou.",
      "United inserted a buy-option clause in the agreement valued at approximately £28million. Under manager Hansi Flick, Rashford has scored six goals and registered nine assists across 16 outings in all competitions.",
      "Strachan believes that the transfer has benefited both player and club, claiming it has also spared Ruben Amorim an additional dilemma in the changing room.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford was very good for England last week, but I maintain that Manchester United were right to part way with him,\" Strachan told ESports News. \"The time was right for both parties to move on, and it's been proven to have been the right decision.",

      "An underwhelming Team of the Week 10 has arrived on EA Sports FC 26.",
      "Gamers hoped it would be a big week for the promo with a number of top performers across the international break, namely Erling Haaland and Ireland's hat-trick hero Troy Parrott",
      "Neither of them feature, however, with the squad instead headlined by the 90-rated duo of Khadija Shaw and Mapi León from Manchester City and Barcelona respectively. That's not to say Mirror Gaming's early predictions were wrong entirely...we had a handful right!",
      "Other big players in TOTW 10 include PSG midfielder Joao Neves, Bayern Munich winger Serge Gnabry, as well as Man City pair Tijjani Reijnders and Joško Gvardiol.",
      "It replaces Team of the Week 9 which featured Lionel Messi's first in-form card of the season, alongside Jeremy Doku and Vitinha.",
      "Here's a full breakdown of the Team of the Week 10 squad for EA Sports FC 26 including some rather niche and surprise names.",
      "The new Team of the Week is available in packs in Ultimate Team right now with the full squad released at 6pm UK Time / 2pm EDT / 11am PDT on Wednesday (November 19).",

      "Manchester United are bracing themselves for a hectic January transfer window, but an injury to Benjamin Sesko could throw a spanner in the works. The Red Devils have just over a month to go until they can go into the market for potential new signings.",
      "Sesko was one of five new faces at Old Trafford this summer, joining Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon. Despite their summer spending spree, United are still rumoured to be eyeing more additions when the New Year rolls around.",
      "However, Sesko's injury set-back could force United to rethink their plans. The Slovenia international suffered a knee injury during United's 2-2 stalemate with Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, with rumours suggesting he could be out of action for up to a month.",
      "That could see Ruben Amorim having to re-shuffle his pack and rely on other squad members to step up in Sesko's absence over the coming weeks. One such player is Joshua Zirkzee, who has been heavily linked with a move away from United since the summer.",
      "Zirkzee has found game-time hard to come by at United this campaign and he's yet to be given a single start by Amorim - in any competition. In fact, the Netherlands international has made just four cameo appearances in the Premier League this term, totalling a mere 82 minutes on the pitch.",
      "Since his £37.4million switch to United in the summer of 2024, Zirkzee has only managed to net seven goals and rumours have been swirling about a potential exit from Old Trafford. With Sesko currently side-lined due to injury, this could provide Zirkzee with more opportunities to prove himself on the pitch in the coming weeks.",
      "Moreover, the Red Devils will need to put a plan into place for the squad changes that are expected in December and January. The Africa Cup of Nations is set to take place in the New Year, as well, which will see Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui representing their respective countries.",
      "This will leave United's forward line somewhat depleted, potentially leading to more game time for Zirkzee.",
      "Given the circumstances, it would not be a shock if United were to prevent Zirkzee from leaving Old Trafford, even if he expressed a desire to do so and an offer was on the table. Recent reports indicate United will indeed block any potential exit for Zirkzee due to the lack of senior forward options in the squad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's Lisandro Martinez has been spotted in training with Joshua Zirkzee during the November international break, sparking hope for his return to action. The Argentina centre-back has been side-lined since February due to a severe knee injury, but has recently returned to Carrington to regain full fitness.",
      "It was reported that Martinez was handed the green light to train with Argentina during their latest international break to boost his match fitness. However, it remains uncertain whether the ex-Ajax star will be fit enough to join United's squad for Monday night's showdown against Everton.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim is expected to provide an update during his pre-match press conference on Friday. And, if Zirkzee's latest Instagram story post is anything to go by, things are looking up for Martinez.",
      "The Netherlands international shared a picture of him with Martinez and several youth team players, hinting they won a practice match, with the Argentine coming through unscathed. He posted: \"Young lads made it easy for us @lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Amorim has previously confessed he doesn't want to pin down a date for Martinez's comeback to the matchday squad. But when probed about him in late October, the Portuguese boss expressed satisfaction with the progress being made.",
      "\"He's feeling well,\" the ex-Sporting head coach said. \"The knee is responding really well, so I don't want to say one specific day or one week.",
      "\"I don't know, but it's near to start the training with the team. Then it depends on the rhythm of Licha, if he wins the place or not, that will depend on him, but he's closer to return to training.\"",
      "The United boss has previously made clear just how much Martinez has been missed during his lengthy absence. Amorim's current centre-back options have struggled to play out from the back - a quality the World Cup winner possesses in abundance.",
      "\"We miss a lot, Licha, especially in this moment,\" he said. \"We miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him.\"",
      "It's little wonder, then, that United have increasingly opted to go more direct from defence; a tactic highlighted by Liverpool manager Arne Slot following his side's shock home defeat to Amorim's men last month.",
      "However, Martinez perhaps won't simply walk back into the Reds' defensive unit. Luke Shaw has featured in every Premier League match this campaign, operating as the left-sided centre-half, and looks set to retain his position for Monday's clash with the Toffees.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is poised to make his long-awaited return to competitive football this weekend. The Frenchman hasn't featured in a match for more than two years.",
      "He signed for Ligue 1 outfit Monaco during the summer following a seven-and-a-half month spell as a free agent. He departed Juventus in mid-November following a mutual termination of his contract.",
      "The 32-year-old had been serving a suspension after failing a drugs test, with his initial four-year ban cut to 18 months following an appeal. He became available for selection again in March this year, but didn't join Monaco until the summer.",
      "Despite being cleared to play, Pogba has yet to feature for Monaco this campaign whilst working to regain match sharpness. His comeback was initially scheduled for after the October international window.",
      "That target was subsequently delayed due to a minor setback in his fitness A fresh target date for the Paris FC fixture at the beginning of the month was then set.",
      "But those plans were once more thrown into disarray when the midfielder picked up an ankle problem during training. The injury further delayed the midfielder's debut.",
      "According to L'Equipe, Monaco are preparing to name Pogba in their matchday squad for Saturday evening's Ligue 1 clash with Rennes. If he takes to the field, it will mark the player's first appearance since 3 September 2023, when Juventus defeated Empoli 2-0 in Serie A.",
      "Discussing the ankle knock that ruled him out of the Paris FC encounter, Monaco manager Sebastien Pocognoli said: \"We are awaiting confirmation of the severity of the injury.",
      "\"The idea is that he can be available after the international break; that is the plan that we are following. We are all disappointed.\"",
      "Monaco currently sit sixth in the Ligue 1 table with a tally of 20 points from their first 12 matches and are set to face Rennes away this weekend, before jetting off to Cyprus for a Champions League group stage clash against Pafos on Wednesday night.",
      "Both squads have managed to secure five points from their initial four tournament games and are in 19th and 20th place in the league stage. Pogba's most recent Champions League outing was for United in the Last 16 showdown against Atletico Madrid back in March 2023.",
      "The midfielder enjoyed two stints at United, initially rising through the youth ranks between 2009 and 2012, prior to his transfer to Juventus.",
      "He then made return to Old Trafford in 2016, with a hefty price tag of £89 million. During his time there, he clocked up 233 appearances, netted 39 goals and delivered 51 assists.",
      "In 2022, he made a free transfer back to Juventus. His tenure at United saw him as part of the team that clinched the League Cup in 2010 and 2017, as well as the Europa League in the 2016/17 season.",

      "Manchester United have welcomed the announcement of the Greater Manchester growth plan unveiled by Andy Burnham, which has promised over £1billion worth of investment.",
      "The first-of-its-kind fund will involve more than 30 projects to be backed across the region. Greater Manchester's economic growth continues to outstrip the rest of the country with an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has stated every borough should benefit.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London. Burnham had said that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, but conversations had been ongoing about the regeneration project surrounding the stadium.",
      "Now, an initial commitment of £26m for 382 new homes as part of the Trafford Wharf development has been promised – the first major investment in the Old Trafford regeneration area.",
      "The investment for the area around Old Trafford is part of the Greater Manchester growth plan.",
      "Collette Roche, United chief operating officer, said: “We are delighted to see the Old Trafford regeneration project at the heart of Greater Manchester’s wider growth plan for the next decade.",
      "“We want to build the world’s best football stadium as a new home for Manchester United and a venue fit for the biggest international events, including the 2035 FIFA Women’s World Cup, surrounded by a vibrant business, leisure and residential district served by excellent transport links.",
      "“We are determined to play our part, together with other stakeholders, in making this vision a reality, and unlocking the huge benefits it can deliver for the surrounding community and wider region.”",
      "Burnham has hailed the Old Trafford regeneration project as the United Kingdom's largest sports-led scheme since the London 2012 Olympics, with around 15,000 homes set to be built alongside the new 100,000-seat football stadium, as well as areas for leisure and business.",
      "The Mayoral Development Corporation was recently established for the regeneration project, and Burnham confirmed Lord Sebastian Coe has been appointed as its chair designate.",
      "Burnham has outlined his vision for Greater Manchester to become “a second city to rival any other on the planet by 2050\" and every district to benefit from “regeneration at a pace and on a scale not seen before this century”.",
      "United must reach a deal to purchase the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford before they can push ahead with stadium plans. The land is owned by Freightliner, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement.",
      "Burnham has suggested compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal can not be agreed, but sources confirmed last month United were \"optimistic\" of reaching a breakthrough.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that academy players who are \"maybe not good enough\" to play for Manchester United could be sold to raise funds to work within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Nick Cox helped raise £100million from academy sales during his six-year stint as head of the youth system, but United's director of football Jason Wilcox has identified that as an area where improvement can be made.",
      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "United have a proud history of giving opportunities to young players, but some believe Amorim has not given enough chances to talented youngsters from the academy system.",
      "Speaking to Stan Sports, Amorim admitted that he found it difficult to prioritise academy players when he was first appointed. He also discussed why selling academy players has become increasingly important in the era of PSR rules.",
      "\"First thing, when I arrived last year, it was really tough,\" Amorim said. \"We had so many games but no time to prepare everything, to look around, to understand the game and the kids that are here, what is the plan for them and talk with all the coaches to try to arrange the perfect space to play.",
      "\"Under-18, Under-21, who is going to play where, so we are doing that now. I'm enjoying that part. I think it's going to be, like any club in the world, but especially here in England with the fair play. The players that you can put in the first team to feel the badge, but also the players that are maybe not good enough to play for Manchester United, but can give us some money when you sell them to try to compensate for the financial fair play to buy different players.",
      "\"So I think the future of our club is going to be the academy because, like you said, if you look at the biggest years with the most success was with the academy players.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"In the current moment, we also have that part if you sell a player from our academy, all the money you can use it to buy another. So I think we need to be really focused on that.",
      "\"Our sporting director has a background with the academies and young kids, so we are doing everything to put these kids in the first team for us to be competitive in any way in the Premier League.\"",
      "United banked £40m from the sale of Alejandro Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The sale represented 'pure profit' in the books and was the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) from Napoli for the sale of Scott McTominay in the summer of 2024. Amorim was asked to explain what he looks for in a young player, and he said: \"It's an honour to play for Manchester United. Sometimes, some kids take that for granted. That is the first thing.",
      "\"Then you have to look, to play in the Premier League nowadays, the physicality is something you cannot run from. You need to pay attention to that. Then you need to help the kids to cope with the media attention. That is something that we need to work and be really careful when one kid makes one game, not to make a big deal of that.",
      "\"And we had some issues in the past when we did that, and we got that wrong. And then the most important thing is talent and working hard. That is the things we are looking for from our players.\"",

Amorim picked up the Premier League's manager of the month award for October after wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which were followed by draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "United made a disastrous start to the campaign, suffering an embarrassing defeat against Grimsby Town before a thumping at local rivals Manchester City, but Amorim has overseen an impressive turnaround at Old Trafford.",

      "\"I'm ready for the future, I'm ready for the present. It was a really tough journey, but now I can see it as necessary and I think we are in a better place because of that.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"We are playing better because we have more confidence and that starts with the good results. For example, against Liverpool, but if you look at the game, we had some luck.",
      "\"And that changed the momentum for us. We did a very good pre-season, we started the season really well against Arsenal, and then we had our ups and downs until this point.",
      "\"That's what I was expecting. It's not a surprise for me that we are improving, we are getting better, but I can share my feeling when we finish the game against Tottenham. I came here at Carrington, watched the game [again] and my feeling was of frustration that we are far from perfection.",
      "\"We are far from the team that can win every game, so I think we have a lot to do, but I also have the feeling what I have been saying for many months is the formation is not the problem.",
      "\"The formation is the start of something, then it's the dynamic, the confidence, the way we play the game, how competitive we are. And if you look at the games we struggle this season, it's not about the formation for me, it's about the lack of intensity, and we need to be perfect in this league to win a lot of games.\"",

      "Asked if the Glazers had told him to sack the head coach, Ratcliffe replied: “It’s not going to happen.”",
      "Amorim reiterated that he appreciated Ratcliffe's backing. \"It's always really important,\" he said. \"But it's more important for the fans to understand we have a clear path and we're going to do everything.",
      "\"And no matter what, we are going to continue that path. For me, and I'm going to be really honest, doesn't change much because I'm not worried about losing my job. I always had that feeling. It's a good thing to hear, but it changes nothing in the way of how I behave. I know clearly what path I have to follow.",
      "\"If you remember when Jim gave that interview, it settled down the noise around the club, it changed completely. So that was really important for the team and me. So those words had a huge impact on not how I do things, but the way people see what we are doing, so it was massive for us.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs. They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament.",
      "Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining. It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "The defender started in United's opening two games of the Premier League season, however, he was dropped to the bench against Burnley before starting the next three games. Ruben Amorim dropped Dorgu again in a recent run of matches against Sunderland, Liverpool, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, preferring Diogo Dalot to start at left wing-back. Dalot struggled at the City Ground and Dorgu was recalled to face Tottenham before the international break.",
      "When fans have watched Dorgu this season, they have wanted Dalot to start at left wing-back. When Dalot has come into the team, they have wanted Dorgu to return to the side. The biggest criticism of Dorgu is his lack of end product. The 21-year-old often finds himself in promising positions down the left wing, but his crosses into the box leave a lot to be desired.",
      "Dorgu has recorded just a single assist this season, which isn't good enough considering the areas he roams into. The ball must have fallen to him in promising positions half a dozen times during the Manchester derby in September, and he wasn't able to carve out a goalscoring opportunity for a teammate.",
      "Although Dorgu was naturally disappointed after Denmark's defeat to Scotland, it was at least a reminder that he can provide value in the final third after an unconvincing spell in a United shirt. Dorgu is likely to start when United welcome Everton to Old Trafford on Monday night. Dalot needs to be taken out of the firing line, but he could be quickly recalled if Dorgu doesn't perform.",
      "There has been no perfect option for Amorim on the left side of the team, but Dorgu now has an opportunity to kick on following his goal for Denmark during the international break.",
      "While the Danish press were complimentary of Dorgu's goal against Scotland, they picked up on what every United fan has been saying: his crosses into the box weren't good enough.",
      "That is the area of Dorgu's game that must improve if he wants to establish himself as a consistent starter. Amorim's system relies on the wing-backs contributing in the final third.",
      "It must be factored in that Dorgu only arrived at Old Trafford from Lecce a little over nine months ago, but a new signing in his position may be considered if he doesn't start to perform.",
      "The good news is that Dorgu seems like a confidence player, someone who will perform better after scoring a goal. During his interview at Carrington in August, he admitted he took a shot from distance on the opening day of the season against Arsenal purely because his confidence levels had increased.",
      "Dorgu looked sharp throughout pre-season in the United States and approached the campaign full of confidence, but he hasn't played like someone brimming with self-belief in recent weeks.",
      "Perhaps regaining that confidence will be the key to Dorgu improving when domestic football returns.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog on Thursday, November 20.",
      "With the January transfer window fast approaching, United are at the centre of several rumours. Antoine Semenyo is currently the trending name ahead of the winter trading period with several Premier League teams keen to sign him from Bournemouth.",
      "Karim Adeyemi of Borussia Dortmund is a different attacker to be linked with an Old Trafford switch, though the chances of that actually happening seem low.",
      "Versatile Ajax star Jorthy Mokio is the latest midfield option to appear of interest to those at United with the almost certainly more expensive trio of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson also wanted.",
      "With all of that being said, MEN Sport has you covered with all of the latest transfer talk in our live blog below!",
      "Lisandro Martinez's absence from the Manchester United first team has been painstakingly long. The Argentine suffered an ACL injury against Crystal Palace in February and since then he has missed 35 United matches over 291 days.",
      "Much has changed for United since Martinez left the pitch at Old Trafford on a stretcher against the Eagles. Perhaps most notably, there is optimism that the club have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim. United are on a five-game unbeaten run and are good value for their position just a point outside the top four.",
      "Something else that has changed during Martinez's absence from the first-team squad is Casemiro's role in the team. The Brazilian has become an undroppable for Amorim having previously been written off by some.",
      "However, an impending problem will be concerning the Reds.",
      "Manchester United's chances of signing Borussia Dortmund star Karim Adeyemi have received a significant boost, with reports indicating the forward is actively planning his departure. The German sensation has been on the Reds' radar for some time as they look to enhance their attacking options under Ruben Amorim.",
      "While securing Adeyemi has proven elusive so far, the tide may be about to change with the January transfer window just around the corner - particularly as the 23-year-old appears set on leaving Dortmund. Bild reports that Adeyemi is eager to depart the club at the season's end, with contract renewal talks having hit a deadlock.",
      "However, Dortmund have reportedly slapped a £70 million price tag on him.",
      "Garnacho's future was cast into doubt at the end of last season following his comments about United's season which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League. The Argentine later secured a £40million move to Stamford Bridge, which Chelsea are understood to have offered Lavia as part of the deal for Garnacho at the time..",
      "The club were heavily linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba, though a move did not materialise due to his £100million price tag. The Daily Mail claims that it was Wilcox, who previously worked at Manchester City and Southampton, Lavia's two clubs before Chelsea, who asked about the 21-year-old's availability. However, United rejected the proposal due to fitness concerns.",
      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs.",
      "They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament. Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining.",
      "It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "Former Arsenal and Manchester City striker Paul Dickov has suggested that Danny Welbeck should think twice before leaving Brighton for a potential return to Manchester United. Welbeck, 34, has been linked with an unexpected move back to Old Trafford following his strong start to the season.",
      "The England international has netted six goals in just 11 top-flight appearances this campaign. He currently stands as the top-scoring Englishman in the Premier League, with Burnley's Jaidon Anthony trailing behind on four and several players, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, on three.",
      "Welbeck's impressive form has fuelled rumours that he could be in line for a surprise recall to the England squad for next summer's World Cup, especially given Thomas Tuchel's lack of clear alternatives to Harry Kane. In addition to this, Welbeck has been tipped to make a return to United in the January transfer window, nearly 12 years after he left the Reds to join Arsenal in a £16million deal.",
      "Alan Shearer has joined Jamie Carragher in delivering an Antoine Semenyo transfer verdict.",
      "The Bournemouth star could be on the move in the January transfer window if a team make it clear they will activate his £65million release clause by a certain date. Liverpool are the latest team to be linked while Manchester United and Tottenham made enquiries this past summer.",
      "Shearer has warned against Liverpool signing him however, with Milos Kerkez's early struggles at Anfield as his reference point.",
      "Speaking to Betfair, he said: \"Antoine Semenyo has been linked with a move to Anfield, now, I don't know what Liverpool's plans will be for next season but there'll be a huge list of Premier League clubs that have already enquired about him and would love him in the team because of the ability that he has.",
      "\"As we've seen with Kerkez, it's alright playing well at Bournemouth where it's a great football club, but in terms of size it's tiny compared to someone like Liverpool. I guess you can say that with most players.",
      "\"These clubs invest a lot of money into players, so they'll know everything they need to about the player already.\"",
      "Manchester United duo Harry Amass and Radek Vitek could find themselves as part of the senior squad next season, according to The Sun.",
      "Amass and Vitek are currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City, respectively, with the two academy graduates impressing thus far.",
      "It has been added in the report that there is a real chance for Championship loannees to break into the first-team picture the following year. Amass is highly-regarded at United and by Amorim with the 18-year-old making his competitive debut during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Vitek meanwhile, has only appeared in friendlies but could quite easily come into the fold with Altay Bayindir seeming destined to leave. However, if he does not make the step up, United will likely try to cash in while his stock is high.",
      "Alan Shearer, via Betfair, has told Ruben Amorim the absence of Benjamin Sesko because of a knee injury is not a disaster for Manchester United.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s injury won’t impact Man United too much. Ruben Amorim has already shown that if you're not up to it then he won't play you.",
      "He's already made enough big decisions not to be phased by what the outside noise is. I don't suspect that bothers him at all.",
      "He'd love Sesko to be fit, come off the bench and have an impact but he won't have that option.",
      "Given how well the likes of Cunha and Mbuemo have been since joining, it's not as if Sesko's injury is a disaster. Results are improving at Man United.",
      "Karim Adeyemi wants to leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the 2025/26 season, it has been claimed in Germany.",
      "As per Bild, the Germany international wants to leave next summer, with discussions over a new contract stopping as a result. Given his stance, a January exit cannot be ruled out.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for the versatile attacker. The 23-year-old has grabbed eight goal contributions from 19 appearances in this campaign.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo continues to be linked with a January loan move to Napoli.",
      "The Manchester United midfielder wanted to depart the club temporarily on deadline day in search of more minutes, but was told he would not be leaving Old Trafford. He has since played just 93 minutes of Premier League football.",
      "That has resulted in links to Napoli remaining with a mid-season switch now a seeming a real possibility, especially as he and Billy Gilmour share the same agent. CAA Stellar represent both midfielders and that could prove key in getting Mainoo to join.",
      "Manchester United are firmly in the market to sign a new midfielder with a dream transfer option appearing to have now emerged.",
      "According to The Daily Briefing. Ruben Neves is keen on a return to the Premier League when his contract at Al Hilal next summer.",
      "It’s also claimed that contact is already being made with Premier League sides with a deal that would see him join United 'on'. Tottenham have also been credited with an interest in the former Wolves star.",
      "If the 28-year-old does want to play in the Premier League next season, United could sign him on a free transfer, but there is likely to be serious competition if that scenario plays out.",
      "Matheus Cunha could help Manchester United sign Wolves' Joao Gomes if he is the midfielder they actively pursue.",
      "Cunha has spoken very highly of his fellow Brazilian. When he was asked who Gomes reminds him of, the forward made an exciting admission.",
      "\"Maybe Casemiro,\" he explained. \"He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro’s name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.\"",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has instructed his former club to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth in the January transfer window.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham have been linked with a move for the Ghana international but Carragher has explained why Arne Slot desperately needs him.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast,he said: \"I think they'll [Liverpool] have to recruit more physical players and maybe even in January.",
      "\"I’ve just seen the Semenyo [January release clause] come up and obviously he’s got the link with [sporting director] Richard Hughes. When you actually look at him as a player, lightening quick, big and powerful.\"",
      "Manchester United are the latest club to be linked with a move for Ajax teenager Jorthy Mokio.",
      "According to Sacha Tavolieri, there is transfer interest from Old Trafford in the 17-year-old, who can play in both midfield and defence, with Newcastle United and Eintracht Frankfurt also keen.",
      "He has added that Mokio is currently uncertain about Ajax's long-term project and is thus yet to sign a new contract despite the club's wishes. That hesitation could result in one of the three teams linked taking advantage.",
      "Manchester United are expected to be involved in the Antoine Semenyo transfer battle during the January transfer window.",
      "The winger is likely to depart Bournemouth given the £65million release clause in his contract and with United, Tottenham and Liverpool all interested.",
      "The latter appear to have the best chance of signing him with the Daily Mail (subscription required) describing Arne Slot's side as the frontrunners for his signature. It has been claimed however, that United are ones to watch in the battle to acquire his services.",
      "Karim Adeyemi appears unlikely to join Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Links to the Germany international had ramped up over the last few weeks but as things stand there is no active moves being made for him with transfer guru Fabrizio Romano revealing no approach or negotiations have started.",
      "United could certainly look to bring in an attacker in the January transfer window especially if one more injury strikes with Benjamin Sesko currently out while Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will be at AFCON.",
      "Hello and welcome back to our Manchester United transfer live blog!",
      "For the latest updates on Karim Adeyemi, Antoine Semenyo, Jorthy Mokio, Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba!",
      "Manchester United's Shea Lacey has long been touted as a star of the future - and it might not just be at club level. The 18-year-old has caught England's eye in recent weeks and months and again played a starring role on the international stage this week.",
      "The United prospect came off the bench to score for England Under-20s in their 1-1 friendly draw with Japan on Friday night, having only made his debut at that level last month.",
      "That outing came after the teenager was called up to train with the Under-21s - who beat Ireland 1-0 on Friday - where he received glowing praise from boss Lee Carsley.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund's transfer value has increased yet again as he continues to enjoy his loan spell away from Manchester United. Hojlund left United to join Napoli on a season-long loan deal, which also includes an obligation to buy.",
      "The reigning Serie A champions will have to pay United €44million (£38.8million) next summer provided certain conditions are met. The Reds have already received a €6million (£5.3million) loan fee from Napoli, which could mean the total fee for the transfer would reach €50million (£44.1million) if the permanent transfer is completed.",
      "Hojlund left Old Trafford in the summer after scoring 26 goals across two seasons at United, and managed 10 across the entirety of the previous campaign. Since signing for Napoli, the Denmark international has four goals to his name across his first 10 appearances.",
      "Manchester United are already being tipped to have a busy January transfer window, but Benjamin Sesko's injury could have the opposite effect. United have just over a month to go until they are allowed to go into the market for new signings once again.",
      "Sesko was one of five new additions to the United squad in the summer, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all moving to Old Trafford. Despite making big moves in the transfer market a few months ago, United are still being linked with making further additions in the New Year.",
      "However, the recent injury to Sesko could prompt a change in strategy from United. The Slovenia international suffered a knee injury during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, with reports suggesting that he is expected to be sidelined for up to a month.",
      "As a result, Ruben Amorim could be forced to turn to other members of his squad to fill the void left by Sesko's absence for the next few weeks.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Gordon Strachan believes letting Marcus Rashford depart has proven to be the right decision by the club, as he has rediscovered his best form at Barcelona.",
      "The 28-year-old winger joined the Spanish giants on a season-long loan in the summer, with the option to complete a permanent move to the Camp Nou. United included an option-to-buy clause in the deal worth around £28million.",
      "Under manager Hansi Flick, the winger has scored six goals and provided nine assists in 16 appearances across all competitions. Strachan believes the move has worked out in favour of both player and club, having saved Ruben Amorim an extra headache in the dressing room.",
      "Matheus Cunha labelled Ruben Amorim \"a winner\" when asked about the Manchester United boss while on international duty. The Reds signed Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves in the summer.",
      "The early part of the campaign was particularly challenging for the club, increasing the pressure on Amorim. However, recent weeks have brought some relief and Cunha has expressed his admiration for the Portuguese coach and teammate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez has shown encouraging signs in training after being pictured with Joshua Zirkzee during the November international break. The Argentine has been out of action since sustaining a serious knee injury in February.",
      "However, the 27-year-old has since returned to training at Carrington as he works his way back to full fitness. Reports suggest that Martinez was granted permission to train with Argentina during the international break to build match fitness.",
      "It is currently unclear whether the former Ajax star will be fit enough to be included in United's squad for Monday night's clash against Everton, however. Reds boss Ruben Amorim is expected to provide an update during his pre-match press conference on Friday. And the latest signs are looking good for Martinez if Zirkzee's latest Instagram story post is anything to go by...",
      "The January transfer window may be a notoriously difficult month for clubs to do business, but for Manchester United and other top teams it can present an opportunity. Players who are out of contract in the summer can speak to overseas clubs as early as January.",
      "If you are club like United where there are a number of players out of contract at the end of the campaign, you need to decide what the plan is for them before January rolls around. If you don't, you risk losing players who you may wish to keep. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at five players United must make decisions on before the January window opens.",
      "Furthermore, United will be in FA Cup third round action on the weekend of January 10, another fixture those players could be ruled out of. Ruben Amorim was asked about AFCON at a recent press conference and said: “We have time to suffer with that. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew [that].",
      "\"It is going to be an opportunity because when I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it is hard with one game to take some players from the team because they are going well also, during training and the games. Other players are going to have the opportunity to help us, they are understanding the way we want to play. The change of characteristics are not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team, but let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and then we will see in January.”",
      "Amorim will have the option of promoting young players in the absence of Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui, but which academy players have a chance of contributing to the first team?",
      "Bruno Guimaraes has described Manchester United midfielder Casemiro as a \"complete player\". Casemiro has become an important player for club and country again, starting nine games in the Premier League and forcing his way back into Brazil's starting team under Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "The 33-year-old has scored against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest this season, and a conversation about whether he merits a contract extension has started among supporters. Casemiro has been representing Brazil during the international break. Newcastle captain Guimaraes sat down for a chat with Globo Esporte and he said he had been \"inspired\" by Casemiro.",
      "When asked why he rates Casemiro so highly, Guimaraes said: \"Experience, titles... he's a complete player. His career speaks for itself. In one of my first interviews with the national team, in 2020, when I arrived they asked if I was inspired by anyone in midfield, and I said his name, Casemiro.",
      "Read more here",
      "Casemiro has easily been one of Manchester United's best players this season. The 33-year-old impressed in the Europa League last term but in the Premier League, where the pace is so fast, he faltered. And yet, this season he has looked a different player in the English top flight.",
      "He has anchored the midfield and given Bruno Fernandes the freedom to push forward. However, he has also been a threat in the opposition box. Only Bryan Mbeumo has scored more than Casemiro for United this season, but with his contract expiring next summer, the Reds have a decision to make.",
      "United could still extend his stay by a further year. It is believed the Reds would be happy to extend his contract, but only if he was willing to agree to a pay cut. If that agreement cannot be reached, United will lose their defensive midfielder and suddenly the search for his replacement becomes a priority. So far, the likes of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba have been mentioned as options to replace Casemiro.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Joachim Andersen was visibly upset during a live TV interview after Denmark's guaranteed World Cup spot was dramatically taken by Scotland, with Scott McTominay's overhead kick leaving him in complete shock. Late goals from Kieran Tierney and Kenny Maclean secured the win for Scotland, despite Denmark twice equalising.",
      "Former Manchester United star McTominay eased the tension at Hampden Park just three minutes into the game when he instinctively responded to a Ben Gannon Doak cross with an audacious overhead kick. Denmark later equalised through Reds loanee Rasmus Hojlund, whose penalty followed a foul by Andy Robertson, before Lawrence Shankland put the hosts back in the lead.",
      "Rasmus Kristensen was shown a red card 15 minutes prior, but Denmark rallied once more with Patrick Dorgu netting a loose ball to level the score again. However, Steve Clarke's team ultimately triumphed when Kieran Tierney scored from distance in stoppage time, and Kenny McLean stylishly confirmed their place at next summer's tournament by lobbing Kasper Schmeichel from inside his own half.",
      "Read more here",
      "Mason Greenwood's decision to snub a call-up to the Jamaica national team has been all but justified, after the Reggae Boyz missed out on automatic qualification for the World Cup.",
      "Steve McClaren had hoped that former Manchester United forward Greenwood would represent Jamaica after it was announced that he had filed papers to request a switch in his international allegiance.",
      "Reports last week, however, emerged that Greenwood, 24, is instead 'obsessed' with representing England again, more than five years since he made his Three Lions debut against Iceland. Although England head coach Thomas Tuchel has made it clear he is not in his thinking, Greenwood is still determined to return to international football with the Three Lions.",
      "Manchester United approached Chelsea to enquire about the availability of Romeo Lavia in the summer transfer window, but at no point did higher-ups at Stamford Bridge put the 21-year-old midfielder on the table.",
      "Meanwhile, the Blues pushed to sign Alejandro Garnacho from United, and Enzo Maresca eventually secured his signature at the end of August as part of a deal worth just £40m."

      "The striker's current contract runs until 2027, and he will only agree to a new deal if it includes a release clause - a stipulation that the German giants are reluctant to accept.",
      "This could lead Dortmund to cash in on Adeyemi rather than risk losing him on a free transfer in 18 months.",
      "It's also suggested that the forward has signed up with super agent Jorge Mendes, with discussions already underway with United and Inter Milan regarding a potential move.",
      "Adeyemi made the move to Dortmund from Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg in 2022 and has scored 29 goals in 121 appearances.",

      "Lisandro Martinez has agreed with Joshua Zirkzee's praise of Manchester United young stars who joined them in training as he continues to step up his recovery. The Argentine has been absent with a severe knee injury since February, but is expected to back in action over the coming weeks.",
      "Given the severity of his muscular problem, Martinez has been managed carefully with his return to running on the grass coming several months ago. The 27-year-old is now back training with his teammates on a full-time basis, but the majority of those have been away from Carrington for the last ten days.",
      "The likes of Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee have been alongside him though as they were not called up to represent England and the Netherlands, respectively. This meant several United academy stars were called up to first-team training.",
      "Zirkzee and Martinez appeared to be on the winning team of their small-sided game at Carrington as the former wrote to Instagram: \"Young lads made it easy for us @lisandromartinezzz.\" The defender later reposted that to his story with red heart and flexed arm emojis.",
      "If it was down to Martinez, he would have likely returned several weeks ago, but Amorim admitted before the draw with Nottingham Forest that certain things in his training plan had to be altered. He said: \"He wants to go to this one, he is not going to, he is going to take time.",
      "\"He started training with us, but we had to change some things in the exercise for him, so slowly he is going to get better. He is really good. He gives us that edge in every training session.\"",
      "United have mostly struggled in his absence with their ability to build up from the back and and defend aggressively heavily impacted.",
      "Luke Shaw has also spent some time in the treatment room with Martinez over the last few months, but he is now back in the team and performing well.",
      "Amorim appears to have found a new role for Shaw which sees him as the most aggressive of the three centre-backs, often next to Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt on the left.",
      "That involves him jumping out to press the No.10s looking for space between United's back three and midfield two, something he did very well in the victory over Brighton up against Georginio Rutter.",
      "Martinez is almost certainly perfect for that role, but it could be some time before he is in it regularly with Shaw performing well and no European football at Old Trafford this season. However, United still have ten fixtures over the next six weeks which makes it likely Martinez will feature.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will all be absent for what Amorim will hope is a small period during that run with the limits of his squad set to be tested.",
      "Those three attackers being unavailable could see Zirkzee come into the fold with the 24-year-old playing just 90 minutes of football so far this season.",

      "Manchester United can count their lucky stars that they never broke the bank to sign Evan Ferguson.",
      "United had tracked the Irish striker for years, with scouting reports dating back to his teenage days at Bohemians. The club even came close to a £50million move last summer - a dream destination for Ferguson, who admitted to supporting United as a boy.",
      "\"I supported United as a boy,\" Ferguson told the Daily Mail. \"You had the Rooneys, the [Dimitar] Berbatovs and obviously Danny Welbeck. They’ve always had a good thing going with the striker.\"",
      "But Ferguson's career has stalled in recent years, and he's now struggling at Roma with no goals to his name this season. He has recently been battling an injury, but could soon find himself facing the prospect of less game time.",
      "That's because Roma are interested in signing Joshua Zirkzee, a player who is well down Ruben Amorim's pecking order and has seen just 90 minutes of action all season.",
      "The fact that Roma are planning to effectively replace a striker who was considered one of the world's brightest prospects only a few years ago with Zirkzee speaks volumes about his drop-off.",
      "In hindsight, United can count themselves fortunate they never pulled the trigger, especially considering their history with expensive mistakes.",
      "Whether or not United allow Zirkzee to leave in January is another matter. Benjamin Sesko's knee injury presents a potential pathway back into the first team, though Matheus Cunha is expected to be Amorim's go-to man in the Slovenian's absence.",
      "Sesko could be out for three to five weeks, so Zirkzee has a window to show his worth. With attackers Amad and Bryan Mbeumo heading to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to represent Ivory Coast and Cameroon, respectively, United will be short of attacking players, with reports earlier this year claiming that Zirkzee won't be allowed to leave in January as a result.",
      "The 24-year-old has been linked with a move away in the New Year with hopes of getting more regular first-team action ahead of the World Cup next summer. The Daily Mail claim that Roma is one of striker's main options and that the striker will push for a move away if minutes between now and the transfer window don't prove forthcoming.",
      "The report added that those close to the player feel a 'crucial opportunity' is opening up for the 24-year-old due to Sesko's injury but only time will tell if he benefits from it or not.",
      "Roma will be monitoring the situation closely, with an eye on pursuing a loan with an option to buy. Their interest in him perhaps comes as no surprise, given Ferguson, 21, has zero goals in 10 appearances this season.",
      "Artem Dovbyk has also regularly led the line for Roma but has hardly been prolific himself, with two goals in 14 games.",
      "Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini previously called on Ferguson to do more but has vowed to be patient with him. \"He has to deliver on the pitch and his performances haven't been positive,\" he said last month.",
      "\"To be honest, yesterday was the first time I saw him train properly. He's coming from the Premier League, and he hasn't played much last season. We need to be patient with him.\"",
      "However, reports in Italy claim that Roma want to renegotiate the terms of the loan deal, with the 21-year-old potentially returning to the Seagulls in January.",
      "United have made plenty of errors in the transfer market in the past and come under scrutiny for it. Ferguson's name could've been added to that list, given how his career has gone since his breakthrough at Brighton but the club got it right this time by holding fire.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes the mindset of his Manchester United players needs to change when they hold the lead in games. The Reds were leading 1-0 at Tottenham before the international break but had to settle for a point after a disappointing second half display.",
      "The same thing happened at Nottingham Forest a week earlier, where United struggled in the second half after dominating the first. In the victory over Brighton, the Reds were almost punished when they were pegged back to 3-2 having been cruising earlier in the contest.",
      "In an interview with the Premier League, Amorim was asked why there has been such drop-offs from his team of late. He replied: \"I think we lose intensity. I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together. We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Amorim's thoughts are shared by his United players. Speaking after the Spurs draw, Matthijs de Ligt explained how fatigue played a role in the result. He said: \"Luckily we got a point, I think we deserved more the way we played, I felt the second half we were a little tired. We didn't get the chance to get out of our half.\"",
      "Next up for United is a clash with Everton at Old Trafford on Monday.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Scott McTominay and his international teammates can proudly sit alongside the likes of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce on the list of Scotland's national heroes. The pubs and bars of Scotland toasted McTominay on Tuesday as the midfielder played a crucial role in securing World Cup qualification for the first time since 1998.",
      "Scotland won 4-2 against Denmark to seal their place at next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. McTominay was born in England and qualifies for Scotland through his father, but there is no English blood in McTominay's veins as far as the Scots are concerned.",
      "The adulation McTominay receives with Napoli and Scotland is something he didn't get during his time at Manchester United, the club that moulded him into a man from the academy.",
      "The 28-year-old departed United to join Napoli last year and won the Scudetto in his first season. He was nominated for the Ballon d'Or and ranked as the 18th best player in the world.",
      "McTominay's breathtaking acrobatic goal against Denmark wasn't even a shock because that kind of strike has become his level now - his story since leaving United has been phenomenal.",
      "The execution was outstanding and it will be remembered as one of the great goals in Scotland's history. It was so good that it will be compared to Gareth Bale's bicycle kick in the Champions League final against Liverpool in 2018, and Wayne Rooney's effort against Manchester City in 2011.",
      "McTominay was a good player during his time at United, had achieved his dream of playing for his boyhood club and had played in the Champions League, but he has moved onto another level since moving to Naples.",
      "When McTominay signed for Napoli, there was a conversation about whether United were right to sell him, and the chatter has started again following a hugely successful 18 months.",
      "A few months after McTominay's departure, he admitted that it was a \"huge decision\" to leave United, but he said he had no regrets. McTominay needed to leave the club to progress and United were ultimately right to sell him, despite the level he is performing at now.",
      "McTominay scored 10 goals in all competitions in his last United season. He tended to produce when United needed a goal, scoring a brace against Brentford in October's 2-1 win, twice against Chelsea in December in another 2-1 victory and netting the winner against Aston Villa in February.",
      "However, he was not a regular starter and contributed mostly from the bench, which led Scotland manager Steve Clarke to suggest that he looked unhappy. \"I thought: Maybe he's right,\" he said last year.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) for McTominay and inserted a 10 per cent sell-on clause into the deal. The transfer represented 'total profit', which helped United operate within Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR), and it helped to offset incomings that summer.",
      "The club needed to raise cash to alleviate PSR pressure and McTominay wanted to leave. The second point is that McTominay wouldn't have reached his current level if he had stayed in Manchester.",
      "McTominay needed a fresh start. He needed to play somewhere where he would be a key player. He has grown with that responsibility for club and country, but McTominay was never going to be the 'main man' at United, who theoretically should have more naturally 'talented' players.",
      "The final point is that even if McTominay had stayed at United in the summer of 2024, he likely would have felt compelled to leave the club following Ruben Amorim's appointment.",
      "McTominay wouldn't have fitted into Amorim's system and would have been limited to substitute appearances. Just look at Kobbie Mainoo, who can't get a kick because Amorim doesn't believe he is a player of the right profile. Mainoo has been given something to think about watching McTominay.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were signed in the summer to start in the No.10 roles. McTominay would have been behind that pair in the pecking order, and he would have also been down the pecking order if he had been regarded as a deeper midfielder, like Mainoo has this season.",
      "It's understandable that some fans have said United should have kept McTominay on the back of his success, but logic dictates it was right for both parties to go their separate ways.",
      "United still miss McTominay in some ways. Different sources who have been present at Carrington over the last few years all praised McTominay's character and his behaviour around the training ground with staff members and young players. He was a leader and understood the club.",
      "There were some brilliant moments during McTominay's time at United, like his performance against PSG in the Champions League in 2019, his goal against Manchester City in the last game at Old Trafford before the pandemic and, of course, his brace against Brentford during his final season.",
      "But McTominay had to leave Old Trafford to really spread his wings.",

      "It was a sight for sore eyes this week as images from Carrington were released. Front and centre in the Manchester United training photos was Lisandro Martinez, celebrating another milestone since his ACL injury picked up vs Crystal Palace in February.",
      "It was a measure of Martinez's character that he has been pushing for a return to the first-team squad for weeks. Ruben Amorim admitted he told the defender he could not travel for the trip to Nottingham Forest last month.",
      "He was not risked a week later either for the draw at Tottenham Hotspur and his absence was understandable. Martinez has been out since February and rushing the defender back, potentially aggravating the injury further would have been a foolish decision having come this far on his recovery.",
      "Missing out on the Spurs game almost guaranteed we would see Martinez back among the first-team when they returned to Carrington post-international break and that is how it shaped up. However, his role at the club has changed beyond what anyone was expecting.",
      "When he left the field against Palace, United were losing more than just a member of their leadership group. Martinez was the leading defender at the club and a guaranteed starter in the back five, considering the lack of options available to Amorim.",
      "But when he returns this weekend, he will find that his once guaranteed starting spot in the United team now belongs to Luke Shaw. When Martinez joined the injury room at Carrington, Shaw was there waiting for him as he continued his recovery from a muscular injury.",
      "That was his third major injury of the 2024/25 season and it was looking unlikely Shaw would ever be in a position again to challenge for a regular starting XI position. Fast forward to November, and Shaw has featured in 11 straight Premier League matches for the first time since 2023.",
      "The Englishman is there on merit too. Barring the much-publicised disappointing performance against Manchester City, Shaw has been one of the top performers on the left of the back three, and it was surprising not to see him called up for England.",
      "Coming back into the fold at United, Martinez now faces the prospect of being forced to wait for his chance in the starting XI. The Argentine will have expected to be eased back into the first-team but even when fully fit, he is waiting for Shaw to slip up to take his chance.",
      "This will be a challenge that Martinez will undoubtedly relish but it is a big 18 months ahead for the 27-year-old. He is out of contract in the summer of 2027 and if he doesn't manage to replace Shaw, there's a chance his time at the club could be coming to an end.",

      "Lisandro Martinez's absence from the Manchester United first team has been painstakingly long. The Argentine suffered an ACL injury against Crystal Palace in February and since then he has missed 35 United matches over 291 days.",
      "Much has changed for United since Martinez left the pitch at Old Trafford on a stretcher against the Eagles. Perhaps most notably, there is optimism that the club have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim. United are on a five-game unbeaten run and are good value for their position just a point outside the top four.",
      "Something else that has changed during Martinez's absence from the first-team squad is Casemiro's role in the team. The Brazilian has become an undroppable for Amorim having previously been written off by some.",
      "However, an impending problem will be concerning the Reds. Casemiro is the only defensive midfielder in the squad who has Amorim's trust. Manuel Ugarte is the Brazilian's back-up but the Uruguayan has struggled since moving to Old Trafford and has yet to show the club the form he produced under Amorim at Sporting.",
      "While Casemiro is fit and firing this isn't so much of an issue. However, the 33-year-old finds himself just two bookings away from a suspension and he's also no stranger to suspensions due to red cards.",
      "Since arriving at Old Trafford, the Brazilian has missed ten matches due to suspension. He picked up a needless red card earlier in the season against Chelsea for a foul an experienced player like him shouldn't have been making.",
      "There's also the issue of the Christmas schedule on the horizon. At 33 Casemiro will struggle to play to his best every three or four days and yet it's tough to see Amorim showing faith in Ugarte and affording Casemiro a rest.",
      "Ugarte was off the pace when brought on against Tottenham and it was no surprise that both the goals they conceded at Spurs came after Casemiro had been replaced by Ugarte. Until United can delve into the transfer market and sign a midfielder, Amorim needs to find a solution to this problem from within his current squad. And Martinez could be an option.",
      "In the 2019/20 season, under the management of Erik ten Hag, Martinez played 22 times as a defensive midfielder for Ajax. Martinez is more than capable of breaking up play and also has the passing range needed to play in midfield.",
      "Moving Martinez into midfield is certainly not a long-term solution and United will sign a midfielder in the summer, but he is an option for the foreseeable.",
      "Ten Hag admitted back in 2021 that he didn't think Martinez \"had the legs\" to play in midfield. However, United have worked hard to ensure Casemiro isn't exposed and left with too much ground to cover, so this might not be so much of an issue were Martinez to move into midfield.",
      "Amorim knows he needs as many options at his disposal as possible heading into the festive period, especially in midfield to support Casemiro.",
      "Even if it is not the ideal solution, it is at least an option for the United head coach.",

      "The loan spell to Catalonia was the last throw of the dice for Rashford. His bridges were burnt with Ruben Amorim and, for all involved, the best thing to do was to let him leave.",
      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",
      "He joined the Camp Nou club on a season-long loan with the option to purchase him in the summer. If all goes according to plan for United, Rashford will impress, Barca will trigger that option and the winger's time in Spain continues.",
      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "With that in mind, United know what they can't do. Sell Rashford to a Premier League rival. In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",
      "If he was to impress in the Premier League, suddenly Rashford becomes a more prominent issue for the United head coach. So ideally United must find a way of making things work with Barca. The alternative of him returning to England with Chelsea or Spurs is not worth thinking about.",

      "There were several players from the academy sent on loan to gain experience. Some of those youngsters are excelling, while others have not made the impact they might have hoped. United loaned 18 players in total - and here is how they are faring this season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with a 12-point deduction due to their ownership situation, but they were able to promise regular game time to Amass, who has made 11 starts. The youngster scored his first senior goal against Southampton and United are delighted with his stint so far.",
      "Collyer was limited to seven substitute appearances after his arrival. He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he picked up a muscle injury.",
      "Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers. The youngster joined Fleetwood on a season-long deal for this campaign and he has started eight league games. Has contributed two goals and an assist during his positive loan spell in League Two.",
      "Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January, but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. Has started in 15 games in League One and has been one of their best players.",
      "Onana has received praise in the Turkish media since his move to Trabzonspor, who have lost just once in the league from a possible eight games since he signed. The 29-year-old has recorded three clean sheets and helped Trabzonspor to third in the table.",
      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. In his absence, another young goalkeeper came into the side and has earned first-choice status over Harrison.",
      "Hugill started the first two games of the season for Barnet in League Two, but he picked up an injury and has been absent since.",
      "Defender Aljofree started the first eight games of the campaign and notched a goal but he has lost his starting role over the last few weeks. The 20-year-old was not in the squad for Notts County played Harrogate Town last weekend.",
      "Solihull Moors are midtable in the National League. Jackson started in their first two games of the season, but he has struggled to make the XI since. The centre-back has been absent from their last five matchday squads.",
      "Hojlund made an excellent first impression in Naples, scoring twice against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League shortly after his arrival, but he has scored just four goals in total. Hojlund has copped some flak from the Italian media for his recent performances. Napoli won Serie A last season but sit fourth.",
      "Kana-Biyik recently scored his first senior goal. He salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break.",
      "Moorhouse has made 15 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient, but just four of those have been league starts. The youngster has shown glimpses of quality from the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed Newport County. That might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad, but the youngster has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",
      "Barcelona seemed a great fit for Rashford to rediscover his form. The United academy graduate has contributed six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances this season, and has looked back to his best.",
      "Rashford has been revitalised by leaving on loan - but Sancho continues to be in a slump. The winger has not started for Aston Villa in the Premier League and has failed to record a goal or an assist.",
      "Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping five clean sheets. The 22-year-old has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: “He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "Wheatley needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 13 starts in League Two for Northampton and has found the back of the net twice, as well as recording two assists.",
      "Williams is performing well north of the border. Has contributed a goal and three assists in nine appearances in the Scottish top-flight for Falkirk, who are exceeding expectations by sitting fifth in the table.",

Iqbal came off the bench against Young Boys in December 2021 and at that stage in his career it looked only a matter of time until he was handed more regular opportunities.",
      "Chances may not have materialised at Old Trafford but Iqbal and his Iraq team-mates have a significant one tonight. A win against the United Arab Emirates in the home leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off will keep alive the dream of qualifying for the tournament next summer.",
      "Iqbal, who was the first Iraqi to play for United, came off the bench in last week's first leg, which ended 1-1 and leaves Iraq as marginal favourites to progress. Should they prevail they will enter a six team inter-continental play-off in March. Their world ranking is likely to see them go straight into one of the two finals and thus one win away from the World Cup.",
      "For Iraq that would be a first appearance since their sole qualification in 1986. For Iqbal it would be the latest piece of history and perhaps vindication for opting to leave United and move to Utrecht in the Netherlands.",
      "The tipping point for the now 22-year-old was a lack of opportunities and a seeming lack of trust from then manager Erik ten Hag in granting him a first team chance during the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "\"I thought I would get a chance and unfortunately I didn’t,\" said Iqbal in an interview last summer. \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",

From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the Under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton. I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training. I was starting as a 10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'. It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "Iqbal turned down the chance to play at the Under-19 World Cup in April 2023 after Ten Hag told him he wanted to retain him as part of the United senior squad, but no club minutes followed and that summer he left for the Netherlands for a fee in the region of £1million.",
      "Injury has hampered his opportunity for regular minutes in Holland but he is closing in on 50 senior opportunities for the club and is a regular for the national team, scoring a crucial goal in a victory over Indonesia earlier this season. He'd love another against the UAE this afternoon (4pm), it would be the latest chapter of a history-making career.",

Mount has sent a video message to Lewis Rimmer's wife, Sarah, and two daughters, Amelia and Maddison, in the aftermath of a Range Rover hitting him and causing 'life-changing' injuries.",
      "He remains 'critically ill' in hospital after being put in an induced coma, his close friend Andy Tonge has told the MEN. Tonge described the message as 'lovely' for the family. The Bolton News quotes him as saying: \"They're big Manchester United supporters, so this was lovely to receive, what a guy.\"",
      "Mount is said to have shared his condolences and expressed his sorrow at hearing what happened to Rimmer. He also relayed that \"everyone at Manchester United is thinking of them and sending all their love.\" A fundraiser set up by friends to raise money for the family has received over £100,000 in donations.",
      "Tonge has said: \"The incident seems to have really struck a chord with people. It happened during half term, and it’s shocked so many because it could so easily have been a child who might not have been as strong as Lewis is proving to be.",
      "\"Many feel that Lewis’ strength and fight over the last few weeks is nothing short of remarkable.",
      "\"The fact that it took place at a local supermarket, used by so many of us, has created an even stronger sense of, 'This could have happened to anyone of us.'\"",
      "Tonge added: \"Lewis, unfortunately, is still critically ill and remains in an induced coma, three weeks on. Sarah and the family have been by his side every single day, and the fundraiser has genuinely lifted them.",

      "Modern football is often a reflection of the world surrounding it.",
      "When the older generations were watching the sport in the 1960s and 1970s, discussions surrounding the mental stability of a player or the squad was rarely aired. However, as the world became more aware of the challenges of mental health, football has accepted it and now each Premier League club takes into account the psychological fortitude of a player during every aspect of their career - all the way from scouting to the day they depart.",
      "Manchester United are no exception and within their current squad there are two players who are facing mental challenges which shall be putting them to the test. First, is Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Little more than a year after suffering a severe foot injury, the Argentine damaged his ACL and has been sidelined since February. He is now back with the United camp as he continues his recovery and his return to the pitch is expected before the festive period.",
      "But managing to navigate past the mental barrier of returning to professional football will be the crucial step in Martinez's recovery. Specialist in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University Dr Martin Turner, who has worked with The FA and Scarlets Rugby, believes the 27-year-old could come back a stronger athlete.",
      "\"I imagine he [Martinez] will be worrying that it [his injury] would happen again,\" Dr Turner told MEN Sport. \"That is just sensible. That is just the reality.",
      "\"What you wouldn’t want a player like that to do is delude themselves that this will never happen again and everything is always going to be hunky-dory because sport is so unpredictable, and there is so much uncertainty that you can never really predict what is going to happen.",
      "\"But having gone through two quite difficult injuries, he will have learnt quite a lot and his personality and character would have had some shifts. From my experience of working with athletes who have especially had these back-to-back injuries and even sometimes surgeries, they do develop a shift in their personality.",
      "\"I wouldn’t say it is necessarily more resilience, but there is clarity there of what this means to them. They suddenly have a gratitude and thinking of: ‘Well, this could go away at any minute, so I am going to apply myself doubly compared to what I was doing before. I am going to really take care of this and do all the right things.'\"",
      "\"You can’t put it to one side and say that is done now because there will be monitoring that takes place after training and after performances around that injury and around recovery to make sure that everything is going well.",
      "\"There will be physical limitations because it will have been a long time since they have played to the intensity of a proper game.",
      "\"So it is not just a case of putting it to the back of your mind but about trusting the medical professionals you are working with to know that they would not let you step on this pitch, if you wasn’t physically right. Players have to take confidence from that and trust the people they are working with and then they can trust their bodies.\"",
      "Martinez's teammate Bryan Mbeumo is currently negotiating a different type of mental challenge heading out of the international break. Last week, Cameroon lost to DR Congo in World Cup qualifying meaning Mbeumo's national team will not be competing in the USA, Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "Missing out on the World Cup, arguably the pinnacle of football, will have been a bitter blow for Mbeumo to take but Dr Turner believes that United do not have to fear the forward's confidence dropping upon his return to England.",
      "\"I am not sure they would have to do, or do anything special there,\" he explained. \"Experienced players are able to lift themselves, really, and move on quite quickly. One of the good things about football in particular is how quickly things move from game-to-game.",
      "\"Say you play badly and then you play well in the next game, it is sort of completely forgotten. Things move on so quickly so he would be expected to come back and hit the ground running and get his club mentality on.",
      "\"I think the direction of football, particularly in this country, is more of a club mentality and it is realised that is your bread and butter. I wouldn’t foresee any issues there and I wouldn’t expect staff to do anything in particular for that player.",
      "\"I might be wrong and I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, but from my experience of being in environments like that, it would be an expectation to get back on your feet and go again.",
      "\"The more that you make a big deal of something that has happened or bring it into the room, the more that is going to affect other players so you have got to get him back moving, playing and within the mentality of the squad.\"",

      "Earlier this month, Manchester United fans were left scratching their heads as one of their best players this season was snubbed again.",
      "Luke Shaw endured a tough start to the season, following on from a campaign ruined by injuries. The 2024/25 season did not go according to plan for anyone in red, but Shaw in particular was being doubted after another season spent mainly on the sidelines.",
      "However, full credit must go to Shaw for the manner in which he has bounced back.",
      "Following the disaster at Manchester City, Shaw has been dependable for the Reds this campaign in a back three. He had to deal with plenty of criticism following that derby day defeat - notably from Roy Keane - and after addressing it, he set about making amends.",
      "Ever since that game, Shaw has got better and better for United and you can see him settling into his new role on the left side of defence. That's why it was surprising when England head coach Thomas Tuchel overlooked him for the final World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "While being overlooked for selection will have been a blow to Shaw, Ruben Amorim will have taken the positives from the decision. He admitted himself, from a selfish perspective, he wanted all his players to be training and recovering at United during the international break. But he would still be delighted to see Shaw competing with England.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing,\" Amorim said earlier this season.",
      "While missing out on the November camp was a big blow for Shaw, Tuchel has admitted it is not necessarily the end of his World Cup dream. \"First of all, it's my job now to make contact with everyone,\" the England head coach said at the end of the Three Lions' final international break this year.",
      "\"Players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], players that are on our long list, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve.",
      "\"Can they even do something or is it just a choice, so this is my job in the next weeks and months.\"",
      "Shaw and Harry Maguire will be on Tuchel's list of 55-60 players who he is in contact with to discuss their spots in the England squad.",
      "That phone call should work to United's benefit. Shaw will know exactly what he needs to do over the next few months to put himself in contention and that can only help United.",
      "Shaw will be eager to show Tuchel that he was wrong to overlook him. The best way to do that will be to impress for Amorim and the Reds.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has admitted he is finding the five-at-the-back system under Ruben Amorim easier as time progresses.",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for his decision to stick with the five-at-the-back defence, with three centre-backs playing alongside two wing-backs. Some argued the Portuguese head coach needed to be pragmatic and revert to a traditional four-at-the-back system in order to secure results.",
      "Prior to the Burnley victory and with scrutiny mounting, the United boss told reporters: \"Guys, if I feel that it's best to change... I played all my life in the 4-4-2, 4-3-3. The only system that I didn't play one minute: 3-4-3.",
      "\"I just have one idea that we need to be so good in this way of playing, then we are going to adapt. It's like some coaches have a mentality that I'm going to put this system, and then I'm going to change.",
      "\"What I'm thinking is that we have one system that is going to adapt to different systems, and then when everyone is doing this with his eyes shut, I'm going to change a lot of things.\"",
      "United are on a five-game unbeaten run and sit a point outside the top four. Integral to this recent form has been De Ligt, who has started every Premier League match for Amorim this season.",
      "On Monday night, he played the full 90 minutes alongside Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk in a back four as the Netherlands beat Lithuania in their final World Cup qualifier to top their group. After the game, De Ligt was quizzed on his preference and the 26-year-old insisted that he does not have one.",
      "\"No, I don't really have a preference,\" he told Flashscore. \"We play with a five-man defence at Manchester United, but on paper, we defend with four.",
      "\"It didn't feel awkward today; it felt the same as always. I can play in both systems. I'm more experienced with a five-man defence now; the more experience you have, the easier it gets.\"",
      "In the last match before the November international break, you could see De Ligt's point in practice. United would often drop to a back four with Luke Shaw moving into central midfield.",
      "The Netherlands have now qualified for the World Cup and De Ligt expressed his delight post-match to have made his first start for his country since last November. \"Whether it's a comeback? Yeah, a bit,\" he admitted.",
      "\"I wasn't here last time, I haven't started for a long time, so I'm delighted with today. The season is going well so far.",
      "\"I'm not sure if you call it a comeback season, but I'm feeling well, and it's going better with the club, and now I'm rewarded with a start, so that's great.\"",
      "\"It's [the World Cup] still far away,\" De Ligt added. \"It'll be about being fit a lot, that's the most important thing to everyone.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "The Manchester United legend has a niche and it is carved out in cast-iron nonsense. And Mike Dean poured petrol on that particular dumpster fire earlier this week.",
      "“What was strange about it,” the former referee said on The Overlap, “is that once QPR found out they were safe, the game restarted and I think Jamie Mackie’s on the pitch, he’s going like that and celebrating while the game’s going on because they know they’re safe. They [Manchester City] make it 2-2 and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them.”",
      "And that much is true. Shaun Derry, who wore the captain’s armband for the final 40 minutes at the Etihad after a bout of generational headloss from Joey Barton, once said as such years later:",
      "“We kicked off and immediately knocked the ball into the far corner, as you would in rugby, trying to play for territory. Joe Hart came out and took a throw-in. I thought, ‘Why have we done that?’. It could have come back into me or into whoever in midfield and then back to defenders and into Paddy Kenny, and then you’ve taken 30 seconds off the clock.”",
      "But as chief kick-off culprit Jay Bothroyd added in the same Athletic article: “When I came on the pitch, Mark Bowen, Mark Hughes’ assistant, just said to me to try to hold it up, try and help us get up the pitch, and then once they scored, he was saying to me just kick the ball into the corner. Literally, kick the ball into the corner, get behind, get back to the halfway line and stay compact again.”",
      "If it was a grand scheme devised to undermine Manchester United then of course former Shimizu S-Pulse midfielder and Wales international Bowen was the mastermind.",
      "The reality was that a team facing the prospect of relegation for roughly 94 of the 95 minutes played, not far off half of which they had to play away from home against the best team in the league with 10 men because of Barton’s implosion, was simply exhausted.",
      "As with any decent conspiracy theory, there are salient points among the ruins of absurdity: the kick-off thing was weird; Djibril Cisse did celebrate with Samir Nasri – an old friend from their time together at Marseille – at the final whistle; and there were a handful of Manchester City alumni in the QPR side.",
      "Three, to be exact. The precise same number of former Manchester United players in the Sunderland team which dozed to a 1-0 defeat at the Stadium of Light 140 miles away, failing to muster a single shot from the 65th minute onwards.",
      "And Sir Alex Ferguson had an inside agent working for him in the QPR ranks. When Anton Ferdinand feels the need to reiterate four times in one sentence how he “was p*ssed off” at having cost his brother a Premier League title eight years after the fact, the idea that Manchester City benefited from a light dose of match-fixing starts to collapse in on itself.",
      "Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion, really ought to move on from the inability to make it a half-dozen. Not least because Manchester United lost the title on goal difference to a team which beat them 7-1 on aggregate that season, instigating one of the biggest yet most under-the-radar bottlings in history.",
      "But mainly because Rooney has unforgivably forced us into The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point territory with his incessant cry-arsing about actual Manchester United being screwed by a team rolling over for one of their rivals.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b*llocks,” Barton said in October. With Rooney seemingly dangerously close to labelling each of the above lizard people Illuminati members who sleep with 5G masts, it is a line he would do well to retire.",

      "The option of Ruben Neves – who played 177 times in the Premier League for Wolves – could be an intriguing one, as Amorim is known to be a fan of his, and United have been credited with interest in him.",
      "Neves is out of contract with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the summer, and therefore Caught Offside reports he’ll be available for €20million (£17.7m) in the winter.",

      "The report suggests that at the moment, a move to Turkey looks most likely for Neves, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in the mix.",
      "However, it is also suggested that if other top clubs don’t secure their favoured targets, there could be a lot of interest in Neves.",
      "A £17.1million price tag for a 28-year-old who starred during his time in England and has remained a fixture of the Portugal side since his move to Saudi would be a steal, though it’s not a surprise that the massive wages aren’t rousing many clubs.",
      "If United don’t see paying a big fee for any of the three Premier League midfielders they are tracking as plausible in the winter window, then they’re very unlikely to splash out on a huge contract instead.",
      "Neves would be a great signing in January if his wages were less of a strain, but they’d surely have to be significantly reduced, given the Red Devils’ highest wage is £350,000 per week, and that’s one of only two players who earn over £200,000 per week.",

      "They are also in reach of the top three, just two points from Chelsea in third, and four points from Manchester City, in second.",
      "Last term, when United finished 15th in the league, none of their players reached double figures for goals, and in 32 games, then-new signing Joshua Zirkzee scored just three goals.",

      "If he is not used, or only used sparingly, then ‘alarm bells’ are expected to start ringing. It would be an opportunity for United to test out what their attack could be like during AFCON.",

      "Manchester United are highly unlikely to be drawn into the transfer chase for Antoine Semenyo in January after two top sources outlined where Ruben Amorim’s priorities lie and with the Red Devils putting all their energies into another target instead.",
      "The Red Devils invested heavily into strengthening their attack this summer, spending well over £200m on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. And while the triple coup is starting to pay dividends, Manchester United could have added a different dimension to their attack had they instead opted to pursue Semenyo.",
      "Indeed, it has since emerged that United had a very serious interest in the 25-year-old Bournemouth star, with Amorim even meeting the player for dinner to discuss a prospective move.",
      "That’s according to transfer journalist, Duncan Castles, who claims Amorim met with the player to assess his personality and with the United boss ultimately informing club bosses he felt the player had what it takes to become a success at Old Trafford.",
      "That comes after David Ornstein had previously described the Portuguese as being “very fond” of the Bournemouth star.",
      "However, United’s unwillingness to pay more than £55m saw the deal collapse and ultimately saw the winger sign a new five-year deal with the Cherries.",
      "This week, though, it has emerged that Semenyo‘s deal contains a release clause worth just £60m, plus £5m in add-ons to prise him away from the Vitality Stadium and sparking something of a mad scramble for the Ghana international.",
      "And while sources have revealed it is Liverpool “ahead in the race”, the player continues to be linked with other sides, most notably Tottenham Hotspur and Man Utd.",
      "Despite that, both The Athletic and our own, Fraser Fletcher, are playing down the prospects of United rekindling a move for Semenyo in January, with the former describing a potential move to Old Trafford as ‘difficult’.",
      "Fletcher, meanwhile, insists while United still very much admire the player, their priorities in the January window and beyond lie elsewhere, with the club’s entire focus now shifted on upgrading their midfield and with three major targets the priority over the next two to three transfer windows…",
      "READ MORE 🔴⚫ Ruthless Man Utd planning £250m TRIPLE signing, with Bruno Fernandes at risk in midfield rebuild – Sources",
      "According to Castles, Amorim met Semenyo for dinner in a London restaurant to discuss a potential move north over the summer and prior to the player inking his extension at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "Castles told The Transfers Podcast: “They used the same strategy with Cunha and Mbeumo in that they agreed personal terms with Semenyo before attempting to agree a fee with Bournemouth.",
      "“They even had Amorim take him for a meal in London at the end of the season so Amorim could judge his character – again a similar process to Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "United’s prospects of signing Semenyo ultimately failed when he committed instead to the Cherries, though Castles also explains that United’s willingness to only pay the player 70% of the salaries offered to Mbeumo and Cunha also derailed the prospective deal.",
      "Furthermore, rival interest from Tottenham, coupled with United’s willingness to spend £62.5m to meet Cunha’s exit clause, meant the Cherries felt in a strong position to reject United’s approach and amid a suggestion they were not prepared to spend more than £55m on a player they rated at nearer the £70m bracket.",
      "While Semenyo was a player who ultimately slipped through their net, Castles is adamant he was a player they could have signed in addition to both Cunha and Mbeumo, if the price was right.",
      "And while the interest in the player remains, he is unlikely to be a priority for United, leaving his other suitors free to battle it out.",
      "Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has endorsed United’s pursuit of Elliot Anderson, but the Old Trafford legend wants Amorim to play the Nottingham Forest midfielder in a different role from what he is used to.",
      "On that new midfielder hunt, our transfer correspondent, Dean Jones, has revealed Crystal Palace’s stance around a mid-season sale of Adam Wharton, amid speculation that the Red Devils have already ‘submitted’ a ‘bid’ for the midfielder that Amorim ‘loves’.",
      "Elsewhere,  United have been confirmed as one of the clubs to have held talks with super-agent Jorge Mendes over a move to sign Borussia Dortmund attacker Karim Adeyemi next year, though sources have confirmed why the Germany star currently favours a move to Arsenal."

      "That has knocked Zirkzee down the pecking order at Old Trafford and there have been rumours that he could leave on loan in the January transfer window.",
      "An injury to Sesko appeared to rule that out but, with confirmation the Slovenian will be back in time for Christmas, it was thought that there could be hope if Zirkzee chose to leave Man Utd for more playing time ahead of the World Cup.",
      "But Romano is less sure that Zirkzee – who is yet to start a Premier League match this season – will be allowed to depart in January as Amorim “wants” him to stay.",
      "READ: Antoine Semenyo to Man Utd makes no sense until Amorim addresses biggest problem position",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “There was some fear at the very beginning after the [Tottenham] game about a potential serious injury. This is why Ruben Amorim, after the match, goes to the press conference and says, ‘Let’s see what happens with Sesko because maybe his injury could affect our plans for the January transfer window.’",
      "“Why? Because if it was going to be a very long injury, maybe three months, maybe four months, maybe six months, maybe an ACL. In that case, Man Utd had to sign a new striker in the January transfer window.",
      "“But I told you right after that my information was an injury – yes, a knee injury – but not a super serious injury, not a very long injury. And so good news for Man Utd.",
      "“But what I can tell you is that Sesko is expected to be out around three weeks. So the hope of the Man Utd staff is to have Sesko ready at the beginning of December. Then, it can take a few more days, also based on how he will recover, his physical condition, United will not take any risk.",
      "“But the expectation is for three, maximum four weeks, out for Sesko. So the hope is to have him available at the beginning of December. This could be important to understand also the future of Joshua Zirkzee because Zirkzee would be open to leaving Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "“Maybe go on loan, maybe have the opportunity to play on a regular basis, but at the same time, he remains an important player for Man Utd. Look, now there is the AFCON, and so some players are going, there is the injury of Sesko.",
      "“If you have injuries, if you have problems, whatever happens, you need another striker, and Zirkzee can be used as a No.9, as a N0.10 behind the strikers. So for Amorim, he’s an important player. Amorim wants Zirkzee to stay.”",
      "There were rumours that Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia was discussed as a potential makeweight during talks that saw Alejandro Garnacho leave Man Utd for Stamford Bridge in the summer.",
      "On those claims, Romano added: “My information is that Chelsea and Man Utd never ever discussed Romeo Lavia. According to my sources, Chelsea trust Lavia. Obviously, the boy is having several injuries, so Chelsea staff are doing their best to try to improve his physical condition.",
      "“They already did a fantastic job with Reece James, so the mission is to do the same now also with Lavia. But in terms of skills, in terms of development, in terms of potential, Chelsea believe in Lavia. Chelsea invested in Romeo Lavia because they are convinced he can be something special in the future.",
      "“And so Chelsea deny all this information of offering Lavia to Man Utd. The negotiation was only for Garnacho. I can reveal to you that at the beginning of the conversation, there was a possibility for Tyrique George to be involved in the deal with Man Utd.",
      "“But I’m talking about the beginning of June. That was a very early idea in the transfer window. Nothing happened with that one. And so it was a straight transfer for Garnacho to Chelsea, but Labia, not part of this swap deal conversation.”",
      "A Manchester United attacker is felt to have a ‘crucial opportunity’ coming soon, but there will be a point prior to that in which ‘alarm bells’ could begin to ring.",

      "“I think the win at Anfield has helped them massively. Because you can’t underestimate when you’re losing games and you’re getting done by Grimsby, and you’re getting beat by Brentford, it’s not great,” Hutchinson said in an interview with sportscasting.com.",

      "Former referee Mike Dean has backed claims from Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney conspiracy theory around Man City’s dramatic Premier League title win in 2012.",
      "The Red Devils were beaten to the Premier League title on the final day of the 2012 season despite their 1-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Man City were losing 2-1 at home to relegation-threatened QPR going into second-half stoppage time before Roberto Mancini’s side scored two goals in two minutes and five seconds to take the victory and the title.",
      "Man Utd legend Rooney has since voiced skepticism around Sergio Aguero’s late winner, while he criticised QPR’s players for “celebrating after the game with the City players”.",
      "Djibril Cisse hit back at those accusations from Rooney last month and insisted it was understandable that he celebrated with compatriot Samir Nasri as both teams had achieved something with QPR staying up.",
      "And now former Premier League referee Dean has questioned why the QPR players kicked the ball back to Man City after Edin Dzeko’s equaliser on 92 minutes.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "Dean told The Overlap Fan Debate: “They [City] make it 2-2, and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them. And we were like, ‘what’s going on, why are they giving the ball back straightaway?’ I said [that] in the ear piece.",
      "“To kick off and give the ball straight back to them. Neil Swarbrick, the fourth official, said, ‘keep switched on, something is going to happen.’ You just knew something was going to happen. You could just tell.",
      "“What was strange about it, once QPR found out they were safe, Jamie Mackie was on the pitch celebrating while the game was still going on.”",
      "Rooney chipped in: “They had loads of ex-City players in there as well.”",
      "The Man Utd legend’s claims have previously stirred something in former Man City and QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who didn’t hold back the swears for Rooney.",
      "On Rooney’s theory, Barton said: “At the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people’s results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",
      "“I have to disagree with Wayne. Wayne is trying to say that this game is some kind of bent fixture, that the lads had given up. He does say Paddy Kenny has basically thrown the two goals in that lead to City winning the league. I don’t think Paddy knew.",
      "“You might say Paddy should have done better with the goals, but I don’t think Paddy Kenny is the type of lad to throw a game to help Man City win the league.",
      "“So Wayne, and the other Man United fans – and I know loads of Man United fans have come up and asked me – no. I got told by Bobby Zamora to get someone sent off, so I tried. That’s where the book stops with me.",

      "“Your conspiracy theories, Wazza, are untrue. Sometimes people tell you stuff in life and you want to believe it because it fits your narrative and you want to have that cognitive dissonance.",
      "“It might be the same fellas who were saying that if you get one more hair transplant it might come back. This might be the time you get a fringe. As you found out, that is complete nonsense.",
      "“Stop wasting your time on nonsense. The game at Man City was not thrown. Man City won the league, Man United never. Am I happy about that? Abso-f***ing-lutely, because I hate Man United. But I didn’t go out my way to make City win the league.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b****cks.",
      "“You should have got yourselves in a better position. You didn’t. Man City had to beat QPR on the last day of the season at home, who were in the bottom four. That’s your fault.",
      "“The fact he’s even had a sniff of winning the league is a testament to the lads at QPR and the battle they put up, because that was an easy f***ing win for City.’",
      "Barton added: “QPR stayed up, happy days. City won the league, happy days. And you ****s were all crying on the pitch at the f***ing Stadium of f***ing Light or Middlesborough or wherever you was, which is f***ing triple whammy. Get f***ed.”",

      "Wayne Rooney is getting awfully comfortable with basically accusing QPR of colluding with Manchester City to deny Manchester United of the title in 2012.",
      "Jack Grealish “may as well book his holiday” as there is little chance England boss Thomas Tuchel selects him for the World Cup, according to Wayne Rooney.",

      "Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo may be a luxury signing, not a necessity, for Manchester United, but he can take them “to the next level”, says Bacary Sagna.",
      "Reports emerged on Monday that Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, sparking rumours of a departure in the January transfer window.",
      "Manchester United and Liverpool are among those being linked with the Ghanaian international, with the latter eyeing a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly leading the race for Semenyo, with a January transfer not being ruled out.",
      "Manchester United are among the clubs being linked with the Bournemouth star, and former Arsenal, Manchester City and France right-back Sagna thinks he could take Ruben Amorim’s team to another level.",
      "“Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,” he told Oddspedia.",
      "“He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he’d be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "“He’s young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season – so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.”",
      "Sagna added: “If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season.",
      "“As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it’s much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly – rather than joining midway through a campaign.”",
      "Semenyo is a fantastic player, but it’s probably worth seeing if Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha can continue to improve United before they spend big on another Premier League forward.",
      "Amorim’s frontline was completely revamped in the summer transfer window with the signings of Cunha, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for over £200million.",
      "Not only are those three players shiny new investments, but the Red Devils have bigger priorities in the transfer market, namely a new central midfielder.",
      "Suppose United are convinced that recruiting from lesser Premier League clubs like Wolves, Brentford and Bournemouth is the way to go, they won’t look further than Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton in their pursuit of a new midfielder.",
      "Sure, Semenyo would improve the United squad, but Amorim also has Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Obviously, £65m should be invested elsewhere.",
      "While we aren’t convinced by the financial practicality of United signing Semenyo, we are convinced that Semenyo to Liverpool is a transfer that makes perfect sense.",
      "The Premier League champions also spent big on their attack in the summer, signing Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak for over £200m, while attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz joined for £100m.",
      "However, there is an alarming lack of depth behind Mohamed Salah on the right, with right-back Jeremie Frimpong seemingly second in Arne Slot’s pecking order.",
      "Not only is there no serious competition for Salah, but Liverpool need a long-term replacement for the 33-year-old.",
      "No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked in favour of Liverpool recruiting a serious downgrade on Salah, because he’s played at an all-time level for the Reds.",
      "The best option is arguably Michael Olise, Bayern Munich’s world-class winger, but even he would be a downgrade on the Salah we saw last season. Unfortunately for Liverpool, they can’t replace the best Premier League winger of all time with someone capable of making the same impact.",
      "So, Semenyo shouldn’t be viewed as an underwhelming replacement, and he probably isn’t, having scored six goals in 12 Premier League matches this term.",
      "Despite record-breaking summer expenditure from Liverpool, they still have money to spend, and they’d be wise to invest their funds into the signing of Semenyo, but only if they sign a centre-back first, in what would likely be a £100m total investment, unlike Man United’s £165m spend on the Bournemouth man and a midfielder like Anderson or Baleba.",

      "Man Utd are keeping a close eye on Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo and Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi ahead of January, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal already have a near-complete squad, but they would be in an even stronger position if these five deals happen in a perfect January window for the Gunners…",

      "Man Utd have been warned by Red Devils legend Dwight Yorke not to sign Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton as they look for a new midfielder.",
      "The recruitment team at Man Utd were criticised over the summer transfer window for not bringing in a new midfielder despite spending over £200m on five new signings.",
      "It was one of the weakest areas in Ruben Amorim’s side last year and early on this season it was once again an issue as Man Utd remained inconsistent.",
      "The Red Devils have been much better in recent weeks with Man Utd currently five unbeaten after Amorim’s side won their first back-to-back Premier League matches under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Man Utd are still looking for midfield reinforcements, though, with rumours that they could make a new signing in that position over the January transfer window.",

      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "Yorke told Snabbare: “I’m not sure Adam Wharton is the answer. He’s still not quite there for me yet and that’s an area of concern we have to look to improve.",
      "“It is a gap in this Manchester United team. You look at the history behind the football club in its most successful years and they always had a fantastic number six in that position.”",
      "Yorke insists that their new midfield sign must be capable of dictating the pace of a game but it will be “a tough gig” to find the right players.",
      "He added: “Casemiro has been hit and miss at times and it’s a key part of your team. You listen to all the great managers, that central area of your midfield is always so important.",
      "“It’s a tough gig that one to find the right players and I think that’s why they’re struggling. They haven’t got that player who can set the floor of the game, as I always call it, and dictate the pace, who defends but passes the ball forwards, and can see the pass.",
      "“These types of players are rare which surprises me as on the face of it it’s not the most difficult job in the world but it’s the most crucial.”",
      "Yorke continued: “Who I would like to see in that position more? I can’t think, honestly, because there’s too much hype around some of these players,’ he continued.",
      "“Bring back Michael Carrick, maybe? There we go. He’d have done a job in this team!”",
      "When asked if he’d been impacted by the links to Man Utd and other teams, Wharton recently told The Athletic: “Not really, to be honest. I don’t really look into it or think too much about it.",
      "“There’s always rumours floating about on social media and things like this. Is it true? Is it not true? You tell me!”",
      "“Honestly, I get my friends all messaging me or my family, my brothers. Everyone will message me and they’ll be like, “Oh, is this true? This club is interested.”",
      "“I’m like, “Thanks for telling me because I didn’t know before you told me!” and I don’t really take an interest to it too much. I don’t really think about it.",
      "“If something is going to be serious, then I can maybe think about it. But if it’s not very serious, if there’s interest, I’m not interested in knowing because interest… you can be interested in anything and nothing can come from it… I don’t really read into it too much.",
      "“I see it and I’m like, ‘Okay,’ and just carry on with my day. United, the big teams, they’re all linked to 10-20 players. If I’m one in 20, it’s nothing special. It doesn’t really mean too much.",

      "Thursday 20 November 2025 15:12, UK",
      "Which Premier League teams are overachieving and underachieving this season? And will Arsenal be caught?",
      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",
      "Newcastle and newly-promoted Leeds are also underperforming significantly. They sit sixth and seventh in the expected table, eight and nine places better off respectively.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face Everton on Monday Night Football on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League but the expected table has them three places worse off in 10th, suggesting their performances haven't been as good as recent results suggest.",
      "One team conspicuous by its absence from the top half of the expected table is Sunderland.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",
      "Crystal Palace are also predicted to clinch a European finish in sixth, along with Spurs, who sit a place below the Eagles in seventh. Sunderland are ninth, with Aston Villa only just squeezing into the top half in 10th.",
      "While Newcastle fans are hopeful their team's form will recover following a poor start, the predicted table has them 14th, which would be their lowest finish since being relegated in 2015/16.",
      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",
      "That means Leeds, as well as Sunderland, are predicted to survive, with Burnley the only promoted team expected to go straight down.",
      "Nottingham Forest, currently second from bottom having appointed their third manager of the season in Sean Dyche, are expected to fight their way out of trouble and finish 16th.",
      "Have Liverpool lost their physical edge? Last week we revealed the alarming numbers behind their out-of-possession drop-off.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "A number of Premier League stars have entered the final year of their contracts, meaning they can negotiate a free transfer with clubs outside of England from January.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",
      "Talks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.",
      "Rico Henry",
      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",
      "He was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.",
      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",
      "He missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.",
      "James Milner",
      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",
      "Hurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.",
      "Martin Dubravka",
      "Dubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.",
      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",
      "Barnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.",
      "He then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.",
      "Marc Guehi",
      "Arguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.",
      "Rumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.",
      "Daichi Kamada",
      "Informal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.",
      "Naouirou Ahamada",
      "The 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.",
      "Nathaniel Clyne",
      "In his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.",
      "Clyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.",
      "Jefferson Lerma",
      "Lerma is a useful and reliable option for Oliver Glasner to turn to, especially as he looks to balance fixture congestion in domestic cup competitions and Europe.",
      "The Eagles hold an option to extend his stay at Selhurst Park for an additional year.",
      "Vitaliy Mykolenko",
      "Mykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.",
      "James Garner",
      "Garner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.",
      "Michael Keane",
      "Another mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.",
      "Keane, 32, reportedly has an option to extend his stay for an additional 12 months.",
      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",
      "He has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.",
      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",
      "Despite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
      "Freddie Woodman",
      "Woodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.",
      "In the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.",
      "Rhys Williams",
      "Even with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.",
      "Bernardo Silva",
      "Silva spoke openly about his future during the summer, outlining he is focused on the season but is aware he can leave the Etihad Stadium next summer.",
      "He continues to play a crucial role for Pep Guardiola's side and had options to leave but remained at the club.",
      "John Stones",
      "The future of John Stones is yet to be decided, with the England centre-back also approaching the end of his current deal.",
      "Stefan Ortega",
      "Ortega is now third-choice at the club following the arrivals of Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford. The German shot-stopper was linked as a potential target for Burnley in the summer.",
      "Marcus Bettinelli",
      "Signed in the summer before Trafford and Donnarumma arrived at the Etihad, Bettinelli is yet to make his debut for the club.",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "One of the more notable names approaching free agency. Maguire has enjoyed an upturn in his career at Old Trafford over the last two seasons.",
      "Maguire is not a regular starter under Ruben Amorim but adds crucial depth and experience. A one-year extension in his deal was triggered in January.",
      "Casemiro",
      "The club hold an option to extend Casemiro's stay by an additional year but there is a real possibility his contract is not renewed to free up space on the wage bill to strengthen the midfield area next season.",
      "Tom Heaton",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper behind Senne Lammens and Altay Bayindir at the club. Heaton has not featured for United since the 2022/23 season and will be 40 when his contract expires.",
      "Fabian Schar",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Casemiro is in the final year of his Manchester United contract, 33 years old and it's fair to admit he's also past his pomp, but he is a crucial cog in Ruben Amorim's midfield.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, five have come when Casemiro was on the pitch. The other 15 goals they've shipped have come without him. That pattern was clear in United's 2-2 draw at Spurs.",
      "Casemiro was taken off with less than 20 minutes to go and United leading through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header. Spurs then scored twice late on when he left the field.",
      "Casemiro has an undeniable impact on United but Amorim's over-reliance on the Brazil international is a further reflection of the club's need to find an appropriate heir in midfield. United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",
      "However, Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser extended Spurs' winless home run in the competition to five.",
      "In spite of these struggles, and a raft of injuries with 10 players out, Spurs are still third in the table. Sorting those home struggles is crucial if Spurs are to be contenders.Zinny Boswell",
      "Good things can't last forever, and in the case of Arsenal, their run of clean sheets came to its conclusion at the Stadium of Light.",
      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",
      "Had another clean sheet been secured, this wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. But, ultimately, this would be costly.",
      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",
      "Admittedly, in the second half, the Black Cats were at the mercy of Arsenal, who looked likely to score with almost every attack. In the first, though, it was a very different tale.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side put in a commanding first 45 minutes. And it wasn't by playing the most beautiful football. It was by forcing their opponents to play the game exactly how they wanted it to be played.",
      "The resolute nature of Sunderland's rearguard performance began to irritate the Gunners, and by the time they conceded they were just playing into the hands of the hosts. Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",
      "When people say there are no easy games in the Premier League, Sunderland are the evidence they will continue to point towards.Callum Bishop",
      "Booed off at half-time, given a standing ovation at the final whistle. There was a big mood-shift at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea eventually broken down and then tore apart Wolves.",
      "The Chelsea supporters had been celebrating before kick-off, too, watching Arsenal get pegged back by Sunderland on the TV screens inside the stadium. Those two results, leave Chelsea second in the Premier League title race and just six points off the Gunners.",
      "Are the world champions now Premier League contenders?",
      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",
      "After this third international break of the season, the hard and decisive winter months begin. Chelsea are well placed - just as they were at this stage last season. Can they kick on and go for the crown?Peter Smith",
      "Former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil says the club needs a \"reset\". To stay in the Premier League they'll need a miracle.",
      "Every single top-flight side with two or fewer points at this stage have then been relegated - Man City in 1995-96 (2), Sunderland in 2016-17 (2), Sheffield United in 2020-21 (1) and 2023-24 (1), and Norwich in 2021-22 (2).",
      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",
      "Even in 20 years time, Tomas Soucek will be scoring goals for West Ham in the Premier League. Probably.",
      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton’s midfield set the tone from the first whistle, with Idrissa Gana Gueye driving the team forward and capping a dominant first half with the opener. His energy and control allowed the Toffees to dictate the tempo and keep Fulham penned in for long spells.",
      "Michael Keane’s late header sealed the points and reflected Everton’s growing confidence under David Moyes. The defender looked assured at the back and dangerous from set-pieces, delivering one of his most complete performances of the season.",
      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",
