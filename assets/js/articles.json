      "Michael Owen believes Manchester United should be pulling out all the stops to sign Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian goalkeeper has impressed with Paris Saint-Germain over the last four years, but it appears as though his stint in the French capital is drawing to a close.",
      "Donnarumma has entered the final year of his contract at the Parc des Princes and is on the hunt for a new club after Les Parisiens enlisted the help of Lucas Chevalier and deemed him surplus to requirements. Ruben Amorim has had a largely successful maiden summer transfer window with the Red Devils, bringing in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"I mean, he is unbelievable. He's literally one of, if not the best goalkeeper in the world. I mean, he would be the obvious one, but whether they can get him or not is another matter.\"",
      "At present, United have been forced to deploy Altay Bayindir between the sticks as a result of first-choice keeper, Andre Onana, recovering from injury and lacking match sharpness. However, many fans will believe that the club need to replace Onana permanently if they hope to improve on last season's dismal 15th-place Premier League finish.",
      "The Cameroonian has failed to live up to his £47.2million price tag since arriving at Old Trafford from Inter Milan two years ago, and has been lambasted for making a number of high-profile mistakes. While Donnarumma is a viable option at present, given that PSG are reportedly only asking for £40m for the 26-year-old, United will face stiff competition in getting a deal over the line.",
      "Local rivals Manchester City are currently at risk of losing Ederson to Galatasaray, and despite snapping up James Trafford in a £27m move earlier this summer, the youngster may need a little more time to develop before he is a solidified starter.",
      "As a result, the Cityzens are said to be interested in bringing Donnarumma to the Etihad Stadium ahead of deadline day, and talks are said to have commenced with the European champions. However, a reluctance to pay PSG's asking price could leave the door open to a hijacking of the keeper by their neighbours.",
      "With a quartet of Ligue 1 titles, five domestic cups and a Champions League to his name in the French capital, Donnarumma would likely walk straight into the starting XI under Pep Guardiola or Amorim. He also conceded just 25 goals in the league last season and kept five clean sheets.",
      "However, Owen has also highlighted other areas in which United would be wise to focus on improving should they have any hopes of working their way back to dominance in the Premier League. He added: \"Well, I mean, there are areas where they could strengthen.",
      "\"If they want to go and be a top team again and challenge for the league, then there's loads of areas. But just to get back into that sort of European places, then they've probably got a strong enough squad.",
      "\"The goalkeeper looks quite an obvious one that they might need to change at some point. They've not done much surgery to their team apart from right up at the top of the field. So, you know, they've got one or two ageing players in midfield that are going to need changing in time.",
      "\"They've got a lot of defenders at the moment, whether they've got many great ones is a question mark. But I think over time they're going to need to change a fair few players, but just to get them back up in fifth, sixth place type of thing this season, I think they've got more than enough to do that.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Brandon Williams has insisted he has \"learned from his mistakes\" following his suspended jail sentence for a car crash at 99mph as he looks to rebuild his once promising career at Hull City.",
      "Williams was involved in the collision in August 2023 and was charged with dangerous driving and driving without insurance, pleading guilty to both charges.",
      "He was disqualified from driving last year and handed a 14-month jail term earlier this summer, which was suspended for two years.",
      "Williams, now 24, has not played since December 2023 during a loan spell with Ipswich Town and was released by boyhood club United last year.",
      "But now Hull have given Williams a chance to bounce back by giving him a one-year deal and he is eager to make amends - admitting he was \"not in a good place\".",
      "\"It was in the moment I was in, I wasn't in a good place,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside. \"It's a big regret and I've learned from my mistakes. I was still a young boy and I'm grown up now. My focus is back on football and that's all I want to do now.",
      "\"I took action to step away from the game but I feel like I managed it well. I was working in silence. Everyone was questioning what I was doing but I was working the whole time. I was keeping fit and making sure I was ready to step back into football. It was always the aim.\"",
      "Williams said he had \"honest\" meetings with Hull boss Sergej Jakirovic about what it would take to get him back to full fitness after so long out of the game as he opened up on his struggles away while taking a break from football.",
      "\"I had a couple of very honest meetings with the manager,\" he added. \"We know it's going to be a process to get fully back up to speed, having that time out. I appreciated the manager's honesty. Now, it's down to me to work hard and get as many games as I can.",
      "\"It was very difficult (taking a break from football) – mentally and physically. It's been a long road back, but probably something I needed. Now, I'm back here a different person.",
      "\"I've grown up a lot and I'm ready to just focus on the football. I've missed it. I'm hungry, I'm fiery. I know what quality I can bring to the team. As soon as I get back to that, I'm sure I'll be an asset to the team.",
      "\"Now, I've got to show it to the fans and my teammates to prove I'm here to work hard and help the team get results.\"",
      "Williams joined United as a seven-year-old and went on to play 51 times for the Red Devils and was initially loaned to Norwich - where he played 26 times in the Premier League in 2021-22. But he had less success with Ipswich in the Championship in 2022 before his legal troubles began.",

      "He announced at the end of last season that he would be stepping aside from his commitments to the broadcaster but maintains his own successful podcast business.",
      "“There’s not one reason,” he told The National. “I went for the Global Soccer Awards at Christmas and I hadn’t been there properly for about seven or eight years. We spent time with some of Kate’s friends who live there and I just saw a different side to it. I also have a business out there, Football Escapes.”",

      "“When I made the decision, I thought, ‘this must be 30 years when my life has been driven by the fixture list. Not now.’ I’m not leaving football, but it’s just not the governing body of my life now. I’ve got to be honest, it feels nice.",
      "“The education system felt different, felt better for my kids. The children who are coming are 14, which is perfect because it’s their two years of GCSEs starting this August. Then we’ve got a four and a two-year-old, so it’s perfect timing for them as well.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe could find himself in a position where he needs to sell his stake in Manchester United and be able to do nothing about it. That is after a clause in the deal that saw him invest in the Red Devils became active little over a week ago.",
      "The INEOS chief paid £1.3billion for 25 per cent of United in February 2024 and has since set about overhauling the setup. Ratcliffe has overseen redundancies, a change in the club's sporting hierarchy and attempted to set a platform for success even as the team finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "But as of August 13, a 'drag-along right' became active, per Mail+. And that means if the Glazers ever want to sell up at Old Trafford, that could see Ratcliffe join them with INEOS having little say in the matter.",
      "Such clauses exist to enable a company to be sold, by preventing circumstances where a minority shareholder can block a deal, when the majority want it to pass. In this instance, the clause came into effect 18 months after Ratcliffe made his investment and ensured that the Glazers are somewhat in control of the billionaire's stake too.",
      "It is something Ratcliffe is keenly aware of, and even appeared to allude to upon the announcement of his investment. \"I don't think we're going to be taking the legal agreements out of the bottom drawer,\" he said.",
      "\"I just hope they gather dust and we never see them. Which it should be. It should be on the basis of a relationship.\"",
      "For the moment, there appears to be little intention of cashing in on the club. The parties would seem to have a good relationship and there is said to be an acknowledgement from the majority owners that INEOS have carried out the dirty work in restructuring the club and taken some of the heat off of the Glazers, while also taking charge of footballing matters.",
      "For his part, Ratcliffe has spoken highly of his partners. In March he said: \"To be fair to the Glazers, they’re really good on the commercial side.",
      "\"The people who advise me say the fans don’t want to hear it. So I’ve got to be cautious. I get a lot of criticism if I support the Glazers, but the fact is they’re really decent people.",
      "\"They’re East Coast, you know — that old East Coast America, they’re very polite, they’re very civilized, they’re the nicest people on the planet. I mean, there isn’t a bad bone in Joel Glazer’s body.\"",
      "Instead he directed criticism at previous club chiefs, and said: \"I wouldn’t have tolerated Ed Woodward, or Richard Arnold.\"",
      "For now, it appears the most likely prospective buyer is not interested in taking advantage of the Glazer's clause coming into play. Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani attempted to buy the club before Ratcliffe's bid for a stake was successful.",
      "Sheikh Jassim the 92 Foundation are said to have 'zero interest' in returning at the moment, despite being aware of the situation.",

I can confirm I have now handed in a formal transfer request.\"",
      "Atalanta CEO Luca Percassi recently opened up on the situation and claimed that the club would be happy to sell - but only for their price and not to a direct rival. He said: “It’s a good opportunity to clarify what happened. Last year, after a 20 million offer from PSG, the player had asked us to be sold.",
      "“Atalanta, being a credible club, had promised to sell the player this window based on two conditions that he himself had asked of us: First, to go to a super, top European club, and that he would never be seen in Italy wearing a shirt other than Atalanta’s, given what he did for the club and what he received from the club.",

      "Manchester United have been dealt a blow in their efforts to cash in on Rasmus Hojlund this summer. Danish striker Hojlund has been a target for AC Milan, with United hoping for a chunky transfer fee, but the Rossoneri have moved onto another target.",
      "Curiously, former United boss Erik ten Hag has played a part. Milan are closing in on Nigerian striker Victor Boniface, who has spent the last two years at a Bayer Leverkusen side who now have Ten Hag in the dugout.",
      "According to BBC Sport, Milan are set to bring in the 24-year-old on loan, with an option to make the move permanent. Reports elsewhere put the option at around £26m - significantly less than United's asking price for Hojlund.",

      "There is no word on whether Leverkusen themselves will enter the striker market after allowing Boniface to leave. However, last season top scorer Patrick Schick will continue to lead the line, while Martin Terrier is expected to return to action in the autumn after a serious achilles injury.",

      "Carlos Baleba's contract is believed to contain a sell-on clause that could potentially sting Manchester United. The Red Devils have made their interest in the Brighton and Hove Albion star known this summer.",
      "That's despite the Seagulls' insistence that their gifted midfielder isn't available, while they've also attached whacked a hefty price tag on him of around £100million. As a result, United bosses have reportedly conceded that a move before September 1 is now highly unlikely, and they already have an eye on next year.",
      "However, future attempts to secure the Cameroonian at Old Trafford could be hampered by a sell-on clause, as reported by Fabrizio Romano. It's claimed that Baleba's current deal includes a provision that 15 per cent of any sale from Brighton will go to Lille.",
      "Brighton were said to have agreed the clause with the Ligue 1 team when the two clubs negotiated a deal worth around £26m two years ago. This could shed light on Brighton's steep valuation of Baleba and their firm position in discussions about a sale.",
      "The Seagulls have a specific amount in mind they want to receive to let the young player leave the Amex Stadium, considering a portion of it will go to his former club. Theoretically, without the contract clause, United might have been looking at an £85m asking price for Baleba, as Brighton wouldn't be losing £15m of their £100m valuation to Lille in that scenario.",
      "Selling players would certainly ease the PSR pressure on the Red Devils. And while there's still hope that a deal can be struck to offload Alejandro Garnacho, with Chelsea reportedly closing in on the winger, other surplus players like Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony seem to be stuck in limbo.",
      "United have managed to cut around £12million from their wage bill after Marcus Rashford agreed to a year-long loan to Barcelona with an option to buy, although the club were hopeful of finding a permanent home for the academy graduate, who has fallen out of favour with Amorim.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund's future is uncertain following the arrival of Sesko from RB Leipzig in a £73.7m deal earlier this month. Despite being linked with loan moves to Napoli and AC Milan, the Dane is determined to stay in the north west and fight for his place in the new season.",
      "Amorim struggled last season with his ageing midfield, including Casemiro and Christian Eriksen, but it's not just the middle of the pitch that needs bolstering before the transfer deadline.",
      "Andre Onana, who cost a hefty £47.2m from Inter Milan in 2023, has failed to justify his price tag, making several costly errors in the Premier League despite being touted as one of the world's top goalkeepers.",
      "The Cameroonian has only just returned from a hamstring injury, leading to Altay Bayindir stepping in as Amorim's chosen keeper for United's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday. After United's 1-0 defeat, it remains to be seen whether they will make a last-minute bid for a new No. 1 before the transfer window closes.",

Isak isn't the first, and won't be the last, major name to decide he's had enough. Only to realise playing for the club he was desperate to leave is his only hope.",
      "Some regard Luis Suarez's efforts in 2013/14 as the best single season by a player in Premier League history. He scored 31 times in 33 games as he almost hauled Liverpool to their first title in decades. He picked up numerous individual accolades whilst doing so.",
      "But that summer it looked as if his time at Anfield was over as he publicly called out the club, demanding they sell him so that he could play in the Champions League. Liverpool had missed out on the top four and the Uruguayan seemingly didn't want to stick around with Arsenal circling.",
      "He said: \"I gave absolutely everything last season. Now all I want is for Liverpool to honour our agreement.\" Suarez went on to say: \"I am 26, I need to be playing in the Champions League. I feel I have done enough to be playing in the Champions League at this stage of my career.\"",
      "Four months later and, in the midst of an astonishing individual season, he signed a new long-term deal to become a top earner at Liverpool. Yes he would leave for Barcelona soon after, but his performances would win back over the red folk on Merseyside.",
      "Another man who won over those wearing red was one Wayne Rooney. He took on Sir Alex Ferguson, having been frustrated by the lack of ambition being shown by Manchester United in the transfer market. He wanted to know who was going to be signed and when.",
      "Rooney had seen Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo leave and was left firmly as the main man at Old Trafford. He spoke with major individuals at the club but they \"did not give me any of the assurances I was seeking about the future squad\" as Rooney made it clear he wouldn't sign a new deal back in 2010.",
      "Ferguson was frustrated by the matter and the Evertonian had to sit out whilst the initial anger came, which only amplified with talk of a move to Manchester City.",
      "48 hours later though and all was well. Rooney signed a new deal and vowed to do whatever he could to get the fans back onside. He said: \"Some fans may not take to me again very quickly. It may take time. But I will give everything. I will give 100 per cent and try to build that relationship back.\"",
      "That February Rooney would score a stunning overhead kick to down United's Manchester rivals - a goal that Ferguson would declare as the greatest he'd ever seen in his time at the club. The forward would spend another seven years at Old Trafford en route to becoming their all-time leading goalscorer.",
      "Another man heavily linked with City was Harry Kane, this back in the summer of 2021. Fresh from his efforts with England in the Euros, the Tottenham striker knew a rebuild was on the cards in north London. He was at the peak of his powers and still without a trophy.",
      "The champions were in the market for a new striker and wanted the England captain. He left Tottenham fans furious when in an interview with Gary Neville he put his own valuation on his head and suggested that him leaving would suit him and his club - which the latter clearly didn't agree with.",
      "Tottenham stood firm and refused to sell Kane, who had to sit out of the opening games as the noise around his future continued. In a similar situation to Isak, Kane felt an agreement was in place to let him leave and frustration mounted when he wasn't allowed to depart.",
      "Kane would cop boos from some Tottenham fans as he reintegrated himself into the team, albeit his performances were not always at the desired level. The striker is often referred to as \"one of our own\" in a song sung by the home crowd in Tottenham and he would enjoy his moment in the sun soon enough.",
      "He scored a brace to down City on his first meeting against them following his transfer saga. The following season and a winning goal against the same Manchester outfit would officially see him become the club's all-time record goalscorer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The opening weekend of Premier League matches has given plenty of teams a wake-up call when it comes to summer transfers. And now, as all 20 sides prepare to return to action, work is being done to get those last few deals over the line.",
      "Eberechi Eze has been a man in demand all summer, and the expiry of his release clause hasn't changed that one bit. Tottenham had looked to be in pole position to sign the England international but Arsenal have now stolen a march.",
      "Reigning champions Liverpool have been among the busiest in the league, but they might not be done. Alexander Isak's statement on Tuesday night could accelerate a move to Anfield for the Newcastle star, while a move for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi remains possible.",
      "Unlike Liverpool and Arsenal, Manchester United made a losing start to the campaign. A new central midfielder could be on the cards, even if Carlos Baleba is out of their price range, while they could also rival Manchester City for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has revealed he had interest in him this summer but opted to stay after admitting it would have been \"silly\" to leave Ruben Amorim's project.",
      "United activated an extension in his contract at the start of the year and Maguire has insisted he wasn't interested in clubs who made approaches for him in this window.",
      "“Last year was the clause in their hands so there was no option for me there,” he said. “There was no talking. It was just they activated it and it got extended.",
      "“This year, obviously I’m up at the end of the year. I’m pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can’t leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract. Yes. I think there was a couple of clubs who maybe enquired or spoke with them and I think they got a quick response.",
      "“We’re in a good place, positive as a club and I feel like the hierarchy has come in and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the manager, I feel like they’re taking it in the right direction.\"",
      "Fabian Hurzeler kept his cards close to his chest when asked about Julio Enciso's impending move to Strasbourg.",
      "“There are some rumours, there are some talks, but nothing is done yet so we can’t comment on that,” the Brighton boss told reporters.",
      "“I wouldn’t say it didn’t work. Some players perform better in some environments. Some players struggle with some cultural things. But overall I wouldn’t say it was a bad time if he were to leave.\"",

      "The Monaco talent is next on their list after missing out on Eberechi Eze and balking at Manchester City's asking price for Savinho, according to The Independent.",
      "Akliouche, who Monaco value at a reported £47.5m, was part of the France squad which won silver at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.",
      "Jadon Sancho is set to reject a move to Roma in favour of alternative options.",
      "The Manchester United winger doesn't appear to have any future at Old Trafford, but it sounds like he won't move to the Italian capital either.",
      "Chelsea have already passed up on an opportunity to sign the former Dortmund star, paying United to get out of an obligation to buy after an up-and-down loan spell.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis claims he wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres in the summer of 2024 but was hamstrung by a promise made to Antonio Conte that he would keep Khvicha Kvaratskhelia rather than selling the Georgian to raise funds.",
      "\"PSG had offered over 200m for the Kvara and Osimhen package,\" De Laurentiis told Italian media.",
      "“However, I had promised Conte I would keep, and I didn’t feel like going back on my word. With those funds, the idea was to buy Gyokeres.”",
      "Kvaratskhelia only ended up staying until January, when he did complete that PSG move. Conte ended up signing Romelu Lukaku rather than Gyokeres, and his 14 goals helped Napoli pip Inter Milan to the title.",
      "Oriol Romeu is set to leave Barcelona after an agreement was reached to terminate his contract, according to Marca (via Football Espana).",
      "The former Chelsea and Southampton star rejoined Barca in 2023, having come through their academy as a teenager.",

      "Newcastle have yet to get a deal over the line for Yoane Wissa as they look to strengthen up front.",
      "A £40m bid was knocked back by Brentford on Wednesday, with reports earlier in the week suggesting the Bees were holding out for £60m.",
      "It remains to be seen what this means for Alexander Isak's Newcastle future, with the Magpies likely to want two new faces in attack if they are to part with last season's top scorer.",
      "Eberechi Eze is expected to undergo his Arsenal medical on Friday.",

      "Ruben Amorim didn’t do enough to convince Manchester United to sign Emiliano Martinez over the summer, it has been claimed. Despite an encouraging performance in Sunday’s defeat to Arsenal, United have something of a keeper crisis.",
      "Andre Onana has made a catalogue of errors since his arrival from Ajax two years ago, while Altay Bayindir has failed to convince in his fleeting appearances and was at fault for the Gunners’ goal when he flapped at a corner.",
      "It’s been clear for some time that United need a new stopper and Amorim is a big fan of Martinez, 32, who has played a key role in Aston Villa’s success under Unai Emery. Despite signing a new contract last year, the Argentine looked set to leave Villa after appearing to say an emotional goodbye to fans at the end of last season.",
      "At the time, Emery was non-committal over Martinez’s future, merely saying “we will see”. That appeared to leave the door open for a raid from United, who could have landed the World Cup winner for a fee of around £40million.",
      "However, United have reportedly seen an approach to sign Martinez on loan rejected by Villa. Amorim’s plea to sign the player outright was not supported by the United board, which has instead backed the head coach with attacking signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Argentine outlet TyC Sports reports that a deal to bring Martinez to Old Trafford was 'very close'. They added that Amorim 'could not convince' the board to splash out on a keeper with Onana still on the books and would only sanction a loan move. Villa, meanwhile, had agreed to let Martinez go, but for only for the right price.",
      "While United appear to have made strides following their shambolic 2024/25 campaign, which produced the club’s lowest league finish in half a century, their goalkeeping issues could undermine their progress. Following the Arsenal defeat, Amorim jumped to the defence of Bayindir, suggesting he could keep his place for Sunday’s game at Fulham.",
      "Amorim said of the Gunners’ goal: “You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way, the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.",
      "“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed, so he cannot defend it.\"",
      "Last season, Bayindir conceded directly from a Son Heung-min corner in a 4-3 Carabao Cup defeat at Tottenham, but Amorim rejected criticism of the Turkey international when asked if he had considered starting third-choice Tom Heaton against a team renowned for their threat from corners.",
      "Amorim added: “He suffered a goal like this, where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul.",
      "“Then, in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don’t remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay. I am happy with the three goalkeepers.”",

      "When asked in his post-Arsenal press conference if he should have selected veteran shot-stopper Tom Heaton, who shone during the summer friendlies, instead of Bayindir, Amorim became rather defensive. However, that's exactly what ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster believes the Portuguese head coach should do for their next game at Fulham this Sunday.",
      "That is despite the fact that the 39-year-old former Burnley star hasn't played in the Premier League since the beginning of 2020.",
      "While Foster thinks Heaton would be the most suitable short-term option, he has reiterated his recent call for United to sign either Emiliano Martinez or Gianlugii Donnarumma before the summer transfer window closes in less than two weeks or risk another disappointing season.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"This is a massive problem for the next game. It asks all sorts of questions and there's going to be so much talk surrounding it coming into that next game.",
      "\"Do you start with Bayindir, whose confidence will be low now after the first game? With Onana, people will be going, 'Well, he's not much better.' There's a lot of pressure. Tom Heaton, I would trust him to give me a six-and-a-half out of 10 performance.",
      "\"It just forces Man United's hand to go and sign a proper goalkeeper. I think if you can get a Martinez or a Donnarumma, you've just got to do it. If you sign that player, it's going to be the difference between mid-table misery or really pushing for that top six.\"",
      "Despite the goalkeeping crisis at United, Amorim seemed satisfied with his current options when questioned about the situation after the Arsenal match.",
      "Amorim said: \"I'm happy with the three goalkeepers. He [Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed. That is my feeling when I see the play.",
      "\"You choose to push a player [out of the way] or to get the ball in that moment. He needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and will let the ball pass.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has also given a scathing assessment of Bayindir's performance during the club's opening Premier League fixture. Speaking on Rio Presents, the United icon expressed serious reservations about the ex-Fenerbahce keeper.",
      "\"What I would say is that it was a cheap goal,\" he said. \"We gave away a goal. The keeper has got to be better. He'll be hugely disappointed, because this was his chance.",
      "\"The manager has gone with him and backed him and he's had, really, one thing to do in his penalty area and he didn't pass the test.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes had hoped for Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund to emerge as Manchester United's standout performers this season. But the duo appear to be heading towards the exit door as Ruben Amorim looks to offload more stars before the transfer window closes.",
      "Hojlund was left out of United's squad for Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, with AC Milan amongst the clubs showing interest in the striker. Meanwhile, Garnacho has found himself frozen out by the Portuguese manager following his criticism of Amorim's tactical decisions during their Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "The Danish forward has been training with the first team and participated in preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League season – but with Benjamin Sesko now at the club, Hojlund may have played his last match at Old Trafford.",
      "These developments will come as a blow to club captain Fernandes, who revealed his wish to see younger players claim individual honours rather than winning awards himself.",
      "Speaking to CBS back in May, the 30-year-old said: \"The main thing I want... and I was even joking with Josh [Zirkzee] the other day, we were talking about the awards and they were saying like, 'Oh, who's gonna win the award of Player of the Season?' They were kind of putting a joke.",
      "\"I said that I hope next year I am not even involved in the name – and do the same season as I did this year, and not be involved in the name of winning that trophy.",
      "\"Because that will mean you step up, Amad will step up, Garnacho will step up, Rasmus will step up... if they start scoring goals, start doing assists, start running backwards and tackling, they will be the ones having attention and not me, and I will be the most happy person in the world.",
      "\"I'm there to help my team-mates get the best out of them, and that's all I want to do because I know as soon as I can get the best out of them, my team will be much better.\"",
      "Despite these words from the Portuguese maestro, both Hojlund and Garnacho appear to have one foot out this summer at Old Trafford.",
      "AC Milan's sporting director, Igli Tare, recently revealed that the 22-year-old frontman remains on their radar -but he's not their sole target. He said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.\"",
      "The Italian giants may reportedly abandon their pursuit of the United ace if they manage to land Dusan Vlahovic from Juventus instead. United have slapped a modest £30million price tag on Hojlund – a dramatic drop from the £72m deal they agreed with Serie A outfit Atalanta two summers ago.",
      "Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano has reported that Chelsea are now in advanced talks with United over the signing of Garnacho. The report suggests that the Blues' hierarchy have an excellent relationship with United chief Omar Berrada.",
      "The 21-year-old winger, who is only interested in joining the FIFA Club World Cup champions, recently rejected an offer from Bayern Munich. The Red Devils have placed a £50m price tag on Garnacho, but as it stands, Chelsea are only willing to pay about £30m.",
      "Garnacho and Hojlund join Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho as the quartet set to depart the club, with Roma, Besiktas and Atalanta all eyeing moves for the latter duo.",

      "Collyer, 21, is among a pool of young players who are very highly thought of at Old Trafford. However, the club have decided that a spell playing regularly in the Championship would be beneficial for the young midfielder's development with West Brom subsequently clinching Collyer's signature ahead of other second-tier teams.",
      "The youngster made his debut for the Baggies at the weekend in their 3-2 win away at Wrexham but he could have been plying his trade elsewhere amid suggestions that the former Brighton academy starlet could be used as bait in a swap deal for Carlos Baleba.",
      "Collyer, meanwhile, has been sent to the Hawthorns for the 2025-26 campaign to play regular football. And Mason, formerly of Tottenham, wants to play a big part in Collyer's development over the next 12 months before he returns to Old Trafford next year.",
      "Speaking at the weekend, Mason told reporters: \"Toby's a young player, but we know we're going to need him and he's going to help us. I've wanted Toby for a few weeks now. He's someone that I really believe in, which is important and I have that belief in all of my players.",
      "\"But when you go on loan to somewhere, I think you need to feel like you're wanted from the club and the manager and he certainly is that. Hopefully we can help him because if we help him improve and grow as a player, then it's certainly going to be beneficial to us.",
      "\"I think there's loads of room and loads of growth to develop. That's certainly going to happen on the training pitch. The reality is the game is the best teacher. The more game exposure you can get, the better, especially at a young age. I'm sure and I expect that Toby knows that I believe in him, which for me is super important.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Michael Owen has queried Matheus Cunha's attitude following the Brazilian's first Premier League outing for the club. Cunha, a £62.5million summer arrival from Wolves, played the full 90 minutes against Arsenal on Sunday, starting as a No.9 and then dropping back when Benjamin Sesko came off the bench.",
      "Owen is excited by Cunha's quality, having watched him at his former club. However, question marks remain when it comes to other aspects of his on-field behaviour.",
      "“I think Cunha has got a little bit of magic about him. I love watching him play,\" Owen told AskGamblers. \"The first moment I set eyes on him for Wolves, I just thought: “Oh wow, he’s a talented player. I really rate him, and I don’t blame Manchester United for getting him. I think he’s so talented.",
      "“My only question mark is his attitude. He gets sent off a lot, he waves his arms a lot, and you’ve already got someone like that alongside him in Bruno Fernandes. From a talent point of view, he’s absolutely there. And maybe being at Manchester United, being at a huge club like that, might put some manners on him.",
      "“You can’t go around grabbing people’s glasses off them after a game, getting sent off, arguing with referees, and causing fights on numerous occasions like he did at Wolves. But when you’re the outstanding player and when you’ve been carrying the club, when all that pressure’s on you and all those different things, then you can understand it a bit. When you go to Manchester United, you’re in the public glare even more, and you need to behave that way.\"",
      "Owen suggested Cunha can still be a success at United if he irons out certain aspects of his behaviour. He served two suspensions last season, though - one for an altercation with an Ipswich staff member and anoter for a red card against Bournemouth in the FA Cup.",
      "He was initially banned for three games after lashing out at Milos Kerkez in the Bournemouth game. It was then extended by an extra match, though, to go along with the two-game ban he served for the Ipswich incident.",
      "Cunha, who scored 15 league goals for Wolves last season, didn't net for United in pre-season but is warming to his new challenge at Old Trafford. “I really think the pressure at this club is a privilege,” the former Atletico Madrid frontman said in July.",
      "“It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and when Ruben came to me and showed me the project, I felt like it’s a challenge I want to do for my career. United is a club I needed to be at, and like I say it’s a big privilege.”",

      "Sevilla star Lucien Agoume is the latest name to be linked with Manchester United as the Red Devils seek out cheaper alternatives to Carlos Baleba. United appear unwilling to meet Brighton's nine-figure asking price for Baleba, having already splashed £200million this summer.",
      "Earlier this week, it emerged that Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton were both being considered, though neither would be straightforward signings. Sporting Lisbon want big money to allow Hjulmand to reunite with Ruben Amorim, while Palace may decide they can't afford to lose Wharton if his team-mates Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi also leave this month.",
      "According to reports in Spain (via Sport Witness), Agoume has a release clause worth just under £35m and might be available for even less than that. Other, unnamed Premier League clubs are also said to be in the mix, though one-time suitors Arsenal are unlikely to return for the Frenchman after previous links, having landed Martin Zubimendi in July.",
      "Agoume joined Sevilla from Inter Milan in a cut-price deal in 2024, and was a regular last season as the team narrowly escaped relegation from La Liga. He was also part of the French side which reached the semi-finals of the Under-21 Euros, playing in all but one of their matches and captaining the side against Poland.",
      "While Profit and Sustainability Rules make a move for Baleba unlikely this summer, a cheaper option such as Agoume could be the answer. However, much may still depend on sales elsewhere.",
      "United have signed off on loan exits for the likes of Marcus Rashford and Toby Collyer, but are still working on permanent exits for some other players. Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund are among those who could yet leave, though United and Chelsea remain at odds over a valuation for the former.",
      "There are also questions in the goalkeeper position, as links with Gianluigi Donnarumma persist. The arrival of the Italian might rely on United selling Andre Onana, with Inter Milan said to be interested in bringing the Cameroonian back to the San Siro.",
      "Despite losing to Arsenal in their opening league game, United are looking at the positives after a tough end to last season. “The group, for me, is just, I don’t know, there’s such a good vibe. We’re all invested in something,” forward Joshua Zirkzee told club media.",
      "\"You can really tell that we really want to make sure that we’re not doing what we did last season. Also, outside the pitch, there’s some good vibes. We’re doing a lot of team bonding. I feel we’re much closer than we were last season, and hopefully we can translate all of that onto the pitch and share it with you, you know, the rest of the world who’s supporting United.”",

The 21-year-old Cameroon international is under contract with Brighton until June 2028, and the Seagulls are unwilling to budge on their significant demands having sold Moises Caicedo for £115m to Chelsea two years ago.",

      "Harry Maguire will discuss his future with Manchester United ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Maguire has entered the final year of his contract at Old Trafford, which means he will be free to talk to overseas clubs when the January window opens.",
      "United triggered the one-year extension in Maguire's contract last season. After a turbulent time at the club, the 32-year-old defender has enjoyed an Old Trafford renaissance in the last 18 months.",
      "Maguire overcame his confidence crisis and is regarded as a key player in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "However, Maguire started on the bench against Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday, with Matthijs de Ligt picked ahead of him for the central role in Amorim's back-three.",
      "United will decide whether to offer Maguire a new contract this season and the England international discussed his future with journalists at an event at Stretford High School.",
      "\"Last year, the clause was in their hands, so there was no option for me there,\" he said. \"There was no talking. It was just that they activated it, and it got extended. This year, obviously I'm up at the end of the year.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can't leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract.",
      "\"I'm sure over the next few months they'll sit down and we'll have to have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend, or obviously the transfer window will open again in January.",
      "\"Obviously, I have something in my mind about what I want to do and what I want to be. I don't want to put it out there to everybody, but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"",
      "Maguire was asked to clarify whether United said he was not leaving this summer, and he responded: \"Yes, I think there were a couple of clubs who maybe enquired or spoke with them and I think they got a quick response.",
      "\"Like I said, we're in a good place, positive as a club and I feel like the hierarchy has come in and Jason [Wilcox] and the manager, I feel like they're taking it in the right direction.",
      "\"I think it's been, since I started six years ago to where it is now, it's in a completely different place in terms of the structure behind the management staff.\"",
      "Maguire continued: \"I feel in a good place. It's been a couple of years now where I feel like I've played really well for this club again. I only had six months really where I had a bad dip of form. The previous two years was excellent. I've been a lot better in the last two-and-a-half years.",
      "\"Now I'm in a good place. I'm in a good place with the club and the fans. I've got a real good bond with them and it's a real special place to play. It's a huge privilege and honour to play for this club and it's something that I'll always be forever grateful for.\"",
      "Maguire attended a Manchester United Foundation event at Stretford High School to meet children between eight and 14 years old at a multi-sports holiday camp.",
      "The initiative is aimed at children in areas of social deprivation and low-income households, offering a range of sports throughout the day and a free lunch for the attendees.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Harry Maguire feels comfortable in his own skin again following a turbulent chapter of his career at Manchester United.",
      "Maguire was once booed by 'United fans' during a pre-season friendly at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Now his name is sung loudly by the Stretford End when he emerges to warm up on the touchline.",
      "The 32-year-old's redemption arc has put him on the path to cult hero status in Manchester and children at Stretford High School were delighted to see him at an event on Wednesday.",
      "Maguire visited a multi-sports holiday camp, aimed at children in areas of social deprivation and low-income households, to kick a ball with young fans and inspire the next generation.",
      "By the time of Maguire's appearance, the dust had settled on the Arsenal defeat and he said: \"It's disappointment in the end because this club demands winning football matches. And when you play for this club, you should never get the feeling of being happy after a game if you don't win.",
      "\"The first feeling, especially a couple of days after, is disappointment because we're sat at the table with zero points and we know it should be more. However, you can look at the pluses: the performance was a lot better, a lot more intensity and we actually deserved to get something from the game. There are two sides of it, but like I said, the gut feeling inside is disappointment.\"",
      "United were unfortunate to lose against Arsenal and the performance boded well for 2025/2026. \"I think last year we just weren't as big a threat going forward as we should have been for this club,\" said Maguire.",
      "\"This club demands players who create chances, score goals and that's what it's done throughout its history. So, I think Brian [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha] coming in, Sesko coming off the bench, these are players who have proven that they're going to score goals and create chances.",
      "\"I think last year there was some good performance against Tottenham and I remember going to Arsenal in the cup and playing with 10 men throughout it all, and we were very comfortable in the game. Going forward in that game, again, we just didn't create as much as we'd like. So, hopefully that's the things to come this season, should I say, in terms of that we're creating and scoring a lot more goals.\"",
      "Maguire discussed United's new signings, adding: \"Like I said, first and foremost, they're going to be a threat. I think when you play against them as an opposition defender, you're not going to have an easy afternoon.",
      "\"You're always going to be aware because you know that in one moment Matheus can score from anywhere or he can produce that little bit of magic, or Bryan can, like I say, he can score at the back post or he can curl one in.",
      "\"And then Benjamin [Sesko] is just a huge... He's obviously got great physical attributes and he's quick and he's strong and he's tall. He's very good in the air, attacking crosses and his movement in the box is really good. I think they're going to create and score goals, and that's what this club demands.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim appointed a new six-man leadership group this summer, consisting of Maguire, Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Noussair Mazraoui and Tom Heaton.",
      "Amorim feels strongly about having a group of players who have an influence on the dressing room, and the group should also reduce the workload on Fernandes' shoulders.",
      "\"I think the manager obviously wanted a group of players that he can speak to instead of piling it all on Bruno all the time,\" said Maguire. \"Maybe taking a little bit of weight off his shoulders as well in terms of he can lean on us for decisions and things.",
      "\"The manager likes a group of players, he's picked his group and it doesn't mean that anyone outside of that group of players isn't important to the manager or isn't seen as a leader because there are numerous leaders who aren't in that leadership group. It's just a small group.",
      "\"But if I'm being honest, Bruno is still the captain of the club. He's in charge of the players, but we'll give him a big support, which to be honest, we did and I did before that. So, I think it's probably getting made out a little bit more than what it actually is.",
      "\"It's just a group where we can feed things through to the staff and the management and look after the club in general and give Bruno a little bit of weight off his shoulders.\"",
      "Maguire continued: \"I think instead of everyone always going to Bruno and giving Bruno the problems and then he has to feed them through, I think he can lead off the other six players as well.",
      "\"Also, the six who he's chosen have got to obviously drive the standards in training day in, day out. It's an experienced group of people, but like I said, I think it is probably getting looked into a little bit too much.",
      "\"I think as a squad of 25, we've all got to be leaders in there. To play for this club, you've got to be a big personality and you've got to be your own leader in your own way. So, yes, it's a group, but like I say, it doesn't make anyone more important than others.\"",
      "Maguire was named on the bench against Arsenal last weekend and Matthijs de Ligt started in the centre of the back-three. Maguire agreed that reacting professionally to selection decisions is part of his role.",
      "\"I think I've always done that throughout my career,\" he said. \"It's not something just because I'm in this leadership group that I'll start to do now. I'm sure there's going to be many games I play this season and I'm going to be playing a lot of games from the start. I know that.",
      "\"The manager has got a lot of tough choices now. I think the squad is really competitive, really good competition, good high-level players in each position. Yes, me and Matthijs have been playing that central role, but also we can play either side in the back three as well. I've proven that.",
      "\"I've done that for England and Matthijs has done that numerous times for the Netherlands as well. No, there's competition for places all over the pitch and I think that's healthy in the squad.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amorim has banished the 'bomb squad'. The dressing room mood has improved and sources have admitted Amorim has created a feeling of 'us against them' by excluding some big names.",
      "Maguire said: \"It's a great feeling in the dressing room. I think it was nice, if I'm being honest, to just feel like it was a bit of a fresh start after last season. Last season was so tough to play in there.",
      "\"The situation that we were in, February, March time, we've got nothing to play for. It was a real tough, apart from the Europa League obviously and everyone was focusing on that.",
      "\"But then when you get beat in the Premier League, it still piles down on you. It was a tough situation for the manager to come into and all his staff because he was really preparing for the Europa League and we never had a settled team in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think this season you're going to see a lot more competitiveness from us in the Premier League. But listen, the camp is always positive going into a season when you play for this club.",
      "\"The results determine how it goes, and that's what we need to drive and maintain and make sure that it stays positive throughout because we want to get good results and good performances.\"",
      "Maguire has entered the autumn of his career and is well-positioned to offer advice. United received intense criticism last season and Maguire would advise his younger colleagues to ignore social media.",
      "\"I'm sure they'd have been getting slaughtered left, right and centre, if I'm being honest,\" responded Maguire when asked about social media abuse last season. \"I hope they don't go on and read the comments when they've had a bad game, or read the direct messages on Instagram.",
      "\"I hope the players stay away and they learn that they don't need to be told by other people whether they're doing right or wrong. As a footballer, you know if you're playing well and you know if you're doing things right and if you make a mistake, you know if you've made a mistake.",
      "\"So, you don't need to go on and get clarification from other people. We know where social media is. It's a tough place sometimes, but then also it does have its positives that you can connect in a positive way and see day-to-day things. It can be good and it can be bad.\"",
      "Did Maguire ever come to a point where he had to switch off completely? \"No, not really,\" he replied. \"I've always been quite good at handling criticism or whatever. It doesn't really get to me or bother me too much.",
      "\"I've been mentally strong throughout it all, but I'm only speaking advice now I'm 32. I'm giving these younger lads experience that they are going to go through sticky times at this club, no matter how good it is.",
      "\"I'm sure the likes of David Beckham and Wayne Rooney went through it, and they are world-class players. Wayne's one of the best players to play for England and this club, and he had so much abuse.",
      "\"You're going to get it. You've just got to find the best way of dealing with it. There's a lot of club and support around them now and rightly so.\"",
      "In a recent interview with Rio Ferdinand, Maguire said that some social media abuse is dished out by people who just want to see United fail. \"Yes, I do believe that a lot of the social media laughing and joking and the memes and things like that obviously are rival fans,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not saying it's just Manchester United players who get it because there will be other players who get it. It's other top clubs as well. It's part and parcel of playing for this club. It's one of the best clubs in the world and you get a lot of spotlight on you, and you've got to learn to deal with it.\"",
      "Maguire showed remarkable mental strength to overcome a difficult period. In his own words, he is in a \"better place\" now. His relationship with supporters has been salvaged and he is keen to savour fan events, like at Stretford High School, as he enters the final year of his contract.",
      "\"When I joined this club, I noticed straight away that you have a huge responsibility on the pitch, but you also have a massive responsibility off the pitch and this club has a worldwide fan base,\" he said.",
      "\"It's incredible. You don't realise it until you're actually in it, the fan base, when you go on tours, when you go to Malaysia and India and when you come to places like this, there's so many kids out there, they're all in Man United kits. After the season we had last year as well, our fans just stick with us.",
      "\"We lost the Europa League final against Spurs, awful season for ourselves and then we go and play Villa at home against Old Trafford and it was packed out, the atmosphere was unbelievable.",
      "\"We got clapped off the pitch at the end of the game. It just doesn't happen at other clubs and the fans at this club have been incredible with us and now I feel like we're on a bit of a start of a journey with everything in place to take this club back to where it should be and it's one that I'm looking forward to be part of.\"",
      "Maguire continued: \"It's amazing to be here with the kids. When you turn up and you see them chanting your name and just putting a big smile on their face, the energy is infectious.",
      "\"And I take some of this energy and take it back to the training ground. It’s nice in terms of that because when you come here, like I say, they're having fun, but they're working hard and they're out in the fresh air.",
      "\"It's really good for them physically, mentally, playing with their friends, socialising. So, it's great to see them all playing with a big smile on their face.\"",
      "Maguire has been playing with a smile on his own face again in the last 18 months.",

      "In June, it was confirmed that Cox was to leave the academy after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton. During his time in charge, Cox has played a pivotal role in United's academy's renaissance, securing top youth signings and overseeing an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022.",

      "\"I haven't spoken to Antony,\" he said this week. \"We all know he was very happy during the six-month period he was with us. We want him back, he certainly wants to come back, but it depends on what the transfer holder, which is Manchester United, wants to do with him.\"",

Speaking during his unveiling press conference, Ratcliffe alluded to the hidden clauses that could come into play.",

      "Taking to X, he wrote: \"Napoli have made new contact with Man United today for Rasmus Hojlund deal. Hojlund’s camp also in talks with Napoli as player’s keen on the move while also wants guarantees to stay at the club in future, not a simple loan. Negotiations ongoing.\"",
      "According to journalist Jorge Nicola, Antony is not interested in a return to Brazil at this stage of his career.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Nicola said: \"Despite links to Botafogo this summer, there is no possibility of Antony returning to the Brazilian league at the moment. This morning (Wednesday), I spoke to Antony's agent, Junior Pedroso, who is currently in Europe working to resolve Antony's future.",
      "\"He assured me that a return to Brazil is not part of Antony's career plans right now. John Textor [Botafogo owner], did reach out to Antony's entourage some time ago over a potential deal, but that was not possible. São Paulo are also aware of the financial demands and, as a result, have not even approached Pedroso. The most likely outcome is a return to Real Betis, where Antony enjoyed an impressive loan spell last season.\"",
      "Man United's 'Bomb Squad' is proving to be more difficult to move on than first thought and with less than two weeks until the transfer window closes, it's proving a critical problem.",
      "At the start of the summer, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, , Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Jadon Sancho all informed the club of their desire to leave. Fast forward to today and only Rashford has left the club. Unfortunately for United, Malacia, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony remain on the books and moves away don't seem to be close. Garnacho has recently reportedly rejected a move to Bayern Munich in favour of Chelsea, though that is no closer to being finalised than before, while Antony continues to be heavily linked with returning to Real Betis.",
      "Sancho, who has spent the last season-and-a-half on loan away from Old Trafford, is the subject of interest from AS Roma. Sky Italy have reported that both teams have reached an agreement on a deal worth €19million (£16.4m) plus €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons.

      "Sky Sport Italy report that Hojlund is pushing for a permanent transfer, with Napoli having held talks with Manchester United.",

      "Bruno Fernandes wished for Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund to step up and become Man United's best players over the new season.",
      "Garnacho fell out of favour with Ruben Amorim long before pre-season began, after criticising Amorim's substitutions during their Europa League final defeat against Tottenham Hotspur. Hojlund has trained with the squad and took part in the preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League campaign – but with Benjamin Sesko now in the building, the Danish striker could have graced Old Trafford for the final time.",

      "\"I said that I hope next year I am not even involved in the name – and do the same season as I did this year, and not be involved in the name of winning that trophy. Because that will mean you step up, Amad will step up, Garnacho will step up, Rasmus will step up… if they start scoring goals, start doing assists, start running backwards and tackling, they will be the ones having attention and not me, and I will be the most happy person in the world.",

      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were excellent in United's front three, while Benjamin Sesko looked bright from the bench. All three players were signed this summer for a combined fee north of £200million but the signs are looking good that they prove to be a success.",

      "If Manchester United needed proof that they've signed the right players this summer - Sunday's performance against Arsenal offered some positive indications.",

      "However, a recent report in The Athletic suggested that United have now 'ceased' their pursuit for Baleba for this summer.

      "Does anyone remember Tyrell Malacia? He's still on the books at Manchester United.",
      "Malacia was placed into the 'bomb squad' in July, alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, but it felt slightly harsh to categorise Malacia in that group.",
      "The Dutchman has not worked his ticket like Rashford, Garnacho and Sancho. Malacia is simply not good enough for United. Ruben Amorim looked at Malacia after his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in November and quickly decided he should look for a new club in the January transfer window.",
      "Malacia was shipped out to PSV Eindhoven on loan and he made just six starts in all competitions during that stint, which confirmed ahead of the official decision that PSV would not be signing him permanently.",
      "PSV won the Eredivisie last season, so perhaps it was unrealistic for Malacia to break into their side after joining in the middle of the campaign, but Malacia's performances since his return from a serious knee injury last season suggest he might need to lower his sights for his next move.",
      "Interest has been thin on the ground in Malacia since his delayed return to Carrington. The left-back has been training on his own and his agent is working to arrange an exit before the transfer deadline.",
      "Malacia's dream of succeeding at Old Trafford is over and he must be given a degree of sympathy because a knee injury curtailed his time in Manchester. Would Malacia have been a success at United without that injury? Maybe not, but it was a challenging period and he's probably just happy to be playing again.",
      "The 26-year-old initially played through the injury at the end of the 2022/2023 season. Injections were used to get through games. Malacia then underwent surgery but required further surgery after a botched first attempt.",
      "After 517 days on the sidelines, Malacia made his return for the Under-21s against Huddersfield in November, and an interview about his recovery was published on the following day.",
      "\"We spoke to the guy who did my [first knee] surgery and then we made the decision: we had to do something else. I had to start my rehab over, basically… I had one day to be disappointed,\" Malacia told The Athletic.",
      "\"Then I had to be like, ‘OK, we go again’. I think at the end of the day, everything I did, even if it was a mistake or something, I won’t even see it as a mistake because it’s a lesson.",
      "\"I think everything in life is already written for me. I had to go through this whole process to be where I’m at now, so I wouldn’t do anything different.",
      "“You can ask the guys at the club — every time I came in, even though I was feeling s***, sometimes they were like, ‘Oh, your energy is so good, you give me energy again… how is he still smiling, or how is he still working after this and this happened to him?’.",
      "“Of course, I’ve had some moments where I was like, ‘Oh, I’m getting tired of this’ but there’s no way I could ever give up. It’s not my system, it’s not in our family.\"",
      "Malacia was on a long road to recovery, but when he returned, he was not provided with respite because he faced an even bigger challenge: fighting for his future at Old Trafford.",
      "The defender was recently spotted training with a private coach at non-league club Trafford FC. He has trained alone at Carrington over the last month and was recently pictured leaving the training ground with Sancho.",
      "Malacia's time at the club hasn't worked out as hoped and all parties are hoping the chapter is closed this summer. United want to arrange a permanent departure and Malacia will be hoping for the same.",

      "After internal discussions and the arrival of Diego Leon this summer, Amass was earmarked for a loan exit. Ruben Amorim gave Amass his first-team debut against Leicester in March and the youngster made seven first-team appearances last season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday are leading the race for the youngster, with other Championship clubs also interested.",
      "The 19-year-old winger was a late call up to the United squad for the summer tour of America.",
      "He scored in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth in Chicago and caught the eye with his performances.",
      "United are prepared to sanction a loan move and he has been linked with League One pair Stockport County and Barnsley.",
      "The centre back impressed in senior showings last season and may well be retained by Amorim for the forthcoming campaign.",
      "But the imminent return to fitness of Lisandro Martinez and the return to the XI of Luke Shaw mean United have plenty of options in defence when everyone is available.",
      "Fredricson was on the bench for the season opener against Arsenal alongside fellow defenders Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven, who are both ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Once Martinez is fit, minutes could be hard to come by at senior level for Fredricson and a loan could be explored, but given the injury issues that blighted United last term and the need to carry at least five centre back options to cover the back three formation, the chances are the 20-year-old remains at Old Trafford.",

      "The Italian shot-stopper has excelled in his four-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain, though it seems his time in the French capital is nearing its end. Donnarumma has reached the final 12 months of his deal at the Parc des Princes and is searching for fresh opportunities after Les Parisiens brought in Lucas Chevalier as a replacement.",
      "Ruben Amorim has enjoyed a predominantly positive first summer in the transfer market with the Red Devils, securing talents like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, Owen thinks he ought to be considering bolstering the club's choices between the sticks, particularly given that Donnarumma is looking for a move.",
      "Speaking to the Mirror via 247Bet, Owen said: \"Well, when it all came out about Donnarumma leaving Paris Saint-Germain, I thought, 'Oh my word, whoever gets him are going to be a lucky team.",
      "\"I mean, he is unbelievable. He's literally one of, if not the best goalkeeper in the world. I mean, he would be the obvious one, but whether they can get him or not is another matter.\"",
      "United had to call on Altay Bayindir against Arsenal due to Andre Onana's recovery from injury and lack of match fitness. However, many supporters may feel that the club needs to find a permanent replacement for Onana if they are to improve on last season's disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "The Cameroonian has not justified his £47.2million transfer fee since joining Old Trafford from Inter Milan two years ago, and has been criticised for making several high-profile errors. While Donnarumma is a feasible option at the moment, given that PSG are reportedly only asking for £40m for the 26-year-old, United will face tough competition to secure a deal.",
      "Manchester City are currently at risk of losing Ederson to Galatasaray, and despite acquiring James Trafford in a £27m move earlier this summer, the youngster may need more time to develop before he can be a reliable starter. As a result, the Cityzens are rumoured to be interested in bringing Donnarumma to the Etihad Stadium before the transfer deadline, and talks are said to have begun with the European champions.",
      "However, a reluctance to meet PSG's asking price could leave the door open for their neighbours to swoop in for the keeper. With four Ligue 1 titles, five domestic trophies and a Champions League triumph to his name in the French capital, Donnarumma would likely slot directly into the starting XI under Pep Guardiola or Amorim.",
      "He also let in just 25 goals in the league last season and registered five clean sheets. Owen has also pointed out other departments where United would be sensible to concentrate on enhancing should they hope to climb back to the top of the Premier League.",
      "He added: \"Well, I mean, there are areas where they could strengthen. If they want to go and be a top team again and challenge for the league, then there's loads of areas.",

      "\"They've got a lot of defenders at the moment, whether they've got many great ones is a question mark. But I think over time they're going to need to change a fair few players, but just to get them back up in fifth, sixth place type of thing this season, I think they've got more than enough to do that.\"",

      "Manchester United youngster Kobbie Mainoo was an unused substitute against Arsenal last weekend.",
      "There have been concerns about where Mainoo fits into Ruben Amorim's plans, but we're just one game into the new Premier League campaign and it's certainly not time to panic.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro started in the pivot against Arsenal. Manuel Ugarte was introduced for Casemiro in the 65th minute of the contest and Mainoo was left on the bench, clearly for tactical reasons.",
      "Ugarte has a different profile and Amorim decided his qualities were best suited to replace Casemiro. Mainoo started two games in pre-season and they were both alongside Ugarte in the pivot.",
      "Fernandes made a few appearances in the No.10 role in pre-season, which allowed Mainoo a chance to start in the deeper role, but it seems like the pair are competing for the same role in the pivot.",
      "It seems Amorim views Ugarte and Casemiro as competitors for one of the deeper midfield positions, and views Fernandes and Mainoo as competitors for the partnership's other side.",
      "Amorim has tinkered with Mainoo's position since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November, which hasn't been particularly helpful, but it appears he has decided on which role is best for him.",
      "\"I think he [Mainoo] can play in both positions in the midfield. Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball,\" explained Amorim in the USA.",
      "\"I think he is a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. I think he needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I'm always on top of that with Kobbie, because he is so good sometimes but he can be better. So I have big plans. But again, like I said, one game per week, the competition is going to be huge.\"",
      "Amorim also said Fernandes' best position in his system is 'closest to the ball' and he started him in the deeper role against Arsenal, so it's fair to conclude that's where he sees Mainoo's future.",
      "There were valid concerns about Amorim's handling of Mainoo last season, with the signs suggesting his future might be elsewhere, but there was a change of tone when Amorim spoke about him this summer.",
      "Amorim was notably positive and seemed enthusiastic about working with Mainoo, however, he tempered expectations last season and said he still has a long way to go in his development.",
      "At 20 years old, Mainoo is obviously far from the finished article, but he is a supremely talented young player, and it would be a travesty if Amorim couldn't make it work this term.",
      "Not coming on from the bench against Arsenal is not a big deal and Amorim should be given a few months to work with Mainoo before any concrete judgments are made on his future.",
      "If Mainoo is a peripheral squad member by November, then alarm bells will be set ringing. United are competing in the Premier League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup this season, which means fewer opportunities, but Mainoo has enough talent to merit regular starts in Amorim's team.",
      "There is huge interest in Mainoo, given he is an academy graduate and was so brilliant in 2023/2024, but supporters will have to wait and see how the situation unfolds before rushing to panic stations.",
      "Remember Mainoo's performance at Goodison Park on his Premier League debut? Remember his matchwinner against Manchester City in the FA Cup final? Amorim must make it work with the Stockport-born lad.",

      "Manchester United owners the Glazer family are now free to sell their majority share in the football club after a clause became active earlier this month - as per national media reports.",
      "On August 13, a clause in the finer print of the deal which saw Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquire 25 per cent of the club last February came into play, known as the \"drag-along\" right. It means that if the Glazers want to sell the club, Sir Jim and Ineos have no power to stop them.",
      "The clause was agreed to become active 18 months after Sir Jim's minority takeover and added that, the Glazers could decide to not only sell their stake, but also force Ineos to do likewise.",
      "The Daily Mail have reported that, despite that clause being active, any movement in the United's ownership is currently unlikely owing to the relationship between Sir Jim and the Glazers. Speaking during his unveiling press conference, Sir Jim hinted at hidden clauses which could come into play.",
      "\"I don't think we're going to be taking the legal agreements out of the bottom drawer,\" he said. \"I just hope they gather dust and we never see them. Which it should be. It should be on the basis of a relationship.\"",
      "It's understood that the Glazers and Sir Jim get on - and have a positive relationship. One source has told The Daily Mail that they get on so much that \"Jim has flown over to the US on multiple occasions to have board meetings on their doorstep. They are like-minded people.\"",
      "Back in 2023, a Sheikh Jassim attempt to secure a £4.79billion whole takeover of the club was rejected in favour of Sir Jim's minority stake. It allowed the Glazers to remain in place and Sheikh Jassim missed out.",
      "The report from The Daily Mail has revealed that sources with knowledge of Sheikh Jassim's 92 Foundation have claimed there's \"zero interest\" in acting upon the active clause. It's said the interest in Qatar has moved elsewhere to \"mega projects\" in other sporting fields.",
      "Qatar are, currently, attempting to host the 2036 Olympics - with any side projects unlikely to be given the green light. It's also claimed that the Sheikh Jassim's group keenness to buy a leading club in Europe is no longer on their agenda.",

      "It opens the door for a majority or full takeover of the football club - with Sir Jim Ratcliffe understood to have first dibs on the remaining Glazers shares. However, right now, it seems unlikely that there will be any movement in the ownership of the club.",
      "That report from The Daily Mail has revealed that sources with knowledge of Sheikh Jassim's 92 Foundation have claimed there's \"zero interest\" in acting upon the active clause. It's said the interest in Qatar has moved elsewhere to \"mega projects\" in other sporting fields.",

      "\"The bid plans to return the club to its former glories,\" they said. \"The bid will be completely debt free, via Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation, which will look to invest in the football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience and the communities the club supports.",

      "Bruno Fernandes wished for Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund to step up and become Manchester United's best players over the new season.",
      "However, the duo look to be well on their way to forgetting that dream, as Ruben Amorim pushes to sell more players before the transfer window shuts. Hojlund was omitted from United's matchday squad that lost 1-0 to Arsenal on Sunday amid interest from AC Milan, among others.",
      "Meanwhile, Garnacho fell out of favour with the Portuguese boss long before pre-season began, after criticising Amorim's substitutions during their Europa League final defeat against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Hojlund has trained with the squad and took part in the preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League campaign – but with Benjamin Sesko now in the building, the Danish striker could have graced Old Trafford for the final time.",
      "These revelations will disappoint club captain Fernandes, who opened up about his desire not to win the Player of the Season award in May and instead hand it over to one of his younger team-mates.",
      "Speaking to CBS back in May, the 30-year-old said: \"The main thing I want… and I was even joking with Josh [Zirkzee] the other day, we were talking about the awards and they were saying like, ‘Oh, who’s gonna win the award of Player of the Season?’ They were kind of putting a joke.",
      "\"I said that I hope next year I am not even involved in the name – and do the same season as I did this year, and not be involved in the name of winning that trophy.",
      "\"Because that will mean you step up, Amad will step up, Garnacho will step up, Rasmus will step up… if they start scoring goals, start doing assists, start running backwards and tackling, they will be the ones having attention and not me, and I will be the most happy person in the world.",
      "\"I’m there to help my team-mates get the best out of them, and that’s all I want to do because I know as soon as I can get the best out of them, my team will be much better.\"",
      "Despite this wish from the Portuguese playmaker, Hojlund and Garnacho each have one foot out of the door at Old Trafford, it seems. AC Milan's sporting director, Igli Tare, recently noted that the 22-year-old striker is a viable option for the Italian giants – but not their only one.",
      "He said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.\" Milan may reportedly drop their interest in the United man if they can secure Dusan Vlahovic from Juventus instead.",
      "United value Hojlund at a reasonable £30million – a far cry from his £72m deal they struck with Serie A side Atalanta two summers ago.",
      "Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano reports that Chelsea are now in advanced talks with United over the signing of Garnacho. The report claims the Blues hierarchy have an excellent relationship with United's chief executive officer, Omar Berrada.",
      "The 21-year-old winger, who only wants to join the FIFA Club World Cup champions, recently turned down an approach from Bayern Munich. The Red Devils have priced Garnacho at £50m, but Chelsea are only prepared to pay about £30m as things stand.",
      "Garnacho and Hojlund join Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho as the four-strong squad that are on their way out of the club, with Roma, Besiktas and Atalanta all considering moves for the latter pair.",

    "body": [
      "Manchester United stars Bryan Mbeumo and Andre Onana have both shown their admiration to Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba amid interest from United.",
      "Baleba was identified as Ruben Amorim's ideal candidate to strengthen his midfield following Benjamin Sesko's arrival. However, a move for the Cameroonian international failed to gather pace.",
      "United have spent big in the transfer window this summer, splashing over £200million on Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo. Further additions relied heavily on getting players out of the door but that has proven to be difficult.",
      "Marcus Rashford is the only big-name departure, leaving on loan for Barcelona. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all remain at the club despite not being involved in Amorim's squad throughout the summer.",
      "Brighton's £100m-plus price tag, one they are adamant about sticking to, has also meant any summer move for Baleba is extremely unlikely at this point. However, it isn't impossible with interest growing in Garnacho, Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "In United's first game of the season against Arsenal, the midfield pivot came under scrutiny with Bruno Fernandes partnering Casemiro. While Fernandes performed well, Casemiro struggled at times and Manuel Ugarte, who came off the bench to replace the Brazilian, also failed to make an impact.",
      "A new midfielder, as well a goalkeeper, is the priority at Old Trafford before the window closes on September 1. Baleba continues to be linked with a move to Manchester and the player is one who is liked by two of Amorim's current charges.",
      "Mbeumo and Onana, who play alongside Baleba for the Cameroon national team, have recently made their feelings known of the midfielder's ability. Baleba played in Brighton's opening day draw with Fulham and took to Instagram to react.",
      "Posting a series of images from the match, Baleba said it is \"just me doing the thing I love most\" in a hint towards his current happiness at Brighton. \"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut,\" the caption said in full.",
      "Alongside over 287,000 people, Mbeumo and Onana both liked the midfielder's post, which included hundreds of comments urging the 21-year-old to come to United this summer.",

    "body": [
      "Manchester United have spent more than £200million for the third summer out of the last four but are unlikely to be done there.",
      "There are clearly two areas of the squad that could, or should, be reinforced before the 7pm deadline on September 1 but, as is often the case with United in August, the priority has to be outgoings.",
      "United have at least five players they want to jettison yet they have still not outright sold a member of their first team squad this summer. Marcus Rashford, the most high-profile departure, joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "There are at least seven deals for United to negotiate over the next 13 days:",
      "Sign a midfielder",
      "As good as Carlos Baleba might be, United making a beeline for him a few years after they rued passing on Moises Caicedo seemed rather narrow-minded. Brighton polish gems better than most clubs yet value them much more than diamonds. United do not have the headroom for a record midfield signing.",
      "But they do need a midfielder and need to get creative. Manuel Ugarte, a dubious choice to bolster the midfield last year, is still playing second fiddle to the ageing Casemiro and it feels like United have all but given up on a player Ruben Amorim coached at Sporting.",
      "Joao Palhinha would have been a smart move by United but the word is they want permanent additions and he joined Tottenham Hotspur on loan from Bayern Munich. With deadline day less than a fortnight away, United may have to compromise on that stance.",
      "Sign a goalkeeper",
      "United have been on the lookout for a 'keeper for the entire calendar year, though sources stressed a new No.1 was not a priority. There are figures at the club prepared to give Andre Onana the benefit of the doubt and Amorim likes the Cameroonian.",
      "A bigger problem than Onana is what is behind him. Altay Bayindir is not Premier League quality and demonstrated that again against Arsenal, having got away with one on the final day of last season when he spilt the ball into Morgan Rogers' path. Bayindir was bailed out by a worse error by the referee.",
      "Amorim's reaction to the mention of Tom Heaton was akin to Hogwarts pupils' horror at the mention of Lord Voldemort. That would suggest Heaton may not get a kick for the third season running at United.",
      "Amorim claimed on Sunday he is \"happy\" with the goalkeeping options. It was delivered with all the diplomacy of a scheming politician.",
      "Sell Garnacho",
      "With the exception of Rashford, the bomb squad members have predictably remained in situ into the last fortnight of the window. Clubs are prepared to wait it out and force their value down, none more so brazenly than Chelsea with Garnacho.",
      "United sources feel that Chelsea's interest in January was part of the long game. A long game that Garnacho's representatives, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, participated in when they visited Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea are the only bidders at the table after Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Atletico Madrid passed on Garnacho. The 21-year-old's publicly puerile behaviour mounts more pressure on United to sell him.",
      "United are determined not to undervalue a player whose valuation was listed at €97.4m by the CIES Football Observatory 12 months ago. But the closer we get to the deadline the more Garnacho's value diminishes.",
      "Sell Sancho",
      "Jadon Sancho is out of contract at United in ten months and is such a tough sell Chelsea paid £5m not to sign him. He has sought refuge in Italy, a sanctuary for Premier League rejects. Yet Sancho is refusing to take a salary cut, as if he is worth the £250,000-a-week United remunerated him with four years ago.",
      "If United cannot get a fee for Sancho then they would have to consider paying him off just to get him out of the building. Amusingly, a player who was banished from the first team dressing room at Carrington and has not played a competitive match for United in two years has his own space in the new changing area at the training complex. It is in United's interests to have Sancho's name taken down.",
      "Sell Malacia",
      "Talking of tough sells: Malacia did not play a club game for 550 days, was substituted at half-time in four of his five starts last term, was loaned to the Eredivisie and PSV Eindhoven did not want to make his loan a permanent deal.",
      "Malacia, billed as a \"youngster\" by club media last year, is now 26 and his deal expires next year. United only require a few million quid to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules yet even the cheapest addition of the Erik ten Hag era is tough to shift. You could count the number of good games Malacia had for United on one hand.",
      "Sell Antony",
      "Antony excelled in La Liga and regained his place in the Brazil squad. In different circumstances, there would be a market for him.",
      "There is not one because United yielded to Ten Hag's demands and agreed a €100m deal with Ajax for Antony three years ago. United require around £32.5m not to make a loss on Antony, under contract until 2027. Few clubs could afford that and part with it.",
      "Antony has season-long loan with obligation to buy (minus a Sancho-style loophole) written all over him.",
      "Sell Hojlund",
      "For such a candid coach, it was mystifying that Amorim skirted the issue of Rasmus Hojlund's squad omission against Arsenal. It was established months ago that United had planned to sell Hojlund and he is not the first to be bombed out by Amorim after speaking publicly about his position in the team.",
      "Italy always seemed a likely exit route after Inter Milan touched base in the summer. Hojlund could return to northern Italy but to AC. United are so prepared to cut their losses they would accept £30m.",

      "\"Andre recovered.\" The words of Ruben Amorim on Friday. Onana stayed in his purple Manchester United hoodie and tracksuit bottoms at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Onana had three team training sessions before the Arsenal fixture, an insufficient number in Amorim's eyes. So Altay Bayindir kept goal, Tom Heaton was on the bench and Dermot Mee assisted with the warm-up.",
      "Bayindir blundered, United lost and Amorim seethed at the suggestion that Heaton, 40 in April and without any playing time since February 2023, should have started ahead of him.",
      "The post-match questioning centred so heavily on the goalkeeper that it was the quickest an Amorim press conference had been wrapped up. United had performed admirably but lost because of his choice of goalkeeper. Questions on that topic were inevitable.",
      "Whenever Onana does not play, United cannot have him back between the sticks quickly enough. Bayindir did not cover himself in glory at Newcastle United in April when Onana was taken out of the firing line in the wake of his lapses in Lyon.",
      "After persistent questioning from a colleague, Amorim assured journalists he was \"happy\" with the United goalkeeper department. He can't be. Onana has had two error-strewn seasons and Bayindir is inadequate back-up.",
      "This correspondent reported in May that a goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United and they have not wavered. They have been on the lookout for one, serious enough to chance their arm with a loan offer for Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa.",
      "Midway through last season, United considered goalies to come in but not as outright number ones. A competitive understudy to Onana would be the smart move.",
      "Goalkeepers are protective of each other and Onana rates Bayindir. He is in the minority. Bayindir has conceded 21 goals in 12 United appearances. The three matches that they conceded four goals in last season - away at Tottenham, Newcastle and Brentford - came with Bayindir in goal.",
      "The standard of United's first and second-choice goalies is so low there is not an argument to rotate them. It is not even akin to Roy Carroll and Tim Howard in 2004-05, never mind David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard for the first half of the 2011-12 campaign or De Gea and Dean Henderson in 2020-21. If Onana is remotely fit, he should always start.",
      "Erik ten Hag knew it and he was the manager when Bayindir signed. He did just about anything he could to not play him, delaying Onana's release for the Africa Cup of Nations in January 2024. Bayindir's only outings under Ten Hag were against League Two Newport County and League One Barnsley in domestic cup ties.",
      "Bayindir's international situation has partly caused United to preserve the status quo. He is always picked for Turkey squads to play second fiddle, so there is not the incentive for Bayindir to get on the move and guarantee a call-up for the World Cup next year.",
      "Arguably the best 'keeper in the world is on the market now. Paris Saint-Germain want to cash in on Gianluigi Donnarumma but United are not expected to come calling for a goalie reputedly demanding £400,000-a-week. If Donnarumma ends up in Manchester, it is likely to be at City.",
      "Onana expects to stay with United more intent on recruiting a midfielder than a goalkeeper before the September 1 deadline. His hamstring injury has had an undeniable influence on the dormant state of the club's goalkeeping department.",
      "United have promising goalies on loan in the Championship and League Two. Radek Vitek, a teammate of Kobbie Mainoo's and Alejandro Garnacho's in the FA Youth Cup-winning squad in 2022, has kept two clean sheets in two games for Bristol City in the second tier.",
      "The unspoken rule at United is academy players loaned to the Championship have a decent chance of returning to the first team squad. With Heaton in his 40th year and Bayindir and Onana highly unlikely to start a fourth successive season as No.1 and No.2, Vitek is auspiciously placed for a promotion if he continues his solid start at Ashton Gate.",
      "Elyh Harrison is lower down the pyramid at Shrewsbury Town and could be lower come the campaign's conclusion. They have lost their first two matches and are one of the favourites to drop into the National League. Dean Henderson enhanced his reputation on loan at Shrewsbury in 2017-18, back when they were attempting to break into the Championship.",
      "It has been three-and-a-half years since Henderson last played for United and no good can come from dwelling on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's mismanagement of him. United are improving their development of club-trained 'keepers, so much so that Matej Kovar fetched a respectable fee of £7.7million from Bayer Leverkusen in 2023. The Czech Republic number one absconded to PSV Eindhoven last month after Ten Hag, who sanctioned his sale by United, arrived at the BayArena.",
      "Ten Hag resisted a reunion with Onana. His new goalkeeper, Mark Flekken, is Dutch and shares the same agent.",

      "Benjamin Sesko's debut for Manchester United on Sunday drew plenty of excitement from the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "Any striker arriving at a new club comes with the promise of goals - a prospect even more tantalising at M16 after the Reds' struggles in that department last term. United netted just 44 times in the Premier League in 2024/25. It was no wonder they endured their worst campaign in a generation.",
      "Sesko has the physical and technical characteristics to succeed in English football - hinting at a better future for Ruben Amorim's team. As ever in the transfer window, all eyes are on the next deal and many fans will be growing impatient at the lack of sales which are restricting any further incomings.",
      "However, a transfer domino effect could soon take place which has inadvertently been caused by Sesko's switch to United from RB Leipzig. The Athletic claim that Leipzig are stepping up talks with Chelsea over a deal to sign Christopher Nkunku.",
      "It is said that the Blues value their French forward at £43.2million - a fee Leipzig can surely now afford after Sesko's £74m move to Old Trafford.",
      "And Nkunku's departure from Stamford Bridge should then open the door for wantaway United forward Alejandro Garnacho to join Enzo Maresca's side. It has been claimed on Tuesday that talks are advancing over a deal that will see Garnacho arrive at West London this summer.",
      "United are said to want £50m for their academy graduate - a fee which would represent a huge PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) boost. The player's homegrown status would mean any sale would be pure profit - allowing the club more wriggle room to bring new players in.",
      "All eyes will now be on whether Nkunku's move has any impact on Chelsea coming closer to United's asking price for Garnacho. The club have struggled to reach agreements which would see other wantaway stars - Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony - leave this summer.",
      "Yet their deal for Sesko - already regarded as significant for United this season - may soon have another crucial impact on their rebuild under Amorim.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United lost their opening Premier League game against Arsenal, but there were positives to take from the performance, including Matthijs de Ligt's solid display.",
      "De Ligt, Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw limited Arsenal's chances throughout and were only denied a clean sheet due to an awful goalkeeping error from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "The back three's performance bodes well for the season and De Ligt, in particular, impressed as Arsenal attempted to create, winning eight duels, making six clearances, and winning five aerial duels.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli hardly had a sniff throughout the afternoon. De Ligt probably found Gyokeres on his kitchen table when he emptied his pockets when he returned home.",
      "Former England manager Glenn Hoddle worked as a pundit for Premier League Productions on Sunday and said: “There is excitement over the players he’s brought in, and they looked good, but I thought De Ligt was excellent. It was probably his best game in a United shirt, with the ball and defending.\"",
      "De Ligt was also outstanding when he played Arsenal at the Emirates in January, making important blocks and recovering from an improbable position to deny Leandro Trossard a tap-in.",
      "And when the 26-year-old spoke in pre-season, it was interesting to hear him promise there was more to come in the new campaign",
      "\"Sometimes me and other football fans forget my age,\" he said. \"And as a centre-back you’re normally in your prime at 28 or 29, so in that way, I’m still quite young. Personally, I’d love to carry on from how I was in March, April – I feel that is the level I could show and should show on a consistent basis.",
      "\"That’s my personal goal, and also to stay fit, that is really important. And then the goal with the team is to really show everybody what it is to play for United, and to get a positive vibe again around the team and the club.\"",
      "This season is important for De Ligt's future at Old Trafford. Jason Wilcox (director of football) will reportedly only make a solid assessment of a player after they have been afforded two seasons at United.",
      "That would be a logical approach because new signings should be given a season to settle into their new surroundings.",
      "De Ligt has spent 12 months in Manchester and his arrival coincided with the worst season at United for 51 years, so it was difficult for him to give the best account of himself.",
      "The good news is De Ligt made an impressive start to the new campaign against Arsenal on Sunday. Long may his that continue because United must qualify for European competition this season.",
      "Building a robust defensive foundation will be key to achieving that target, and centre-back is a strong area at United when Amorim's options are injury-free and available for selection.",
      "De Ligt, Yoro, Shaw, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are good options for the three starting positions. Shaw started on the left of the defence against Arsenal, but Martinez (currently recovering from a knee injury) and Heaven are also both best on that side.",
      "Yoro has the right side nailed down and it feels like the central role is between De Ligt and Maguire.",
      "Maguire might struggle to get back into the team if De Ligt consistently performs like he did against Arsenal.",

      "Sport Central Audience Writer",
      "Manchester United are back in action when they travel to Fulham on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's side may well have lost their Premier League curtain-raiser - falling to a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal - but there were plenty of positives for the Reds to take from the performance moving forward.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were both impressive - on debut - while the back-three didn't put much of a foot wrong against a strong Arsenal XI. Riccardo Calafiori proved to be the match-winner, although second-choice goalkeeper Altay Bayindir would have been frustrated with his role in the goal.",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Craven Cottage this weekend. Marco Silva's side kicked off their campaign with a 1-1 draw against Brighton on Saturday, with Rodrigo Muniz scoring a stoppage-time equaliser for the Whites.",
      "In the meantime, United could be active in the market looking to strengthen up their squad, with a new midfielder and a goalkeeper set be their main areas to target.",
      "Manchester United are fearful that meeting Sporting CP's demands for Morten Hjulmand before the end of the window might impact their plans to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton next summer, according to GIVEMESPORT.",
      "Influential figures behind-the-scenes are hestitating about whether or not they should enter negotiations with Sporting or focus on alternative targets.",
      "Hjulmand has a release clause in the region of £69million in his contract. While United could trigger that and sign the Denmark international, they do not want to eat into their budget for next year.",
      "United are, therefore, aware that spending big to land Hjulmand may harm their bid to land Baleba in 12 months time, for example.",
      "Not to say that Baleba wouldn't slot straight into United's midfield now, but if they have to wait another year to sign him, they should do that rather than scuppering their chances by bringing Hjulmand in.",
      "Having accepted they did not have the funds to sign Carlos Baleba, it looks as though Manchester United have - potentially - identified a much cheaper alternative.",
      "According to Orgullobiri Sevilla, via Sport Witness, United are going for Lucien Agoume. He has a £35million release clause in his Sevilla contract and, while the La Liga side are willing to accept a lower offer, they will not let him leave for less than £26million. The report has stated that 'Manchester United are coming' - but it's also stated that other unnamed Premier League clubs are interested.",
      "If that is the case - and United can get Agoume this summer and Baleba in 2026 - then the Reds should do that. It would be an astute piece of business, as Agoume can strengthen United's midfield from the get-go.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "14=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "7) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "6) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (albeit since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which still feels entirely possible because surely not everyone is as bad as Brentford – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list."

      "Manchester United are ‘accelerating’ to secure the signing of Lucien Agoume from Sevilla after Ruben Amorim ‘failed to convince’ the Red Devils board to sign an Aston Villa star.",
      "United have already spent around £200m this summer, with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joining the club to form an entirely new front three, with left-back Diego Leon also arriving to bolster Amorim’s options.",
      "But the Portuguese boss is also keen on adding a new midfielder to his ranks, and having walked away from a possible deal for Carlos Baleba having decided they couldn’t stump up the £100m Brighton are asking for, Spanish outlet Fichajes claim they’re ramping up their efforts to sign Agoume.",
      "The report states that United are joined by two further Premier League clubs in ‘probing the situation’, but the Red Devils are ‘in the lead thanks to the insistence of their coaching staff’.",
      "The 23-year-old has a release clause of £35m but it’s thought he could make the move to the Premier League for as little as £21m.",
      "A Sevilla executive commented privately that “the arrival of offers from England forces the club to listen,” reflecting the growing expectation about a possible transfer, with the La Liga club ‘seeing the sale of Agouti as a strategic option to clean up their accounts and make room for new signings’.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 Garnacho ‘Pr*ck Protection’ grants perfect transfer compromise for Man Utd and Chelsea\n👉 Man Utd fans told they have the next Darwin Nunez as stinging verdict of £74m signing dropped\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘His physical display, tactical reading and ability to move the ball under pressure make him a modern profile, with characteristics similar to those demanded by English football. In addition, it is considered that personal conditions will not be an obstacle, since the Frenchman is open to transfer.",
      "‘In the footballer’s environment, they recognize that the Premier League is a league that has seduced him for a long time, and his time at Sevilla could be just a step towards a career of greater international projection.’",
      "United have also been heavily linked with new goalkeepers this summer despite Amorim’s insistence after Altay Bayindir’s mistake in the 1-0 defeat to Arsenal that he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” he has at his disposal.",
      "Dropping Andre Onana for that clash would suggest he’s not entirely happy, and amid links with PSG wantaway Gianluigi Donnarumma, Argentinian outlet TyC Sports claim the United board denied Amorim when he asked them to make a move for Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez earlier in the window.",
      "It’s claimed the World Cup winner’s ‘switch to Old Trafford was very close’ but that Amorim failed to convince the hierarchy to invest heavily in another goalkeeper while Onana remains under contract, leaving them willing only to authorise a temporary deal’.",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim “could not convince” Manchester United to “spend on a good goalkeeper” after the head coach requested a preferred target.",
      "Ruben Amorim is already in a battle to keep his job at Manchester United; they cannot finish outside the top six.",
      "Ruben Amorim has had his first rant of the season after a reporter suggested Tom Heaton would have been a better choice between the sticks.",
      "Ruben Amorim insists he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” at Man Utd and defended Altay Bayindir after his blunder saw them lose to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been criticised for a “terrible substitution” in Man Utd’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday.",

      "The truth is at this level, all the best clubs have great players. Liverpool have great players, City etc. What truly separates elite teams from great teams is having players who can turn nothing into something. This is what KDB did for years and what Salah is doing now.\nUnpredictability is what wins you titles. Arteta has built a great team no doubt. Time to take the next step. To be honest, it’s why Man Utd looked dangerous in certain spells on Sunday. When you have players like Bruno, Cunha and Mbuemo, you have players who can come up with moments from nothing. These players transcend coaching and tactics. You just tell them to go out there and do what they do.",
      "The one piece of bad news is Havertz’s injury. Havertz suits certain games and is the number one reason Arsenal are compact and so hard to break down. PSG’s goal at the emirates never gets scored if Havertz was on the pitch. This is one area Gyokeres must adapt. His pressing is often disjointed and not rhythmic with the rest of the team. Yes, I know he was not bought to press but it’s a joy to watch Odegaard and Havertz lead the press.",

The article talks about the two goals he scored against Champions League winners PSG in the CWC final, the last competitive game Palmer played before the Palace game. I know everyone scoffs at it but obliterating the Champions League winners at any point is an achievement and Palmer was magnificent, Tosin also said on instagram that Palmer told him he was not leaving empty handed that night and the man delivered.",
      "The article then goes straight into talking about his goal drought being a problem which is a little strange to do after talking about him scoring twice in his last competitive game. I hardly think a poor performance by Palmer against a Palace team that beat Liverpool and Man City in their last two fixtures is much to worry about.",
      "It feels like things are beginning to come together slowly, there have been plenty of positives. I think most Chelsea fans will still be massively optimistic that when this team clicks we can beat anyone and Palmer is almost certainly going to play a key role in that.

      "Yet, for some reason, no one is questioning why these particular players who are clearly good enough for higher achieving clubs are allowed to leave at all let alone so cheaply. Why questions aren’t being asked about how the club is managing the talents recruited, and holding those in charge to account. What exactly is the Director of Football – appointed to ensure recruitment and retention was consistent and long-term, no matter the manager – doing? Is it enough for the Head Coach (note, not manager) to “not fancy” a player?",
      "In the backdrop of this, we see Mainoo and last year’s small glimmer of light – Amad – continue to be marginalised. We’ve seen players who have already stepped up and do well previously be sent packing on loan at a time we’re also talking about spunking £60m on an Amorim favourite from his old club (wasn’t there some rule about that?) or £100m on another. Maybe it’s just me, and I think Baleba looks like an amazing player, but isn’t that *exactly* like buying Mbappe rather than developing the next one?",
      "Maybe this will all work out and those players will be integrated as part of some amazing master plan that leads to success. A partnership of Baleba and Mainoo certainly would be dreamy. But it’s hard not get a concerned feeling considering our repeated failure to not just retain top talents but actively and intentionally drive them out before replacing them at great expense that now leaves us starting with a midfield of a guy who can’t run and a guy playing out of position and fundamentally unsuited, both of whom are on the downward slope of their careers (albeit at different stages).",

      "Man Utd v Arsenal: Considered views\nAll in the media (and many in the mailbox) seem focused on the narrative of what is (still) wrong with United. I would have thought given Arsenal’s status as champions in the waiting – United gave a pretty good account of themselves. If Bayandir keeps out that goal, the game would have a very different feel. If Dorgu’s shot goes in of the post and United win 1-0 – maybe we’d be talking about United as possible top 5 teams in the kneejerk section. Fine margins eh?",
      "We’ll only know after a few more games whether Arsenal were poor or they were just outplayed by a surprisingly robust United side. There seems to be a huge stampede in the media to suggest that Arsenal should get credit for winning the game despite having a bad game. But perhaps United made Arsenal look average. After all – we were told that Arsenal have now corrected the only issues left for them to really challenge for the title. I see people handing out kudos for Zubimendi and Saliba, neither of them outperformed their united counterparts.",
      "There are those (including some writers on this site) who maintain that United’s midfield sucks. Time will tell. They feel that Fernandes is not suited for this role. They’re probably the same people praising Slot for converting Gravenberch to a different role. Or that there’s really no difference between United last year and this year. Actually, anybody who feels that this is the same United as last year either hasn’t watched United enough or worse – doesn’t really understand football. (And yes the irony should not be lost that after the weekend we are still 15th!)",
      "Despite the result, I was very happy after the game (which I watched in a bar in Rome). It wasn’t perfect by any means. But I was expecting a backs to the wall performance from United. Instead it was the other way around. We dominated possession, chances, and territory. We conceded less fouls and cards. And lost by a goal that on another day another ref may have called a foul.",
      "Arsenal were very good last year for much of the season. And United were pretty crap through it. People tend to assume continuity across seasons. So any data that counters this trend will be deemed an anomaly or people will find all manner of explanations as to why it looked like United were the better team by a distance. But of course we also know that United have played well against the big teams last season as well so United’s games against Fulham and Burney will ironically tell us whether Arsenal should be lauded for winning ugly or considered just lucky. As much as they’ll tell us whether United are a different proposition this year.\nVed Sen (MUFC)",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Arsenal\nThe Sun reckons Arsenal were already monitoring Rogers before Havertz’s knee knack but the German’s injury has focused the Gunners’ mind on the Villa star, even after securing Eze. That being true, you would expect Villa to offer stubborn resistance, unless Arsenal come with silly money. Nope.",

      "",
      "19) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind.",
      "",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nBack on the agenda after the winger remained an unused substitute in Real’s La Liga opener. City are keen, but only if Tottenham take Savinho. Which few at the Etihad were convinced is a wise idea, but Spurs might not come a little more forcibly once they have wiped the Eze custard from their chops. So to speak.",
      "",
      "16) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nYou can’t blame Chelsea for trying to maximise the fee they eventually bank for Jackson but £80million is just daft. It does, however, make £60million sound more palatable to the likes of Villa and Newcastle, who are more motivated to move as the deadline approaches. Villa are said to be looking at a loan-to-buy deal, which could still cost them a total of £70million. Which seems awfully steep for a one-goal-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly have little use for.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which might have scuppered whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane, but that hasn’t stopped them from talking it over with United on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, perhaps we can expect some movement here since Spurs fans are fuming once more.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will want big money since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million. Maybe the performance at Leeds will persuade Everton to pay up.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. After the Instagram tantrum, we wait in anticipation of Wissa’s next move.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million but at least they seem tohave warmed to the idea of taking back Christopher Nkunku. Which would free up some of the funds to sign Simons.",
      "",
      "8) ↔ Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, which they have not yet shown a firm desire to do. If Liverpool had not taken Hugo Ekitike from under Newcastle’s noses, Isak would quite likely be in red by now. He’s not, and while we won’t rule out the prospect of Liverpool going big, it’s no more likely to happen than it was before Isak hit ‘share’ on his Instagram story.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "7) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed. If only there was another club in Manchester who desperately need a competent goalkeeper…",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nCity say Ederson stayed in Manchester rather than travel to Wolves last Saturday because he had a dicky tummy. It was just a coincidence that it occurred around the same time an £8.6million offer arrived from Galatasaray. If City have decided they want Donnarumma, then Ederson will be off. They want double the amount offered by the Turkish but the expectation is that a compromise can be reached. Galatasaray tried to speed City along by making it known they quite fancy Diogo Costa too, but it doesn;t seem to have had the desired effect.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get id. RB Leipzig’s renewed interest could give Bayern the shove they need.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Douglas Luiz – Juventus to Nottingham Forest\nForest have seemingly only recently realised that the transfer window is open, with the former Aston Villa captain their top midfield target now their attack is sufficiently strengthened. The Brazilian has been pants in Italy but his performances for Villa are still fresh enough in the memory to believe that this could be a fine addition. Ornstein reckons a deal is agreed for Forest to take Luiz on loan for a season before a £25million obligation if he plays a specified number of games. Which seems like a very sweet deal for Forest. Luiz is likely to have a medical on Thursday.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nWoah! Eze to Arsenal had been shunted from the top 20, with the Tottenham rumour placing as high as no.3 on Wednesday. However, Tottenham missed their window, opened for them by Arsenal’s original faffing. It seems that just as Spurs were about to do the deal, back came Arsenal, prompted by Kai Havertz’s injury and since the feeling always was that Eze would prefer the Gunners, to the Emirates he will go for a package worth £60million in front and around £7.5million in add-ons. But only after his involvement in Palace’s Conference League tie on Thursday night. Are there any Spurs fans in the Fredrikstad XI?",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noah Okafor – AC Milan to Leeds United\nLeeds have reached a deal with Milan worth £18million including add-ons for the forward, with a four-year contract on the table. Okafor offers versatility and Leeds can offer game time to a player with only 11 Serie A starts in the last two seasons with Milan and Napoli. The 25-year-old is in God’s Own County for a medical.",
      "",
      "When Alexander Isak is trending and you’re not based in Liverpool or Newcastle, just make up some nonsense…",
      "We’re trying to avoid Alexander Isak in this Mailbox so we start with Eberechi Eze and see where we go from there…",
      "We have a PFA Team of the Year XI made up of players who have been included at least five times in the Premier League era.",
      "Eberechi Eze will remain loved by the vast majority of Crystal Palace fans; he did things very differently to Alexander Isak.",
      "Arsenal have beaten Tottenham to Eberechi Eze, but a move billed as a hijacking had actually been made long before Spurs struck a deal for the playmaker.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’."

      "Mo Salah became the first ever player to win the PFA Player of the Year three times after picking up the award on Tuesday night and the ceremony also marked the Egyptian’s inclusion in the Team of the Year for the fourth time.",
      "Salah is among the favourites for the PFA Player of the Year award for 2025/26.",
      "There are a some iconic names who’ve been picked more than the Liverpool hero, including one of his team-mates. Here’s an XI made up from players who’ve been selected for the PFA Team of the Year on five occasions or more in the Premier League era.",
      "",
      "Goalkeeper: David De Gea\nYou’d be hard pressed to find a Manchester United fan who rates David De Gea higher than Peter Schmeichel (one inclusion) or Edwin van der Sar (three inclusions), but the current Fiorentina stopper was a rare gem in the bleak post-Fergie years at Old Trafford, warranting selection five times. If you fancy a goalkeeper challenge, try naming the keeper with the most appearances in the top flight TOTY since its inception in the 1973/74 season.",
      "",
      "Defender: Gary Neville\nAlthough seemingly quite content to laugh at himself when others play down his talents, Gary Neville must’ve been doing something right considering he was selected by his peers as the best right-back in the Premier League on six occasions. The only full-back to feature more often in the top tier’s Team of the Year is Arsenal and Crystal Palace legend Kenny Sansom with eight.",
      "",
      "Defender: Rio Ferdinand\nNeville’s former Manchester United team-mate also makes this side, having been selected six times. His first inclusion came with Leeds United in 2001/02, before a big money move to Old Trafford saw him become a TOTY regular, lining up alongside centre-back partner Nemanja Vidic three times in the Premier League’s best XI.",
      "",
      "Defender: Virgil van Dijk\nVirgil van Dijk’s inclusion on Tuesday night sees him stay one clear of Salah. However, the Liverpool captain needs to be selected one more time to equal Anfield legend Alan Hansen’s record of six. Van Dijk remains just one of three defenders to win the individual award in the Premier League era, standing tall alongside Paul McGrath and John Terry, with Gary Pallister picking up the gong in the last ever First Division campaign of 1991/92.",
      "",
      "Right wing: Cristiano Ronaldo\nSeven full seasons in English football and selected for the PFA Team of the Year in five of them, with his final inclusion coming in his late thirties. Cristiano Ronaldo would have surely broken all the individual and team records if he didn’t swap Manchester for Madrid, but thankfully the PFA awards remain far more diverse than the Ballon d’Or circa 2008 to 2017.",
      "",
      "Central midfield: Patrick Vieira\nPatrick Vieira’s impressive six selections in nine years at Arsenal sees him make this team, with the French midfielder often lining up alongside fierce rival Roy Keane in the best Premier League side of the season. Keane may have won the war when it came to league titles, but Vieira won the PFA Team of the Year battle, with one more inclusion than the Irishman.",
      "",
      "Central midfield: Kevin De Bruyne\nNow playing in the blue of Napoli instead of Manchester City, Kevin De Bruyne’s fifth and final TOTY inclusion came in the Citizens’ treble-winning season of 2022/23. Five of the Premier League’s best XI came from the Etihad that year, in a repeat of 1998/99, when the same number of Manchester United players appeared as the Red Devils battled their way to glory at home and abroad.",
      "READ: Top 10 Premier League teams of all time has new entrant in Man City 22/23",
      "",
      "Central midfield: Steven Gerrard\nWith eight PFA Team of the Year selections, Steven Gerrard has more than Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes combined. Does that put the debate to bed? Probably not.",
      "",
      "Left wing: Ryan Giggs\nThe fifth and final Manchester United legend in this elite XI, Ryan Giggs was a member of the first TOTY of the Premier League era and won the Young Player of the Year award in the same season. Sixteen years later the Welsh wizard made his sixth and final appearance in the top flight’s best XI whilst also lifting the big individual award in 2008/09.",
      "",
      "Striker: Harry Kane\nIt is of course very Spursy that Harry Kane was selected for the PFA Team of the Year six times without winning the Player of the Year, whilst also standing out as the only man in this side not to lift a league title or cup in at least one of the seasons he was selected in. But he’s got his Bundesliga medal now and Tottenham have dusted down their trophy cabinet for the Europa League, so all is well.",
      "",
      "Striker: Thierry Henry\nLast but not least, arguably the Premier League’s greatest ever player. Thierry Henry was selected for TOTY six times in a row at the start of the millennium and won Player of the Year award twice during those years. Despite that success in England, the Highbury hero missed out on the Ballon d’Or at his peak, finishing as runner-up to Pavel Nedved in 2003.",
      "When Alexander Isak is trending and you’re not based in Liverpool or Newcastle, just make up some nonsense…",

      "Eberechi Eze will remain loved by the vast majority of Crystal Palace fans; he did things very differently to Alexander Isak.",
      "Arsenal have beaten Tottenham to Eberechi Eze, but a move billed as a hijacking had actually been made long before Spurs struck a deal for the playmaker.",

      "Manchester United see £50m for Alejandro Garnacho as a ‘fair and accurate’ price, while Chelsea don’t want to pay more than £30m. Neither club is wrong – both valuations are entirely reasonable. Which is why rather than meeting in the middle to leave both United and Chelsea £10m unhappy, we propose a significant level of Pr*ck Protection to ensure the perfect transfer.",
      "Chelsea are in an excellent negotiating position. Garnacho is a desire rather than a need; if they don’t get him, they’ll either sign someone else or no-one at all and be just fine. He’s desperate to join them, with his ‘Chelsea or nothing’ vow tested and affirmed this week as he said no to Bayern Munich. And United are obviously very open to offers for a man who’s played his last game for them.",
      "The smart money would be on United lowering their price tag to bring in some of that sweet ‘pure profit’ cash to aid in the PSR stakes and perhaps put towards a new midfielder or goalkeeper.",
      "But there must be more than a temptation – after Garnacho told them “Chelsea or I stay here and don’t play football for 6-12 months” – for the United bosses to test that resolve given his off-field antics this summer.",
      "He’s only on £50,000 per week; they might see £2.6m as an annual price they’re willing to pay for the cathartic suffering of their academy graduate. If we’re making knee-jerk assessments on the opening day of the season – and of course we are – United will be just fine without further additions while Garnacho rots at home.",
      "And just imagine the malicious joy Ruben Amorim would take in Garnacho coming to his office in October with his tale between his legs asking him to play football in a World Cup year. “Still got the Marcus Rashford shirt, mate? Yeah, shut the door on your way out.”",
      "Between his donning of that Aston Villa top, labelling United’s season “sh*t” after being dropped for the Europa League final and spending most of their post-season trip of Asia ‘flipping the finger to fans’, supposedly in jest, Garnacho didn’t leave much space for reintegration after Amorim informed him he wasn’t in his plans.",
      "It does make you wonder just how much of a childish little arse a talented footballer has to be for other clubs not to be interested in signing them at all, though our guess is there will always be a manager with an ego big enough to believe they can be the ‘fix’ for a lost soul no matter what they’ve done, within the boundaries of the law.",
      "Enzo Maresca isn’t alone in thinking Garnacho’s quality and potential outstrips his infantile behaviour, with Aston Villa’s Unai Emery and Bayern’s Vincent Kompany seemingly of a similar mind.",
      "And Chelsea’s belief that the 21-year-old can become a ‘key player in the right environment’ isn’t without reason. Although their own experience with Jadon Sancho suggests Stamford Bridge perhaps isn’t the best landing spot for Red Devil outcasts, fellow bomb squad members Rashford and Antony both thrived having escaped United last season.",
      "Chelsea only sign footballers they believe will be worth more than what they paid for them in the future. It’s a model we scoffed at but is now reaping rewards. And there’s no doubt that Garnacho represents a big market opportunity.",
      "It was barely a year ago that United deemed him untouchable as a £100m player in the making, before setting a £70m asking price that’s now dropped to £50m. That dip in valuation is thanks to what we’ve been told is a need for the club to make money through player sales, a lack of progression on Garnacho’s part in that time, his unsuitability to Amorim’s system and United’s bizarre bid to secure the lowest possible transfer fee for their footballers by telling the world they’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "We would suggest – and this may well be Chelsea’s position – there has been no allowance made by United for just what a knob he’s been in the last three months. And thus we present to you: Pr*ck Protection.",
      "The issue we foresee in Chelsea drawing up a contract which includes this £20m-worth of Pr*ck Protection, or add-ons as they’re more colloquially known, is the subjectivity of pr*ckery. We’ve all met several pr*cks in our lives and often what makes them a pr*ck is intangible – it’s something you feel in your bones. “Why don’t I like them? Don’t know, just a bit of a pr*ck.”",
      "And even the things that could possibly be measured – number of social media posts involving you wearing the shirt of a rival club, a sulk to goals ratio, volume of bullsh*t spouted on your behalf by your loud-mouthed sibling – aren’t typically the things written into a contract, with add-ons tending to be based on players achievements rather than stuff they’ve managed to avoid.",
      "Chelsea may have to rely on the usual appearances, goals, assists bonuses to serve a similar purpose – Maresca won’t pick a pr*ck  – but in whatever guise, they will feel they should be afforded some insurance from United: financial recognition of the risk they’re taking on a player who probably is worth £50m, but only if he stops being a pr*ck.",
      "When Alexander Isak is trending and you’re not based in Liverpool or Newcastle, just make up some nonsense…",
      "We’re trying to avoid Alexander Isak in this Mailbox so we start with Eberechi Eze and see where we go from there…",

      "We are one gameweek down and with less than two weeks until the transfer window closes, plenty of Premier League clubs have some glaring holes in their squads.",
      "From goalkeepers flapping at corners to £27m strikers managing two shots, here are seven much-needed transfers highlighted by the opening weekend.",
      "On another day, Altay Bayindir may well have got the free-kick he was asking for having flapped at the ball for Arsenal’s goal but his performance shone a spotlight on United’s most pressing need: a new goalkeeper.",
      "Even in the dark years, United have tended to have decent shot-stoppers with David de Gea carrying the team for a number of seasons, but his replacement Andre Onana and his deputy Bayindir do not inspire confidence.",
      "Fixing that problem is key and the club have been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emi Martinez, both of who would be upgrades on their current options.",
      "Away from the keeper, United also need a new midfielder with 33-year-old Casemiro looking past his best. Adam Wharton would be the best replacement but it may be hard to convince Crystal Palace to sell with Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi likely to leave before the window closes.",
      "The headband-wearing Antony Gordon’s impression of Bjorn Borg was better than his impression of a No.9 against Aston Villa as Newcastle looked particularly toothless up front.",
      "Alexander Isak being the clear first choice meant Newcastle have had the luxury of not needing to spend too much time thinking about squad depth but this summer has proved just how hard it can be to secure the top striking talents.",
      "Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko have both gone elsewhere with Isak sulking in an unknown location, leaving Gordon to try to impose himself on opposition defences.",
      "The result was an expected one. All but one of his shots inside the box were blocked and of his seven efforts, just two hit the target. Crucially, they were efforts taken outside the box and to the left, his more natural position.",
      "With Isak in the wilderness and Callum Wilson now at West Ham, Newcastle need to get a striker in and, even if PSR will prevent getting a replacement close to Isak’s level, anything is better than nothing at this stage.",
      "A 3-0 win to start the year suggested Tottenham may not miss the creativity of James Maddison following his long-term injury but they will come up against far better opposition than Burnley this season.",
      "Against the Turf Moor side, Thomas Frank started a very young midfield of Lucas Bergvall, Archie Gray and Pape Sarr but as the season goes on and tougher games take place, you get the feeling they could do with some more experience in there.",
      "The obvious link is Eze who has been reported as ‘one step away’ from signing with the north London club but with Yves Bissouma looking like he may leave, Spurs could do with even more reinforcements than just the Palace man.",

      "Monday’s loss to Leeds United was a humbling way for Everton fans to start what was supposed to be a season of positivity.",
      "A brand new stadium may soon be filled with the same existential dread that painted the walls of Goodison and while it is easy to answer the question with ‘How do you fix Everton?’ by replying ‘Get a whole new team’, realistically, they should focus on the forward department.",
      "Their back line is solid and would have kept a clean sheet had a harsh VAR call not gone their way while the summer reinforcements of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish look like smart acquisitions, but it is the No.9 spot that Everton have struggled with for years.",
      "The perennially injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin has joined Monday’s opponents and while Beto scored five in five back in February, a run of eight games without a goal is perhaps more representative.",
      "Against Leeds, the Guinea-Bissau international registered the fewest touches of any player to last the full 90 and managed just one shot. The fact he played the whole game only demonstrates how hamstrung David Moyes is in that area. New signing Thierno Barry was only trusted for a few minutes.",
      "The Toffees have been linked with Reims forward Adama Bojang and out-of-contract Jamie Vardy but Moyes needs something if they are to avoid the drop this year.",
      "Where to even begin?",
      "If West Ham fans were not already worried, a 3-0 thumping at the hands of newly promoted Sunderland was enough to send even the calmest head into panic mode.",
      "The weakness of last season’s promoted teams and the laughable chaos at Spurs and United allowed West Ham to reach the flattering spot of 14th but it is already looking like it would need a miracle for them to do so again this time round.",
      "Their xG against the Black Cats was only better than Wolves (who played Manchester City) and Villa (who played Newcastle with 10 men). At the other end, the xG conceded was not awful at 0.8 but the team look so toothless going forward as the tactic of ‘pass the ball to Bowen and hope for the best’ reaches its limit.",
      "The worst offender was Niclas Fullkrug who managed just two shots in the full 90 minutes and lost all but three of his 19 duels. The decision to sign him for £27m only a year ago now fits neatly into West Ham’s woes with strikers.",
      "The Hammers are said to be competing with Everton for Bojang but it is hard to see why any player would choose this ‘project’ at the moment.",
      "If it continues like this, West Ham’s most important signing may well be a new manager.",
      "For a team that had eight goalkeepers on their books only a year ago, Chelsea sure have found it difficult to find a decent one.",
      "In Chelsea’s 0-0 draw to Palace, a technicality saved Robert Sanchez from conceding a free-kick he really should have stopped and although he came away with a clean sheet, he only had to make four saves with Palace’s total xG at only 0.66.",
      "Tougher tests will come but Sanchez is not a keeper that inspires a huge amount of confidence. Despite this, the club insist hey are not in the market for a new shot-stopper. The fools.",
      "When your own manager is describing your transfer window as “passive”, not much more needs to be said.",
      "Fulham owners the Khans have typically been late spenders but Fulham have parted with less than £500k this summer. Five League One clubs have spent more than that.",
      "Marco Silva wants four new signings before the window closes but it should be in creative areas that the club focus on.",
      "Away at Brighton, they created just one big chance and had an xG of 0.76 and next face the visit of Manchester United.",
      "",
      "When Alexander Isak is trending and you’re not based in Liverpool or Newcastle, just make up some nonsense…",

      "Arsenal want Morgan Rogers after securing Eberechi Eze, do they? Tottenham could channel their frustration towards Manchester City…",
      "We have a PFA Team of the Year XI made up of players who have been included at least five times in the Premier League era.",
      "Eberechi Eze will remain loved by the vast majority of Crystal Palace fans; he did things very differently to Alexander Isak.",
      "Arsenal have beaten Tottenham to Eberechi Eze, but a move billed as a hijacking had actually been made long before Spurs struck a deal for the playmaker."

      "Manchester United could be forced into a late U-turn over Jadon Sancho as the winger’s stance on a September deadline threatens to complicate Ruben Amorim’s transfer window.",
      "Sancho has been deemed surplus to requirements this summer, with United making clear they want him gone before the market closes.",
      "His contract, worth upwards of £250,000 per week, has only added urgency as the club looks to free space on the wage bill and raise funds for reinforcements.",
      "United have already invested heavily in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, so any extra relief they can generate by moving Sancho on and securing a fee could be vital in funding further late-window business.",
      "The 25-year-old has already shown he is in no rush to leave. United accepted a £17m bid from Roma, but Sancho rejected the move and instructed his agent to turn it down.",
      "Other approaches have also been dismissed, with Amorim unwilling to reintegrate him regardless of how long he remains at Old Trafford.",
      "That backdrop leaves United desperate for a resolution before September 1.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, however, Sancho is more relaxed about the deadline. The winger is prepared to wait beyond this window if the right permanent opportunity does not emerge and would even consider reassessing his options in January.",
      "That stance is designed to protect his long-term future, with Sancho conscious that he could secure a stronger move if he holds his ground.",
      "But it collides directly with United’s urgency to close the door now and stop one of their highest earners drifting through the autumn without a role.",
      "The concern for United’s hierarchy is that Sancho’s patience forces their hand. They may be left with little choice but to sanction a loan on deadline day, knowing that a permanent fee looks unlikely unless he changes his position.",
      "For Amorim, the timing could not be worse. United’s manager has already moved Marcus Rashford on to Barcelona and wants the chance to reshape his squad with fresh signings before the window shuts.",

      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim “could not convince” Manchester United to “spend on a good goalkeeper” after the head coach requested a preferred target.",
      "For most of this summer, Man Utd have been focused on overhauling their attack and they have sealed deals for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to sit as the third-biggest spenders in this window.",
      "These players made a positive impact against Arsenal on Sunday, so there are signs that the Red Devils will be more dangerous in attack this season.",
      "Still, Amorim‘s side need reinforcements in other positions and it’s been widely reported that their current priority is to sign a new goalkeeper and centre-midfielder.",
      "The lack of outgoings are impacting their plans, but the absence of Andre Onana and the poor mistake made by Alter Bayindir exposed their clear need to land an upgrade between the sticks.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘to invest’ £130m to ‘close’ next ‘two signings’ amid ‘bombshell proposal’ for Real Madrid star",
      "£40m-rated Emiliano Martinez has been heavily linked with Man Utd and it has been suggested that Aston Villa are open to his exit as they look to ease their PSR issues.",
      "A report from journalist Gaston Edul claims Amorim made it clear to Man Utd chiefs that he “wanted” Martinez, but they made a weak attempt to sign him and this deal is currently looking unlikely.",
      "“The deal was very close (Emi Martinez to Manchester United),” Edul said on the 412 YouTube channel.",
      "“The coaching staff, especially Amorim, wanted him, and Martinez knew that Amorim wanted him.",
      "“Amorim could not convince the United board that it was important to spend on a good goalkeeper.",
      "“Well, they told him that Onana was there and said, ‘OK, we’ll do you a favour and try,’ and they offered a loan. Aston Villa made it clear under what conditions they would let him go for a sale.”",
      "As mentioned, outgoings will be key to Man Utd’s hopes of securing more signings and transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided a detailed update on four potential departures.",
      "“Man Utd are pushing Jadon Sancho to find the solution as soon as possible,” Romano revealed.",
      "“Sancho and Roma deal was on for £20 million. On Monday, Sancho said ‘no’ to that possibility.",
      "“For Man Utd there are some players who are completely out of the squad. Internally they describe that as a bomb squad – those who are completely out of the project: Sancho, Antony, Real Betis are still interested but there could be other clubs, and Alejandro Garnacho, who is expected to join Chelsea.",
      "“Tyrell Malacia is also not part of the project, and Roma and Besikas are the two clubs interested.",
      "“At Man Utd there is movement for these players because it’s going to be important to find new solutions on the market.",
      "“For Sancho, Man Utd have been clear with the player. They want a solution as soon as possible because his salary is a big part of the Financial Fair Play position for Man Utd.",
      "“So it’s going to be important to see what’s going to happen there for sure as Man Utd were really ready and prepared to welcome a £20m loan with an obligation to buy almost guaranteed from Roma.”",
      "Manchester United are ‘accelerating’ to secure a £35m midfielder after Ruben Amorim ‘failed to convince’ the Red Devils board to sign an Aston Villa star.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville reckons his former club have a “glaring issue” that “can’t be ignored” as they should sign a Premier League star.",
      "Ruben Amorim insists he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” at Man Utd and defended Altay Bayindir after his blunder saw them lose to Arsenal on Sunday."

      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",

      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £148.1m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",

      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Sunderland) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",
      "5th (Nottingham Forest) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Arsenal) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Leeds) – £37.1m",

      "11th (Chelsea) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Crystal Palace) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Newcastle) – £21.2m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "",
      "10) Liverpool will break the goal record\nArne Slot basically telling Jamie Carragher to support a different team if he was “worried” about Liverpool committing too many players forward in a 4-2 win was enjoyable.",
      "“We are a team that likes to attack. We are a team that wants to score goals,” he said, as if adding a £69m striker and £100m playmaker to a group of options also including the third-highest scorer in the club’s history had not already underlined, italicised and emboldened the point.",
      "It did make the £150m record pursuit of another forward seem like a bit of a luxury but Liverpool are blessed with quality rather than quantity across their frontline. Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez and Ben Doak have been sold for almost as much as Alexander Isak would cost.",
      "Another ingredient might well be added to the mix before the deadline but even without it, the 106-goal platter Manchester City delivered the first Pep Guardiola title on should be a tentative target.",
      "",
      "9) At least one of the four out-of-contract managers announce their exit before the end of the season\nBournemouth and Wolves were beaten by Premier League title challengers, while Crystal Palace and Fulham emerged from difficult away assignments with creditable draws.",
      "That only reinforced the frustration felt by three of those four desirable Premier League coaches in the final year of their deals.",
      "Andoni Iraola has since been endowed with an overdue centre-half and attacking depth in Bafode Diakite and Ben Gannon-Doak. But Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva and Vitor Pereira have all reiterated the need for new and ready-made signings.",
      "Perhaps the clubs involved would prefer a more long-term show of commitment from those who expect to be supplied expensive new toys, but each of those managers could feasibly punch a little higher in their relationships.",
      "",
      "8) Parker and Potter are sacked\nIt is a point worth repeating from the first Winners and Losers of the season: bemoaning an inability to do “the basics” against a newly-promoted side or blaming “fine margins” as a newly-promoted side, both in 3-0 defeats, does not augur well on the opening weekend.",
      "Burnley might have expected to be in for a long season and Scott Parker deserves credit for taking a different approach to his latest bid for survival. But this one looked roughly as doomed as his previous attempts even before a ball was kicked.",
      "Graham Potter was an early sack race frontrunner after the general misery with which last season ended at West Ham, and such a chastening defeat to Sunderland meant the wait for any semblance of an identity to emerge under his tutelage has reached 20 games and a pre-season.",
      "The recruitment has not been nearly good enough for either club to achieve their objectives, but ultimately two managers who have suffered their fair share of sackings know where the buck stops for fidgety owners. The race to appoint Sean Dyche will be unseemly.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds and Sunderland will stay up\nFor the first time since 2021/22, and only the third time ever in Premier League history, as many as two newly-promoted teams won on the opening weekend.",
      "The scorelines were slightly different for Sunderland and Leeds, the first Championship winners to start in the top flight with a win since the Black Cats in 2007. But both overcame established members of what has proven a particularly closed shop in the past couple of seasons.",
      "There has been a slight overegging of the pudding in terms of fretting about the gulf between the Premier League and Football League based on six laughably underprepared and low-quality sides coming up to go straight down – especially as the four most recent sides to survive that jump seamlessly became part of the apparently unmovable furniture.",
      "But in sinking those early six-pointers, leaving a mark on teams they can feasibly usurp and building momentum in front of raucous home crowds after solid to spectacular summer recruitment drives, Sunderland and Leeds have already shown enough to suggest they can hold their own.",
      "",
      "6) Brentford will go down\nThat does require the demise of two supposedly protected and untouchable teams, but Brentford always felt unsuited to that elite casting and the vultures have done a number on them.",
      "Dango Ouattara has signed, Mikkel Damsgaard will return and Jordan Henderson should bring experience and nous to a team suddenly lacking in both, but it is difficult to envisage Keith Andrews making much sense of the hand he has been dealt.",
      "But ultimately the biggest count against Brentford might be that there is no obvious firefighter appointment for when the panic sets in. They are not tempting the Sam Allardyces, Alan Pardews or Tony Pulises of this world off the after-dinner circuit, but absolutely could do the sort of absurd thing data-led clubs do when the wheels come off a little and make a damning call to someone like Jesse Marsch in February.",
      "",
      "5) Erling Haaland will break his own goal record\nThere is definitely a shout for Tijanji Reijnders to win the PFA Player of the Year award after proving that the tough First Guardiola Year is not actually a prerequisite for any new Manchester City signing.",
      "But a safer bet might be Haaland recovering from the shame of 38 and 34-goal seasons to start testing the structural integrity of Dixie Dean’s legacy again.",
      "A ludicrous level of attacking quality, depth and variety is contained within that Manchester City squad, spearheaded by a striker whose brilliance has been normalised. The goal record he set in his debut season is going to fall.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal will win a trophy\nIt is difficult to recall another manager or team at the start of any Premier League season whose success or failure was so specifically dependent on the procurement of trophies.",
      "Mikel Arteta promised to “give my life” to deliver silverware at the end of last season and a great many critics appear to have taken that literally, stating that this phase must be his last if he cannot drag Arsenal over the line.",
      "Oliver Glasner matching his trophy haul in a fraction of the time and on a fragment of the budget at Crystal Palace has not helped but Arsenal do feel set up to book that open-top bus tour soon.",
      "Say what you want about their entire attacking ethos centering around set-pieces, or everyone at the club being willing to sacrifice friends and family members for the mere chance at keeping a clean sheet. But this is surely a side designed to excel in knockout football once Viktor Gyokeres gets up to speed – if indeed the pub striker ever will.",
      "",
      "3) Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace will reign in Europe\nUEFA would be obliged to change the Super Cup regulations – presumably without sending any correspondence to Selhurst Park – so that the Europa League and Conference League winners would compete in a blood feud as the Champions League winners step aside.",
      "But after watching Premier League sides go deep or even win either competition in recent years, there is a sense that things might work out in the end for both teams.",
      "If Spurs can win the Europa League then Forest are absolutely capable out of sheer Morgan Gibbs-White-based spite, while Glasner has already delivered continental glory to Eintracht Frankfurt so can help continue the proud Premier League tradition of bullying teams they have a laughable financial advantage over.",
      "",
      "2) There will be an England bolter\nTake your pick from the expensive uncapped Englishmen capable of snatching the spotlight who have been signed this summer alone: Jamie Gittens, Jacob Ramsey, Omari Hutchinson, Jarell Quansah, Liam Delap, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, James Trafford.",
      "Then there is Elliot Anderson and Archie Gray, who could easily time their pushes perfectly to catch the eye of Thomas Tuchel.",
      "It wouldn’t be an international tournament season without an England bolter and the options this time around are plentiful.",
      "",
      "1) The Big Six is the top six\nIt is a common misconception and refrain that the branding of the Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs cabal is not reflective of the actual league table.",
      "The fact is it was never meant to be: those are simply the richest Premier League teams in a football sense. Their owners are not necessarily the most wealthy but the clubs themselves are more marketable than the rest in the country by an absurd margin and so can pay the highest transfer fees and wages with less pressure on sales.",
      "It is why talk of there being a Big Eight with Newcastle or Aston Villa included is nonsense, similar to suggestions that the Big Six are no longer a thing when one or even multiple members endure historically poor seasons. Manchester United and Spurs responded by just signing everyone else’s best players because they could.",
      "And they looked better for it. Manchester United leapt over a hilariously low bar against Arsenal, granted, and Spurs passed the test of playing a promoted Scott Parker side at home. But the improvements were clear and fuelled at least in part by weakening many of their rivals this summer.",
      "The so-called Big Six has been the top six in some order or other on precisely six occasions: 2010/11, 2014/15, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2021/22. This will be lucky number seven.",
      "When Alexander Isak is trending and you’re not based in Liverpool or Newcastle, just make up some nonsense…",
      "We’re trying to avoid Alexander Isak in this Mailbox so we start with Eberechi Eze and see where we go from there…",
      "Arsenal want Morgan Rogers after securing Eberechi Eze, do they? Tottenham could channel their frustration towards Manchester City…",
      "We have a PFA Team of the Year XI made up of players who have been included at least five times in the Premier League era.",
      "Eberechi Eze will remain loved by the vast majority of Crystal Palace fans; he did things very differently to Alexander Isak.",
      "Arsenal have beaten Tottenham to Eberechi Eze, but a move billed as a hijacking had actually been made long before Spurs struck a deal for the playmaker."

      "The 27-year-old criticised the way United was being run, accusing them of being in a transition without ever actually making a change.",
      "“You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time: they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.

This is what some people forget.",

People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.”",

      "“He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Neville’s defence of the club came after he named Amorim as his manager to watch this season. The former right back said “all eyes are on him” and predicted “massive pressure” if he does not perform.",
      "“This season I think the manager to watch is the United manager,” Neville said.",
      "“All eyes are on him. Can he do it? He had a horrible start to his United career. He didn’t want the job part way through last season.",

      "Old Trafford is a difficult place to go, especially on the opening weekend, but Arsenal found a way to win.",
      "They will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.",
      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",
      "But advantage Arsenal. The way I see it now is Liverpool and Man City have to go to Old Trafford to win to match Arsenal, and that's a huge positive at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Special mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.",
      "There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.",
      "If he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.",
      "No-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.",
      "It's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.",
      "The win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.",
      "I know it wasn't the hardest game in Wolves, but winning away from home 4-0 on the opening day of the Premier League is no mean feat.",

      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",
      "I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.",

      "You don't need to be Albert Einstein to work out how to play against PSG. You need as many defenders as you can on the pitch. Then, against Burnley, you need as many attackers on the pitch as you can to keep causing them problems.",

I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",
      "Neville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves",
      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",
      "Carragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "It's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.",
      "Neville - Adrien Truffert",
      "I was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.",
      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.",
      "Carragher - Oliver Glasner",
      "I think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.",

      "Ruben Amorim has praised his Manchester United side for not being \"boring\" during the 1-0 loss to Arsenal but Roy Keane has criticised the low expectations at the club following the defeat.",
      "United's new-look attack - consisting of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - impressed throughout the fixture as Amorim's side played with a fresh impetus going forward.",
      "The hosts unleashed a total of 22 shots towards the Arsenal goal, with nine of these coming from Mbeumo and Cunha, as well as two from fellow new arrival Benjamin Sesko off the bench.",
      "Despite their promise and threat, David Raya's seven saves at Old Trafford ensured Mikel Arteta's side walked away with a clean sheet and all three points on the afternoon after Altay Bayindir's error gifted Riccardo Calafiori the only goal in the game.",
      "​​​​​​​In the aftermath of the defeat, Amorim chose to focus on the positives from the performance, where he applauded their improved bravery and aggression in comparison to last season.",
      "\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home.",
      "\"We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.",
      "\"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",

      "United will look to convert another positive performance into points in their next fixture when they face Fulham, live on Super Sunday, on August 24.",
      "\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is OK with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better,\" Keane said on Super Sunday.",
      "\"It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.",
      "\"Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Man Utd.\"",
      "Speaking after the game, he said: \"I thought they [United] played well, they were the better team in terms of performance.",
      "\"We know that performance isn't enough sometimes. Arsenal have got real resilience and can grind out 1-0 victories.",
      "\"There were some positives. Mbeumo in the first half and Cunha in the second half. They showed they can handle a big game at Old Trafford, they showed they have got the quality and ability. We obviously know that from Wolves.",
      "\"This is a tough start. Arsenal are a tough team to break down. I'm not too downhearted. I thought the system worked better and the back three did better.",
      "\"Casemiro and Fernandes did well in midfield; they held their own. Throughout the match, Man United were the better team, but they have lost the game.\"",

      "Arsenal clinched a 1-0 win over Man Utd at Old Trafford thanks to Riccardo Calafiori's goal from a corner but the performance also highlighted the key areas for improvement this season; Viktor Gyokeres struggled to make an impact on his debut",
      "Sunday 17 August 2025 21:07, UK",
      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",

      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",

      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",

      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",
      "But crucially, they came away with a vital three points, showing their experience to win a game they were not at their best in. While Manchester United were beaten, there will surely be plenty of encouragement that this season will be more successful all around than the last.",
      "Man Utd: Bayindir (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Dorgu (7), Dalot (6), Casemiro (7), Mount (7), Fernandes (7), Cunha (8), Mbeumo (8).\n\n\nSubs: Amad (6), Ugarte (6), Sesko (6), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nArsenal: Raya (8), White (6), Saliba (7), Gabriel (7), Calafiori (7), Zubimendi (6), Rice (6), Odegaard (7), Saka (7), Martinelli (6), Gyokeres (6).\n\n\nSubs: Havertz (6), Madueke (6), Timber (6), Lewis-Skelly (6), Merino (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: David Raya.",
      "Gary Neville at Old Trafford: \"Arsenal really dug in. They showed a lot of resilience.",
      "\"We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some really good saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"Arsenal were never at their best but to come to Manchester, whether it is Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, it's always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.",
      "\"The Manchester United players look dejected. They are on the floor but if they keep up this level of performance, which is the big question, they will win a lot of points this season.",
      "\"I thought they did a fair few decent things out there but Arsenal were strong, and that set piece in the first half was the big difference in the game.\"",
      "\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home. We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.",
      "\"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",
      "\"Then the small things that we talk about in the beginning of this season when players like Cunha and Bryan can elevate the stadium in one moment. The most important thing - we weren't boring.",
      "\"We need to win games but that was a completely different game to last season.\"",
      "Roy Keane on Super Sunday: \"It's an important start for them [Arsenal] with the other teams doing so well over the weekend.",
      "\"It wasn't great in the second half, it lacked quality, especially from Arsenal's point of view, but you take the win on the first day of the season and move on.",
      "\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary said on commentary, everyone is okay with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better.",
      "\"It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.",
      "\"Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Manchester United.\"",
      "\"And we did it - one - because of the way we reacted to mistakes and - two - unfortunate mistakes and mistakes that are very far from the standards that we normally have, and we constantly reacted to that. And that's the reason why we had opportunity to win again.",
      "\"You're talking about character and spirit, that's it. I can make a mistake. How do I react to that? In open spaces, we should have killed them.",
      "\"The way everybody tried, the defence was phenomenal.\"",
