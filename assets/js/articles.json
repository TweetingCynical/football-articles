      "Manchester United are reportedly setting their sights on one of Brazil's most exciting defenders, Luis Eduardo. The 17-year-old wonderkid has caught the eye of several top clubs around Europe after the Under-17 World Cup last month.",
      "Eduardo was in action for Brazil in Qatar and was one of the players heavily scouted across the tournament. The South American nation finished fourth in the World Cup, losing on penalties in the semi-final to Portugal.",
      "Spanish outlet AS has claimed that Eduardo's performances have seen him emerge as one of the standout players. The Brazil captain's electric pace has put clubs, including United, on red alert.",
      "The report claims that Eduardo reached 38 km/h for Gremio U20 earlier this year. AS reports that both United and Chelsea have 'already done their homework and are trying to accelerate their pursuit'.",
      "Furthermore, it's reported that both teams have already begun negotiations with Gremio during the Under-17 World Cup, and offers are expected in the coming weeks. However, there could be a hefty price tag to pay.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "In the summer, the centre-back signed a new contract with the Brazilian side that runs until 2028. As part of the extension, a £53million release clause was inserted, a fee for which it is not yet known whether United would be willing to propose.",
      "United have emphasised signing wonderkids with an eye on developing them and using them in the first team. In previous years, the Reds have bought Chido Obi, Sekou Kone and Diego Leon in a bid to bolster their next generation of talent.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also earned plaudits for the trust he places in his younger players. 15-year-old JJ Gabriel has already been invited to train with the first team, with the wonderkid making the headlines over the weekend.",
      "The midfielder scored three goals in a 7-0 win over Liverpool for the Under-18s with silky footwork, dribbling and finishing wowing figures at the football club. Gabriel has been involved in first-team training in recent weeks, with speculation over his senior debut growing by the week.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to become United's youngest-ever Premier League player. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest players to make an appearance for United in the Premier League.",
      "He could even topple the Premier League record held by Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest. The teenager turns 16 next October.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer revealed he was left reeling after being informed he was sacked as Manchester United manager. The former Red Devils boss was appointed caretaker manager at Old Trafford in December 2018, following the sacking of Jose Mourinho.",
      "He was then given the permanent job in March 2019, following a period of successful results - a status he retained until he was fired in November 2021. Solskjaer, who spent 11 years of his playing career at United, oversaw a summer of huge spending in his final summer transfer window, with Cristiano Ronaldo making a triumphant return to Manchester.",
      "The £72million acquisation of Jadon Sancho had fans exciting while Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane was signed after a 10-year spell in Spain. In what was a superb start to the 2021/22 season, United won four of their first five Premier League games.",
      "However, the wheels began falling off for Solskjaer as United fell to five defeats in their next seven games, leaving them seventh in the table. It was a humiliating 4-1 defeat away to Watford that turned out to be the Norwegian's last game in charge, as his sacking was announced the following day.",
      "Speaking four years after his disappointing exit from Manchester, Solskjaer spoke to the BBC and revealed that while his exit was warranted, it no doubt quelled the sadness he felt when being informed of his termination.",
      "Speaking to Kelly Somers, the 52-year-old said of his time at Old Trafford: \"That pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way and that was [by] having great staff around us.",
      "\"[The] environment in and around the club was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work everyday, you need results. We unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Man United and they made a change which is fine.",
      "\"It was sad, we lost to Watford of course and I knew this was more or less the end. [I] drove my family to the airport, they went back to Norway actually and I was going to work. I got a text, 'Ole, I need to see you in my office', and I knew what was going to happen so I rang my wife straight away.",
      "\"'I'll be back, I'll catch you up', I said. I think it's sudden but not surprising. If you don't get results, you do make a change in football but I felt we had something going.\" Taking the United job is a daunting prospect at any time, especially for a manager who hadn't even coached a side in the English top-flight as was the case for Solskjaer.",
      "But even for the most seasoned of bosses, it was a job that proved too pressurised, according to the Norwegian. During the interview with the BBC, he claimed that then-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti said he wouldn't want the United job mid-way through a clash against the Toffees.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "With the likes of Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich on his CV, it was quite the statement from the Italian. Solskjaer explained: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.' And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure.",
      "\"That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.\"",

      "We're into December and that means we're on the month countdown until the January transfer window opens - with some huge mid-season deals being talked up.",
      "Mega sums were spent in the summer as the British-record transfer fee was twice broken, both times by Liverpool, but the Reds have no clicked and could yet be forced into the market. There's plenty of talk of Antoine Semenyo being on the move after impressing with Bournemouth.",
      "He has a £65million release clause as Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham all consider making the first move. The Reds still need to find a conclusion to the Ibrahima Konate saga as his contract continues to wind down.",
      "Marc Guehi, another summer target at Anfield, could still be on the move with his Crystal Palace contract expiring in the summer. Their manager Oliver Glasner has been critical of the club's lack of business, which could yet force them into making some moves.",
      "Arsenal sit top with their team looking particularly settled - and they are unlikely to make any moves. Manchester United's ideal time for business is the summer but - with a midfielder and a wing-back on their shortlist - the New Year could still bring new faces.",
      "Arsenal are reportedly weighing up a move for Borussia Dortmund star Karim Adeyemi. The 23-year-old has developed into one of the Bundesliga's most exciting forwards, registering 28 goal contributions in 56 appearances.",
      "Dortmund are thought to value Adeyemi at around £75m, though with his contract running until 2027, there may be room for negotiation.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly setting their sights on one of Brazil's most exciting defenders, Luis Eduardo.",
      "The 17-year-old wonderkid has caught the eye of several top clubs around Europe after the Under-17 World Cup last month.",
      "Gremio included a £53m release clause in the star's latest contract. It is not yet known whether United would be willing to propose such a fee.",
      "Goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos is on loan at Sevilla this season and has been asked about a permanent move to the La Liga side, per Sport Witness.",
      "“I have two more years on my contract with Newcastle. All I can say right now is that I’m very happy here,” he said.",
      "The Greek international is enjoying his time in Spain.",
      "\"I feel very good, very comfortable, both my family and me. That was very important for us,” he said.",
      "“The way I see everything here, the training ground, my teammates, the club, the fans, it’s exactly as I imagined it, and La Liga too. These were factors that made coming here an easy decision.”",
      "After Oliver Glasner's words yesterday, Crystal Palace are said to be looking to sign Manchester City striker Divin Mubama. The forward is on loan at Stoke City.",
      "The City youngster has five goals in 19 appearances this term.",
      "Fiorentina have no regrets over Michael Kayode's exit, despite his impressive form for Brentford.",
      "The 21-year-old has started every game for Keith Andrews since turning his loan permanent.",
      "Fiorentina’s academy director Valentino Angelino believes the move was the correct thing to do.",
      "Angelino said, via Sport Witness: “I don’t know about regrets. You have to analyse the moments, and at that moment he wanted to play and he wanted to do it everywhere. He had done extraordinary things.”",
      "Eddie Howe has revealed talks will take place soon over the Magpies' plans. \"No we haven't had discussions yet but we will soon,\" he said in his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"We never quite know what the month will look like. We need to be across it and prepared for all eventualities.\"",
      "\"I would always love to keep the squad fresh,\" he added. \"Every window, our outlook is to be active. Finances, I haven't had those discussions but we will in the next few days.\"",
      "Atletico Madrid are the latest club to be interested in a move for Marc Guehi.",
      "Liverpool saw their £35m deal collapse on transfer deadline day when Crystal Palace pulled the plug on the deal at the eleventh hour.",
      "Real Madrid, Manchester City and now Atletico have all been linked with a move for the England star. Guehi is out of contract in the summer and able to talk to clubs in Europe from January.",
      "According to MARCA, Diego Simeone are 'very attentive' of the situation and have reached out to Guehi’s representatives.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday boss Henrik Pedersen says Manchester United are pleased with Harry Amass' loan at Hillsborough. Amass is expected to continue his loan until the end of the season.",
      "\"I know they are very happy, and, of course, they have to be very happy,\" Pedersen told The Sheffield Star. \"He is in a team that has a lot of trust in him and who work very, very seriously with him as a part of the team, but also individually.",
      "\"He also has a group of fantastic mirrors in our team [in the form] of the senior players, where he can learn a lot. He is in a good group where he has a big respect around him, and we have big respect for Man United giving us the possibility [to sign him] and I am sure they have big respect for how we have worked with him.",
      "\"I hope we can continue [to work with him] after January. Of course, he fits well in our way of playing, he is developing well and I cannot see any reason not do it.\"",
      "Antoine Semenyo would fit in at any top club, according to Shaun Wright-Phillips, but he should think twice if Chelsea comes calling.",
      "Semenyo is available for £65m in January, with Liverpool and Man City among those most closely linked.",
      "Wright-Phillips told BestBettingSites: \"A move to any of the big clubs would make sense. He’s good enough for Chelsea, but Chelsea have too many wingers really, so they wouldn’t need him.",
      "\"If I was Garnacho or Gittens and Semenyo arrived, my head would drop, because he’s just one of those players who would start every game if I was manager.",
      "\"His end product is just so high, it’s so good. I think he would suit Liverpool. The way Iraola plays, though, reminds me of how Pep sets up his City side, but just a little bit more aggressive and on the front foot. So you never know, he might end up at City.",
      "\"I think he's a fantastic player. It’s nice to see a player who is just in such excellent form that he has so many options at the top of the table.\"",
      "Oliver Glasner wants to see an active January transfer window from Crystal Palace after a quiet summer. Speaking on the club's plans, he said: \"I think, in January, just correct what we missed in summer, to be honest.",
      "\"We will have played 34 games, I think, until January 10 and it's about 60-65 per cent of the season. Let's see.\"",
      "\"I think that [lack of depth] is the issue, and I never talked about it, but today it feels like it's time, because I want to protect the players,\" he added.",
      "United ace Kobbie Mainoo has been linked with a January exit, should Ruben Amorim decide to allow it. Napoli have been strongly suggested to be interested.",
      "Reports in Italy, claim Juventus are interested in the midfielder. The Serie A side are open to a loan.",
      "Manchestter City have made an initial enquiry to Everton over Iliman Ndiaye, per footmercato.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have expressed their interest in the attacker as they consider a new winger. The Toffees star has scored four goals this season and has a contract until 2029. Everton are said to have no interest in a sale next month.",
      "Antonee Robinson is the subject of interest from Everton, per reports. The US full-back has been linked to a return with Ryan Sessegnon currently Marco Silva's preferred option at Craven Cottage.",
      "Robinson came through Everton's academy. A £25m offer could await, according to Alan Nixon.",
      "Real Madrid central this morning",
      "Manchester United are said to be 'serious' about making a move for Los Blancos ace Federico Valverde. The Red Devils plan to strengthen their midfield and he is the latest name under consideration, per reports in Spain.",
      "Feels a tough one to do.",
      "Liverpool plan to table a £52.5m bid for Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, per reports. The Frenchman is not said to be untouchable with Xabi Alonso also having the likes of Aurelien Tchouameni and Federico Valverde at his disposal.",
      "It may take a larger fee to prise him away you'd think given the fees Liverpool paid in the summer...",
      "The January transfer window opens in a month but, despite the need to bolster certain positions, ESPN reports that Man Utd are looking to bypass the mid-season window and instead do their business next summer.",
      "That said they remain open minded and will act if it is in their best interests. Injuries to key personnel may alter their stance but finding quality players for good value can often be a challenge midway through the season, when clubs tend to hike their prices.",
      "Man City are considering triggering Antoine Semenyo’s £65m release clause in January after his impressive showings for Bournemouth.",
      "The Times reports that Pep Guardiola's are among a number of clubs monitoring Semenyo’s situation. Liverpool have also been linked with the 25-year-old.",
      "City haven't committed to making a move for Semenyo, but some feels as though a January move could give them the boost they need to close in on Premier League leaders Arsenal in the second half of the campaign.",
      "We're back after several months away.",
      "The summer was certainly an eventful window and there's a few deals bubbling away ahead of January.",
      "Watch this space.."

      "Recently, United's good run of form has been disrupted by draws against Tottenham and Nottingham Forest. A 1-0 loss to 10-man Everton was a harsh blow for the Red Devils, but Amorim urged his players to reset and go again.",
      "A comeback against Palace at Selhurst Park has seen United leapfrog into the top half of the table. Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount cancelled out Jean-Philippe Mateta's opener from the penalty spot as three points made their way back to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim dropped Patrick Dorgu for the 2-1 win over Crystal Palace, citing \"anxiety\" around the young defender. Recently, the Danish full-back appeared to ridicule Amorim's choice to play Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in a midfield pivot after he 'liked' a post criticising the decision on social media.",
      "While Dorgu being dropped to the bench may have been a disciplinary issue, Amorim set the record straight by confirming why he made the change. The Portuguese boss insisted that he is trying to find a solution to help the defender perform to his true ability.",
      "Amorim said: \"What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games. When I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was different to the decision that he’s making in our team.",
      "\"So I just need to understand the context in trying to help them. I think they are far from the best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I think they have so much more to give. Let’s see this week if we improve that.\"",
      "Highlighting the tension felt on the pitch, he added: \"He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touched the ball — I can feel it, the anxiety.",
      "\"And I remember the shot [missed] against Everton. That was easier than the decision that he had to make when the guys from Scotland were there, when he made a great decision.",
      "\"And I saw it when he played in Italy. But, again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford has fulfilled his dream of playing at the Camp Nou as Barcelona ran out 3-1 winners over Alaves on Saturday. The United loanee made his first appearance at the club's revamped stadium at the weekend, coming on as a half-time substitute in the win.",
      "Rashford has had the image of playing at the iconic stadium in his mind since joining in the summer, stating that it will be an enjoyable experience. At the time, the English forward said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The 28-year-old has impressed so far for the Catalan club, scoring six goals and assisting nine times in all competitions. This includes a stunning double against Newcastle in the Champions League, as well as strikes against Olympiacos, Sevilla and Elche.",

      "In the midst of a drubbing, there was one moment that symbolised a problem that threatens to undermine everything David Moyes is trying to do. Thierno Barry thought he had finally opened his account for the club when his sliced mis-kick spun past Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Alas, VAR got involved and spotted that Barry had inadvertently set up the chance with his arm. And so, that means Barry, who cost £27million from Villarreal, has played 464 minutes of Premier League football without scoring, without assisting, without registering a single shot on target.",
      "Rightly, the 23-year-old French striker was praised for his physical endeavour in the wins over Manchester United and Fulham and those left inside the stadium gave him a decent ovation when he was substituted late in the hammering by Newcastle United.",
      "His effort, enthusiasm and commitment cannot be questioned. But Moyes is going to need a striker who carries more threat if Everton's season is going to develop into a positive one.",
      "Barry’s struggles are highlighted when Moyes’ defensive operation has an off-day - and it was a major off-day against Newcastle.",
      "“From the get-go, we were very flat,”: said Jake O’Brien. “For periods we were good, but we just left ourselves open at times and gave them too many opportunities, and they took them. We were chasing the game and we left ourselves wide open.",
      "“It is important that we put it behind us and go into Tuesday (Everton are away at Bournemouth) with a positive mindset and come away with three points.”",
      "Moyes refused to use the absence of key midfielder Idrissa Gueye, who was sent off for slapping team-mate Michael Keane in a rare win at Manchester United on Monday, as an excuse for a performance full of holes.",
      "“It could be that, but it could have been the quality of Newcastle United. You mustn’t underestimate them, they’re a Champions League team,” he said. “They got off to a great start, we got off to a terrible start. They were much better than us, played better, and much more experienced than we are.",
      "“You can see Newcastle are learning from the Champions League games. When they had to defend, they are hard to play against and really quick on the counter-attack.",

      "Patrick Dorgu has expressed his gratitude to the Manchester United faithful following the Red Devils' triumphant return to form against Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon. Ruben Amorim's men fought back from a goal down to secure a crucial 2-1 win at Selhurst Park.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta had given Palace the lead in the opening period, but United struck back after the interval to completely flip the script. Joshua Zirkzee drew the visitors level on 54 minutes with a clever finish before Mason Mount netted the decisive goal just after the hour mark.",
      "The victory propels United up to seventh in the Premier League standings, having amassed 21 points from their first 13 fixtures. They now trail third-placed Chelsea by just three points.",
      "Following United's success in south London, Dorgu turned to Instagram to address the travelling supporters. Posting alongside a snap of himself in action, the left-back wrote: \"Always thankful for the support [red love heart emoji].\"",
      "Having featured from the start in Monday's disappointing 1-0 home reverse to Everton, Dorgu found himself relegated to the substitutes' bench for the game against Palace. Nevertheless, he still managed to see some action, coming on for Amad Diallo during stoppage-time.",
      "Amorim opted to deploy Diogo Dalot at left wing-back with Amad operating on the opposite flank. Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw comprised the defensive trio with Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Zirkzee leading the attack.",
      "Amorim's tactical switch followed remarks he made during a press briefing about Dorgu and the disparity in his performances for Denmark compared to United. \"When I see them training they are doing so much better than in games,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he's scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was completely different to the decision('s) he's making in our team.",

      "Looking back on his team's triumph, Amorim appeared relieved. When questioned whether he delivered any tactical instructions at the interval to spark a response from his United squad, the Portuguese manager revealed: \"No, we just wanted everyone to understand the game.",
      "\"I felt in the last 10 minutes of the first half that the opponent was struggling, and that they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling, and we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",
      "\"We tried to change little things in the game - the intensity and the quality in the way we connect, especially Josh [Zirkzee] - he improved a lot the way we played.",
      "\"It was massive,\" Fernandes, meanwhile told MUTV, when asked how big the win was for United. \"We needed the three points after the performance and the result we had last week.",
      "\"We needed a response very quickly. I think first half was not great for us, but the second half was a very big response.\"",

      "Barcelona's sporting director Deco has claimed Marcus Rashford had to shoulder too much responsibility \"too young\" - which ultimately led to his struggles at Manchester United.",
      "The forward, now on loan with the Spanish giants, burst onto the scene as a teenager a decade ago but has been unable to regularly deliver at Old Trafford with his long-term future very much in doubt. He made his debut under Louis van Gaal in 2016 - scoring a brace in Europe.",
      "Rashford's stock rose at a rapid rate but he's already played under five permanent managers in Manchester and, from a young age, was seen as one of the team's leading lights. He was often among the first to be called out when the team fell short, which has been all too regular.",
      "Ruben Amorim appeared to take issue with Rashford's attitude and he's on his second loan spell away from Manchester with Deco claiming he has been forced to take on too much at times whilst the constant upheaval has proven an issue.",
      "He told The Times: “He’s happy with us. Marcus is a fantastic player. He faced the responsibility of becoming an important player at Man United - United, like us, are one of the biggest clubs in the world - too young.",
      "\"He suffered a bit with this change of generation at United too. If you see United in the last five years, they had difficulties rebuilding the team, to become stronger again. He was there. So it’s not easy for a player [from whom] people demand a lot. When you are an important player, you have a lot of responsibility.",
      "“We were looking for a player like him on the market. A player that could play in the three positions up front. We were able to sign Marcus on loan now because of his desire to play for Barcelona. He waited a lot. He knew that we were dealing with financial rules. But he was patient. He waited and we’re happy to have him.”",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rashford's move to Barcelona will become a permanent one, although there is an option in his loan agreement. Despite an abundance of quality in Catalunya Rashford has still proved a worthwhile addition, scoring an impressive brace on his return to England against Newcastle earlier this season.",
      "The United loanee has scored six times during his loan stint and looks to have rediscovered his form away from Manchester. With his boyhood club he has endured huge highs, including a season where he hit the 30-goal mark, but equally been hammered when things have not gone to plan.",

      "Sir David Beckham has heaped praise on Ruben Amorim and believes Manchester United are on the up following Sunday's crucial 2-1 win at Crystal Palace.",
      "United snapped a three-game winless streak by battling back to overcome Palace at Selhurst Park. Second-half strikes from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount overturned Jean-Philippe Mateta's early opener.",
      "The result lifted the Red Devils back into the Premier League's top half and up to seventh spot, sitting three points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa and four shy of Manchester City in second.",
      "\"He has tweaked a few things and we are coming into a few better results. There's still a long way to go and there has been a few games where we haven't been playing as well.",
      "\"But I think we've got a good manager there and I think he is changing things slowly.\"",
      "Last month, Beckham was approached to back a takeover bid for United, according to The Sun. A consortium from the United Arab Emirates asked ex-Reds midfielder Beckham to be an ambassador for the bid, with the Middle East firm said to be preparing to make an offer to buy the Glazers' majority shareholding in the club.",
      "Beckham has frequently criticised the Glazers, with the 50-year-old urging the Americans to sell in 2023 while acknowledging he would be receptive to future involvement with the club. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos took control of the club's football operations in late 2023, following their acquisition of a 27.7 per cent stake.",

      "Ruben Amorim joked he is using Manchester United’s weeks without European football to “steal” set-piece ideas after snatching a rare win at Selhurst Park. And the Reds were able to commit daylight robbery against an exhausted Crystal Palace side who lost in the Conference League on Thursday night.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee - with his first Premier League goal for a year - and Mason Mount took Manchester United ’s tally to 10 deadball goals from 13 games this season. Both came from assists from free kicks from captain Bruno Fernandes. And after a terrible first half, the Portuguese coach said he had learned the importance of set-piece goals after a year in English football.",
      "“We work a lot,” said Amorim. “We have more time to work, we work a lot and we learn a lot in England. I think you are used to seeing that but when you come for the Premier League you learn a lot with other teams how to do it and we are stealing a lot of things to score goals.”",
      "Selhurst Park has been a bogey ground for the Old Trafford club with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial the goalscorers for their last win in South London during the pandemic in July 2020. And that terrible run looked set to continue when Jean-Philippe Mateta netted a retaken penalty after 32 minutes.",
      "United target Adam Wharton found the France striker with a gorgeous reverse pass before Leny Yoro brought the Palace striker down with a clumsy challenge. Mateta scored the spot kick at the second attempt after VAR ordered a re-take after an accidental double touch but Palace had other chances to seal a home win.",
      "Palace had chances to seal the win in the first half as Amorim’s side looked as lethargic as last season - and in the Monday defeat to Everton. But he inspired his players to finally raise their game after the break as the FA Cup holders flagged after kicking off only 62 hours after their loss in Strasbourg.",
      "“I just said to the players we need to be more alive,” said Amorim. “They were getting tired for the second half and we talked about that. And again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.”",
      "That goal came after 54 minutes. Fernandes chipped forward a free kick into space and Zirkzee controlled the ball on his chest before lashing a left-footed shot past former Manchester United keeper Dean Henderson. It was Zirkzee’s first Premier League goal since December 1 last year - and his first in any competition since April.",
      "The injury-hit Dutchman said: “A great feeling. It’s always a good feeling to score but most importantly it got us back into the game.”",
      "Speaking about Zirkzee’s display, Amorim said he had personified United’s improvement.",
      "“It was really important,” said the Reds manager. “But it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half he struggled on the duels and he won some duels in the second half. We improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. That is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We play better because Josh played better in the second half.”",
      "Fernandes played a shorter ball from a free kick after 63 minutes for Mount to drill home the winner through a shambolic Palace wall.",
      "It was the Eagle’s first Premier League home defeat since February 15 as Oliver Glasner, who also plays 3-4-3, failed his audition to be potentially Manchester United new boss next season.",
      "Instead Amorim saw his side win in London for the first time this season as he took a big step to qualifying for Europe and staying at Old Trafford next season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Despite falling behind to a first-half penalty netted by Jean-Philippe Mateta, second-half goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount clinched a vital three points for Ruben Amorim's men.",
      "The win was a much-needed boost following a disappointing streak of three matches without success for United. Recent draws at Tottenham and Nottingham Forest were followed by a disheartening 1-0 defeat to a 10-man Everton side on Monday night.",
      "During the loss to the Toffees, pundit Neville didn't mince his words when criticising Shaw. \"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" the ex-United defender remarked during co-commentary.",
      "\"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling, you can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time, I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for, but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's a waste of time. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw put on a solid performance against Palace this weekend, playing a pivotal role in United's victory and ensuring the scoreline wasn't more severe at half-time with his crucial blocks against opposition forwards.",
      "During his 82-minute stint on the pitch, Shaw made three interceptions, three clearances, blocked one shot and managed three recoveries. He also won half of the ground and aerial duels he contested.",
      "With less than ten minutes remaining, Shaw was substituted for Lisandro Martinez, who made a much-anticipated return from an ACL injury that had kept him off the pitch since February.",

      "The Dutchman has endured a difficult 18 month spell at Old Trafford, not coming up with the goals that were hoped for. He's fallen down the pecking order following United's summer spending spree but was on hand to help them pick up all three points at Crystal Palace.",
      "It was Zirkzee's first goal of the season and came after Deeney had taken aim at the forward, who only scored seven times last term. The ex-Premier League forward claimed he could do a better job that the Dutchman if he was given a few weeks to train with the Manchester outfit.",
      "Deeney had said on talkSPORT: \"It’s really poor again from Zirkzee. I’ve been retired for two years – Man United give me six weeks and a third of what he’s doing and I’m probably sure I can do better. It is embarrassing watching him play at this moment in time. He just looks like a lost soul, an absolute lost soul.\"",
      "Zirkzee was on hand to respond to his doubters as he scored on 54 minutes to bring United level at Selhurst Park. He latched onto a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, controlled the ball before lashing a shot across Dean Henderson and into the far corner.",
      "Deeney claimed Zirkzee's strike left him stunned, not just because of his struggles this season, but also because it showed the confidence of a striker who was on top form, not someone who had struggled for involvement.",
      "He said: \"He’s got no right to score that. I’m questioning the ‘keeper, but it’s a wonderful finish. We’ve been giving him grief, and rightly so, but that’s a massive moment in his career. I’m flabbergasted that he’s done that. It’s not even the fact that he scored the goal, it’s the fact he’s shown you nothing in this game so far that you would even get a shot off. But to even have that level of self-assuredness to even take the shot. The confidence of it is frightening.\"",
      "Zirkzee's strike cancelled out Jean-Philippe Mateta's penalty before Mason Mount grabbed United a winner in south London. It was the ideal response for the Red Devils, who were beaten at home by Everton on Monday. The three points lifting Ruben Amorim's side up to seventh.",
      "The United boss was full of praise for how Zirkzee improved following a difficult first-half. He said: “It’s so important for the strikers to score goals. He’s not playing many minutes but the way he responds in the second-half is so important.",
      "\"It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A well-placed free-kick found the Dutchman in the box and he managed to equalise with a stunning strike from the tightest of angles. Mason Mount then stepped up to put United in the lead for the first time in the game, scoring just under ten minutes later",

      "Manchester United star Joshua Zirkzee has expressed his gratitude to his teammates for their support during his goal drought. The Dutch forward finally found the back of the net after an agonising eight-month wait, scoring a crucial equaliser in United's Premier League win over Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon.",
      "His last goal for the club came in April against Lyon in the Europa League - with his most recent Premier League goal dating back nearly a year. Zirkzee's strike sparked a comeback for United, who rallied from behind to snatch three points at Selhurst Park.",
      "The victory propelled Ruben Amorim's squad above their rivals in the Premier League standings, putting them in sixth place. And his forward was naturally delighted.",
      "\"It was all about the three points today. I'm just very happy that we got them, very important.\"",
      "When asked about the strain of not scoring while playing for United, he admitted: \"It's one of the biggest clubs in the world and you have to perform. So, if you don't score for a long time, then it can get to you.",
      "\"But I'm surrounded by great players, great people and we help each other every day and they made it quite easy for me. It was all about the three points today, just very happy that we got them, very important.\"",
      "He added: \"Today is just a reward, I think, for patience, for hard work and trying to be consistent and I'm just thankful to the manager as well, staff, everyone. A good environment.",
      "Midfielder Mason Mount, who netted what proved to be the decisive goal from a free-kick, praised his side's resilience in overturning the deficit.",
      "\"We've not found it easy away from home this season, obviously a very difficult result last game (a 1-0 loss vs Everton), so we know we needed to bounce back and that's what we spoke about before the game,\" he said.",
      "\"I think we showed good character to come back from 1-0 down in the first half. It was about reacting in the changing room in the second half.",
      "\"I thought we came out and we were really good. We were at it.\"",
      "Mount continued: \"I'm feeling good, the win was massive today but, also, for me to play the full game, I haven't done that in a while.",
      "\"I've been feeling really good recently - with no problems, I'm enjoying my football and when you have days like this in front of the fans like this it makes it worth it.\"",

      "If Joshua Zirkzee does indeed leave Manchester United in January, then he will do so having finally broken his Premier League duck. It had been almost a full 12 months since the Dutchman had scored in the Premier League before he struck at Selhurst Park on Sunday.",
      "Zirkzee, a £34million signing from Bologna in the latter months of Erik ten Hag's tenure, has seen chances be few and far between this season, the club's £200million summer splurge on attacking talent - plus the return to fitness of Mason Mount - pushing him down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim. He could have gone in the summer had there been a buyer that met United's demands before Napoli's deal for Rasmus Hojlund came to fruition.",
      "With Benjamin Sesko the new first choice in attack and Matheus Cunha also ahead of him as Amorim's second pick for his side's No.9, Zirkzee is keen to leave when the transfer window reopens for more regular action. He needs it if he's to be in Holland's World Cup squad and there's interest in Italy, notably from Roma, to take him back.",
      "In truth, he was only starting in south London because both Sesko and Cunha were absent and Amorim prefers Bryan Mbeumo - the third member of the summer's attacking reload - to play from the right rather than operating as a focal point. It's a return to prominence that nobody saw coming either a few weeks ago - when Cunha was thriving and Sesko was starting to find his feet - or at the end of summer, when Amorim was still happy to let him leave if the right deal could be done.",
      "But with injuries giving him an opportunity, Zirkzee made his point with a fine second half display, his 54th minute strike getting United back on terms after Jean-Philippe Mateta's opener, before Mason Mount's winner.",
      "It came after a difficult first half, where Zirkzee and indeed United as a whole had been off the pace. There were some harsh words shared in the away dressing room at the break, and Zirzkee gave Amorim the response he desired.",
      "\"Scoring is important but it's not just the goals,\" said Amorim on Zirkzee's display. \"They give confidence but Joshua has also improved a lot in how he holds the ball. That should give him a lot of confidence.",
      "\"He influences the game and that's important to our game. He needs to maintain that level in training.\"",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes was delighted with Zirkzee's contribution and insists he's capable of putting his 11-month scoreless streak behind him and giving the Red Devils real cutting edge this December.",
      "“Obviously, it’s important for every player to score. Strikers want goals and want their chances, but it’s not just about that,\" said the Portuguese. “Josh contributes so many different things to the team even when he doesn’t score.",
      "“We’re very happy, of course, because we know this will give him a boost of confidence to try more and create more shooting opportunities - he’s very capable of it.”",
      "United and Amorim may well need him to be among the goals in the coming weeks. But by the time January arrives, he may well be on the outside looking in once more.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Lineker was at Selhurst Park watching Crystal Palace take on Manchester United as the former Match of the Day presenter celebrated his 65th birthday. The former England striker watched on as United staged a fightback against Palace to claim all three points, with goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount securing the victory.",
      "His son George also posted a birthday tribute on Instagram, saying: \"Happy birthday to the old man. Keep smashing it.\" Gary reshared the message on his own Instagram stories.",
      "Lineker has been without a regular presenting role since his widely-publicised departure from Match of the Day in May. At the point of leaving, he had become the programme's longest-serving host, fronting the BBC's premier football programme from 1999 through to 2025.",
      "Last month, Lineker announced he would be making a television comeback to present ITV's upcoming programme The Box. Filming is scheduled for later this year, with the show set to broadcast in 2026.",
      "Discussing the new venture, Lineker said: \"I can't wait to host The Box. I've always felt right at home in the box on a football pitch and whilst this is a different proposition, the fundamentals are similar. The contestants will have to quickly and masterfully work out how each game works, whilst also trying to get ahead of the competition to take control.",
      "\"It's going to be unpredictable and thrilling to watch, and I'm excited that I get to have a front row seat to all the action!\".",
      "United's victory in south London ensured that they bounced back from Monday night's dismal defeat at home to Everton - a result which had ended an encouraging five-match unbeaten run.",
      "Asked about his side being the top six post-game, Amorim said: \"In this moment I just want to evaluate our team. We need to evolve and create variety in how we build-up - that's the most important thing.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim praised Joshua Zirkzee for a much-improved second-half vs Crystal Palace, with the Dutchman the spark for the Red Devils' comeback win. Amorim's side came from behind to secure victory at Selhurst Park on Sunday.",
      "Jean-Phillipe Mateta had given Palace the lead from the penalty spot. But Zirkzee equalised shortly after the break with a well-taken strike for his first goal in 25 Premier League appearances.",
      "Mason Mount then flipped the game on its head to secure victory. But Amorim was full of praise for Zirkzee, after seeing an improved performance from the former Bayern Munich man after the break.",
      "\"The small things. The way that Josh [Zirkzee] controlled the ball in the second half was different. The way we defend second balls was different. So these small details make the difference and then the talent so we score two.\"",
      "On Zirkzee's performance in particular, the Portuguese coach, who had words with the Dutchman at half-time, added: “It’s so important for the strikers to score goals. He’s not playing many minutes but the way he responds in the second-half is so important.",
      "\"It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "Both of United's goals at Selhurst Park came from set pieces - Zirkzee and Mount getting on the end of creative free-kicks from Bruno Fernandes. It now means that United have scored from 10 set piece situations this season, the same amount as table-topping Arsenal.",
      "On that record, Amorim said: “It’s so important in our league because it's hard to play against every opponent. You can sense throw-ins, free-kicks, corners, to score a goal and open the game to give confidence to the team. In the Premier League, if you don’t work on set pieces, you are losing the game already.”",
      "United will be aiming to make it back-to-back wins next week. They take on West Ham at Old Trafford in midweek before a clash with struggling Wolves at Molineux.",

      "It may have been freezing conditions near the away dressing room at Selhurst Park at full time, but the jovial mood among the Manchester United squad was keeping spirits warm. Captain Bruno Fernandes joked with Joshua Zirkzee to pull his trousers up while a beaming Luke Shaw spoke at length with veteran commentator Martin Tyler before heading to the team bus.",
      "Ruben Amorim was keen to continue the positive atmosphere as he took one look at the assembled cast of journalists waiting in the mixed zone and teased doing a preliminary press conference before the main event. In the end, he made his apologies and ran up the stairs to the Media Centre.",
      "Match winner Mason Mount's positivity was obvious as he strolled up to the journalists, joking that we were blocking him from exiting. When the laughter subsided, Mount took us into the conversation between himself and Fernandes shortly before the winner.",
      "He explained: \"We always have a little conversation. I said to him: 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said: 'You stay there,' and then I said: 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it...He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption and then hit the target.\"",
      "Sunday was the first time Mount has completed 90 minutes in the league since he was at Chelsea, coincidentally against the same opposition as this weekend. \"It felt like a long time,\" Mount laughed when asked about playing the full game.",
      "\"It is obviously a massive positive for me as well. I have been working hard recently, I feel really good now so to get that 90 minutes under my belt is really positive, it is all about recovery now and going towards the next game.\"",
      "At half-time it felt as though such a light-hearted conversation with Mount was not going to take place. United were poor in the opening 45 minutes and were deservedly behind at the break thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's re-taken penalty.",
      "While United fans may have been panicking, this was not the case for Amorim in the dressing room. Mount said: \"He was saying to keep going, stay calm do what we needed to do. We all knew what to do in that second half.",
      "\"They have just played recently so we felt they could drop off in that second half, there was chances there for us so just carry on what we are doing. Obviously difficult to go down 1-0 but we showed character to get back into the game in the second half.\"",
      "While not the perfect performance, the result is all that matters at this stage for the Reds. They are now back within touching distance of the top four and Mount was clear his desire is now to push on.",
      "He said: \"I have had niggles but nothing bad at all [this season]. I have felt good this season, I had a good pre-season under my belt, I have been working hard in training every week, not just me, but as a group we have been at it, it's up and down but we are in a lot better place me personally and a group.",
      "\"We need to kick on now, win more games and the most important thing is to win, difficult result in the last game but to come back today was massively important. So yeah it is time to kick on now and shoot for those top four positions.\"",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways on Sunday with a 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace. The Reds were slow in the first half and an opener from the home side always looked to be on the cards.",
      "When Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta, the striker gave Palace the lead. United were revitalised after the break and two set pieces made the difference. Fernandes set up Joshua Zirkzee for the equaliser and then laid the ball off for Mason Mount to win it.",
      "After a much-needed three points for United, MEN Sport has taken a look at the moments you may have missed from the game:",
      "Martinez leads the way",
      "Coming onto the pitch before the game, the substitutes arrived around ten minutes after the starting XI. As they emerged, most of the players trudged towards the centre circle. But one man who was definitely ready for action was Lisandro Martinez. He led the way onto the pitch and looked back at his fellow subs as if to demand they picked up the pace. It shows the mentality and standards he is setting.",
      "United need leaders in the dressing room and having Martinez back fit is a huge boost.",
      "Casemiro and Henderson reunion",
      "Just before the first big chance of the game, Casemiro took the chance to reunite with Dean Henderson. He clasped hands with the former United goalkeeper. Moments later, the Brazilian gave him a gift as he somehow did not convert from close range.",
      "Special kind of pain",
      "It was a special kind of torture for United as they conceded the opener. The first goal looked fine at first glance, and \"Boom, boom, boom, boom, Mateta's in the room\" was chanted by the home fans.",
      "United fans could be heard chanting ‘What the f****** hell was that?’ but unfortunately for them, VAR ensured another rendition would follow as Mateta converted his second attempt.",
      "Yoro head in hands",
      "After United equalised there were wild scenes in the away end, but Yoro couldn't hide his frustration at his own performance. He had his hands on his head while sitting on the bench after being replaced by Noussair Mazraoui. It has been a difficult week for Yoro but he is still young and he will learn from a tough few days.",
      "Fernandes comes good",
      "After the Everton defeat, Bruno Fernandes will not have been happy with his own performance. However, the theory that when the captain plays well, United play well was clear after this victory.",
      "Fernandes was not in the first half but he led from the front in the second. His two free kicks aside, the Portuguese midfielder impressed with his work rate and set the standard for his teammates - a good afternoon after a rocky start for him.",

      "United equalised in the second half through Joshua Zirkzee before Mason Mount scored the winner.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Selhurst Park:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty. 3",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Shaw made a great block to deny Palace a two-goal advantage just before half-time. Not much attacking threat came down his side all afternoon, which was a compliment from the hosts. Booked for a professional foul. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Was relocated to right-wing back, where he has looked comfortable, but he wasn't involved with the intricate play he is capable of orchestrating down that side. Could have done better. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Amorim could not believe that Casemiro did not fire United into the lead just a minute into the match. The Brazilian wasted a header from a free-kick, but improved after a shaky start. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes is world-class because he creates something even when he is having an off day. Fernandes was responsible for both of United's assists from set-piece routines. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled by default but made a difference with his long throw-ins, although it would have been difficult to have been a downgrade on Patrick Dorgu after his display against Everton. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo was untouchable before the international break, but he hasn't returned with as much zest. He still worked hard down the right, but he is capable of more in the final third. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made his first start since playing a key role in the win against Liverpool at Anfield. His performance was similar - hard working and industrious, but there was a key difference: he scored. 8",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Offered nothing in the first half, following up a good touch with a bad one, but equalised with a brilliant finish. Zirkzee's half-volley had to be powerful to beat the goalkeeper - and it was. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "He was an improvement on Yoro. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Fine on his appearance since February. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Same as Dorgu. N/A",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has \"so much more to accomplish\" in his career after making his 150th appearance in the Premier League against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ruben Amorim questioned his options at left wing-back ahead of the trip to Selhurst Park, admitting Dalot and Patrick Dorgu weren't performing on matchdays as well as they were during training.",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team to face Palace and delivered an improved performance. The Portugal international was the United player with the most duels won and was responsible for winning the foul that led to the second goal, a display which earned praise from Amorim.",
      "When asked whether Dalot's display was the benchmark for a player in that role, Amorim said: \"It's of course defending and attacking. If you have certain characteristics, the pace, you can go right or left because you also can play with your left.",
      "\"You need to use that in every single game in the Premier League and not just one game and then we drop a little bit the level. But it's the same thing that I said with Patrick. I know they have a lot of quality. They just need to be relaxed sometimes and show that and show the intensity and the pace that they have.\"",
      "The game saw Dalot make his 150th appearance in the Premier League, which he said is a source of \"pride for playing at the highest level for so many years”.",
      "Dalot added: “I’m very happy to reach this beautiful milestone in the biggest league in the world. My journey has been one of constant growth as both a man and a player, and I’m proud of what I’ve achieved knowing that I’m only 26 and still have so much more to accomplish in my career. I’m enjoying every moment.”",
      "Dalot started in wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, but he struggled against Nottingham Forest, and Dorgu was recalled to face Spurs before the international break.",
      "The 26-year-old is more comfortable on the right, but has played predominantly at left wing-back this season.",
      "When asked after Liverpool if the victory was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways in a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday. It was a much-needed win for Ruben Amorim after their disappointment against Everton on Monday, igniting pressure back on the Portuguese.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount were on target as they came from behind to beat Oliver Glasner's side, with the Austrian previously mooted to succeed Amorim. It's a relentless week for United as they take on West Ham in midweek before travelling to strugglers Wolves on Sunday.",
      "The transfer window is now one month away from opening, allowing United to further strengthen their squad before embarking on the business end of the season where European qualification will be a priority.",
      "However, United face several key decisions in January if they are to offload players and open up a budget to reinvest into the squad. Marcus Rashford faces an uncertain future after spending the last season-and-a-half away from the club on loan, he is currently enjoying his spell with Barcelona.",
      "Reports suggest Hansi Flick's side are leading the race for his signature with Paris Saint-Germain also interested.",
      "Elsewhere, Adam Wharton has been suggested to be a candidate to join the midfield options in Manchester. United got a closer look at the in-demand England international on Sunday, with reports suggesting that he could leave Selhurst Park for £70million.",
      "Meanwhile, Xabi Alonso's start to life as Real Madrid has been far from smooth sailing with reports of friction amongst the squad. It has been claimed that Fede Valverde is on United's radar, but they're yet to meet the valuation.",
      "Barcelona chief Deco has spoken highly of Marcus Rashford after his loan spell in Catalonia.",
      "In an interview with The Times, he said:",
      "“He’s happy with us.",
      "\"Marcus is a fantastic player. He faced the responsibility of becoming an important player at Man United — United, like us, are one of the biggest clubs in the world — too young.",
      "\"He suffered a bit with this change of generation at United too. If you see United in the last five years, they had difficulties rebuilding the team, to become stronger again.",
      "\"He was there. So it’s not easy for a player [from whom] people demand a lot. When you are an important player, you have a lot of responsibility.",
      "\"We were looking for a player like him on the market. A player that could play in the three positions up front. We were able to sign Marcus on loan now because of his desire to play for Barcelona.",
      "\"He waited a lot. He knew that we were dealing with financial rules. But he was patient. He waited and we’re happy to have him.\"",
      "According to Fichajes, Manchester United are exploring the possibility of appointing Xavi as a replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "It has been said that United are assessing their long-term managerial candidates and the former Barcelona boss is viewed as someone who aligns with their long-term vision.",
      "Xavi is club-less after leaving Barcelona but it has been said that Spurs are weighing up an approach with pressure mounting on Thomas Frank.",
      "Seems pretty far-fetched considering United won yesterday.",
      "In yesterday's Sunday Mirror, AS Roma reportedly want to rescue Joshua Zirkzee from Manchester United.",
      "It was claimed that a move will depend on whether the Serie A side can agree a fee with United next summer after a six-month loan with a view to a permanent deal in Rome.",
      "United are said to want to recoup £36million for the Dutch forward.",
      "Although, it was published before Zirkzee equalised for United on Sunday and opened his account for the campaign.",

      "However, the England international will snub an Old Trafford move if they fail to qualify for Europe, it has been claimed.",
      "United are said to be confident of landing the midfielder for £70million.",
      "In doing so, they would beat a host of their rivals to his signature as they plot their latest department rebuild.",
      "In the same article, it was claimed that Man United will block an exit for Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The United academy graduate managed just four minutes after being brought on late against Crystal Palace.",
      "Mainoo expressed his desire to leave the club in the summer but a move didn't materialise and now, he has been forced to endure a frustrating period on the bench - making sporadic appearances.",
      "With the window opening next month, Mainoo will face increasing scrutiny over his future.",
      "Mick Brown has previously claimed that an exit will be blocked.",
      "He said: “They know they made a mistake letting McTominay leave.",
      "“I was aghast at the fact they were even contemplating letting him go given the issues they had in midfield, and he’s done an incredible job since leaving.",
      "“He’s gone away, knuckled down and become an absolute superstar for Napoli and for Scotland.",
      "“But I think Man United have learned from the mistake of letting him go, and they’re going to take a different approach towards Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“There’s been a lot of talk about his future, will he stay, will he go, will the manager give him more minutes or is he going to stay on the fringes?",
      "“As far as the club are concerned, there are no plans to let him go, because they know if he left it would be the same situation we’ve seen with McTominay.",
      "“He would go and impress wherever he went, and all of a sudden everybody would be asking why he wasn’t allowed to do that at Man United.",
      "“So if those offers do come in for him, I’d be very surprised if they allowed him to leave, and I still think he’s a huge part of their plans for the future.”",
      "Football Insider have claimed that Barcelona are favourites to sign Marcus Rashford.",
      "The England international has returned to the world stage at both club and country level after ending his difficult spell at Old Trafford.",
      "The outlet have claimed that Barca are working to make his time at the Nou Camp permanent. Rashford's chances of penning fresh terms with the club have reportedly been boosted after sources told the outlet that Robert Lewandowski's contract would not be extended.",
      "According to Caught Offside, Manchester United want to sign Fede Valverde.",
      "The Uruguayan is reportedly disgruntled at Real Madrid after failing to strike an immediate relationship with Xabi Alonso.",

Amorim reflected on his first year in the job ahead of the win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "\"I think it's not hard to understand what the fans want, first of all, but of course it was a surprise.

      "Eduardo represented Brazil in Qatar and was heavily scouted throughout the tournament. Despite Brazil finishing fourth after losing to Portugal in a penalty shootout during the semi-finals, Eduardo's performances stood out.",
      "Spanish publication AS has reported that the Brazilian captain's impressive speed has put clubs, including Manchester United, on high alert. The report suggests that Eduardo reached speeds of 38 km/h playing for Gremio U20 earlier this year.",
      "It is said that both United and Chelsea have 'already done their homework and are trying to accelerate their pursuit'.",
      "Moreover, it's reported that both clubs have already started negotiations with Gremio during the Under-17 World Cup, with offers expected in the coming weeks.",
      "However, securing Eduardo's services may come at a significant cost, reports the Mirror.",
      "Over the summer, the centre-back signed a new contract with Gremio that runs until 2028. As part of this deal, a £53million release clause was included, and it remains unclear whether United would be willing to meet this fee.",
      "United have been focusing on signing young talents with the aim of nurturing them for first-team action. In recent years, they've brought in Chido Obi, Sekou Kone and Diego Leon to strengthen their future squad.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also been praised for his faith in his younger players. 15-year-old JJ Gabriel has already been invited to train with the first team, making headlines over the weekend.",
      "The young midfielder netted three goals in a 7-0 victory over Liverpool for the Under-18s, impressing club figures with his smooth footwork, dribbling and finishing skills. Gabriel has been participating in first-team training recently, fuelling speculation about his senior debut.",
      "Gabriel could potentially become United's youngest-ever Premier League player. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are currently the youngest players to have made an appearance for United in the Premier League.",

      "However, they went into the break behind as Leny Yoro clumsily brought Jean-Philippe Mateta down in the area. After VAR chalked off his first penalty, the striker stepped up and wrong footed Senne Lammens again for the opener.",
      "After the interval, United were the better side as Palace tired. Their first came as Bruno Fernandes picked out Joshua Zirkzee in the box and he fired it beyond Dean Henderson from a tight angle.",
      "The Reds' winner came from another free kick as Fernandes produced a little lay off for Mason Mount to fire in. United have now leapfrogged Palace in the table and Glasner was unhappy by the manner of the goals conceded.",

The defender has been on a long road to recovery since picking up an anterior cruciate ligament injury at the beginning of February, and he was congratulated by his teammates at full-time.",
      "Ruben Amorim has previously said that United were missing Martinez \"a lot\" due to his \"aggression\" and presence in the dressing room, adding: \"We need Licha in this team.\"",
      "Fernandes spoke to MUTV after securing a 2-1 win against Palace and he was asked about Martinez's return, saying: “It’s very important to have him back, it’s such a long spell that he was out, even for himself, it’s great to be back with the team to have this feeling of playing games again.",
      "“We know how much he struggled being out without being able to play for us. He’s back and one more option to have such big quality in the team, so we’re very happy with it.”",

      "The good work of October was in danger of being undone by an awful November, but United clawed their way back into the game, winning the battle of endurance against a tired Crystal Palace. The season is a marathon and it was crucial United stopped the rot, and they did in Croydon after a concerning first half.",
      "United had won just one of their last 11 Premier League away games - against Liverpool at Anfield last month. Speaking during the pre-match press conference, Amorim admitted he didn't know why his team struggles on the road, but he said that his players need to learn how to \"finish games\".",
      "Amorim axed Patrick Dorgu from his starting line-up following his admission that he senses \"anxiety\" from the defender when he's on the ball. Diogo Dalot came into the team, but the Portugal international has also been unconvincing at left wing-back this season.",
      "Shea Lacey, 18, was the only attacking option on the bench. Kobbie Mainoo has played as a No.10 in Amorim's system, but the United boss has confirmed he views him as a deep midfielder. Only Arsenal (six) had conceded fewer goals than Palace (nine) in the Premier League this season, and United had been hopeless in the final third against Everton earlier in the week.",
      "But United still had no excuse not to pose a threat on Sunday. Palace were in European action against Strasbourg in France on Thursday, meaning they had just two days to prepare, compared to United's five days of preparation at Carrington, so the Reds rocked up to Selhurst Park with an immediate advantage.",

Amad assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and it felt like their relationship could be key again. As it turned out, United managed to claim a win despite the pair not being at their best.",
      "Dalot contributed more in the first 30 seconds than Dorgu had in 58 minutes against Everton, launching a long throw-in into the box, which Casemiro remarkably did not find the net from.",
      "The away section belted out '12 Days of Cantona' for two obvious reasons: December is now just around the corner and United were playing at the scene of the infamous kung fu kick.",
      "Amorim looked frustrated as Palace began to carve out opportunities. He paced up and down the touchline and was reminded by the fourth official to stay within his area. Then Mbeumo was shown a yellow card for throwing the ball to the ground, clearly frustrated at how the game was unfolding.",
      "Adam Wharton sent a shot straight at Senne Lammens from the edge of the box, Jean-Philippe Mateta missed a sitter after a mistake from Yoro, and Yeremy Pino was stunned to see his effort blocked by Yoro in a later move. Yoro managed to redeem himself for his blunder leading to Mateta's chance.",
      "Mateta continued to ask questions. He bullied Matthijs de Ligt and drew another mistake from Yoro, who needlessly fouled him in the box from a position that was never going to yield a clean challenge.",
      "The penalty was converted - but there was a double touch and VAR ordered it to be retaken. That rule needs to change because the opponent should not be given another bite at the cherry after botching the first penalty. Nonetheless, Mateta scored his second penalty.",
      "\"Boom, boom, boom, boom, Mateta's in the room\" was chanted twice to the tune of the Vengaboys hit. The double embarrassment should have sparked a response, but the white shirts limped into the interval. Amad and Mbeumo were not at the races, and United do not tend to fire when the pair underperform.",
      "Luke Shaw shook his head as the whistle went for half-time. Shaw has been at United for 11 years and was making just his 300th appearance for the club. The defender has played for five permanent managers during his time at Old Trafford and might have been close to playing for another if the Reds had not completed a comeback. There will not be another inquest come on Monday morning.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both had the desired effect. Dalot had a great game and Mason Mount finished brilliantly to fire United into a 2-1 lead. It was a brave decision from Amorim to stick with Joshua Zirkzee, but even that call was vindicated by the Dutchman's well-taken half-volley to equalise.",
      "Zirkzee's shot had to be powerful to beat Dean Henderson - and it was. Zirkzee has not looked like a striker since his arrival from Bologna, but he will be alright if he can score more goals like that for United.",
      "The Everton performance was shocking and Amorim needed to produce an answer. He did.",

      "Ruben Amorim joked Manchester United have improved their set-piece record by \"stealing\" ideas from rivals in the Premier League, following a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring from the spot in the 32nd minute. United were awful in the first half and the hosts thoroughly deserved their one-goal advantage at the interval.",
      "United looked like a different team when play resumed. Joshua Zirkzee equalised, firing his half-volley beyond Dean Henderson, and Mason Mount made it 2-1 from another set-piece routine.",
      "The Reds are now level with Arsenal with the joint-most set-piece goals in the top flight this season, having scored 10 goals from set-play scenarios just 13 games into the campaign.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United had put more work into set-pieces during training, and he said: \"No, we work a lot. We have more time to work, we work a lot and we learn a lot in England.",
      "\"I think you are used to seeing that, but when you come for the Premier League you learn a lot with other teams how to do it and we are stealing a lot of things to score goals. \"",
      "Amorim discussed what he said to the players at half-time, saying: \"It's just to understand for everyone to understand the game. I felt in the last ten minutes of the first half, I felt that the opponent was struggling and they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling that we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",
      "\"And it was that, of course. We tried to change little things in the game. But the intensity and the quality in the way we connect, especially Josh in our connection, was better and that improves a lot the way we play.\"",
      "When asked whether he believed United could turn the game around, he said: \"I felt that because I had the feeling that if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box and you can feel it the way they move.",
      "\"They were getting tired for the second half and we talked about that. And again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League. So we increased that and I had the feeling that if we score one goal this is going to change completely.",
      "\"I really like also the way we controlled the game with the ball, winning the game. So we were in front but we were not afraid of trying to score the next one and to control the ball in their half.\"",
      "Amorim believes the lack of intensity in the first half was due to 'small details'. \"Sometimes it's a lot of things,\" he added. \"Sometimes you don't need to move but the pace of the ball can be better.",
      "\"You need to understand that Mateta was the man that had the time to think and if you see in the second half, sometimes it was him that starts the play. All these small details I think we improved. And when you have one play, two plays, the rhythm flows better and you increase everything mentally and physically.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has opened up about the shock he felt upon learning of his dismissal as Manchester United manager.",
      "The ex-United boss took over the reins at Old Trafford in December 2018, stepping in after Jose Mourinho's departure. He was then awarded the permanent role in March 2019, following a string of successful results - a position he held until his sacking in November 2021.",
      "Solskjaer, who had an 11-year stint as a player at United, presided over a summer of significant expenditure in his last transfer window, which saw Cristiano Ronaldo make a sensational return to Manchester.",
      "The £72million signing of Jadon Sancho stirred excitement among fans, while Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane was brought in after a decade in Spain. United kicked off the 2021/22 season on a high note, securing victories in four of their first five Premier League matches.",
      "However, things started to unravel for Solskjaer as United suffered five losses in their subsequent seven games, leaving them languishing in seventh place. A crushing 4-1 defeat to Watford proved to be the final straw for the Norwegian, with his dismissal announced the next day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reflecting on his unceremonious exit from Manchester four years later, Solskjaer told the BBC that while his departure was justified, it did little to ease the disappointment he experienced when he was informed of his termination.",
      "Speaking to Kelly Somers, the 52-year-old reflected on his tenure at Old Trafford: \"That pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way and that was [by] having great staff around us.",
      "\"[The] environment in and around the club was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work everyday, you need results. We unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Man United and they made a change, which is fine.",
      "\"It was sad, we lost to Watford of course and I knew this was more or less the end. [I] drove my family to the airport, they went back to Norway actually and I was going to work. I got a text, 'Ole, I need to see you in my office', and I knew what was going to happen so I rang my wife straight away.",
      "\"'I'll be back, I'll catch you up', I said. I think it's sudden but not surprising. If you don't get results, you do make a change in football but I felt we had something going.\"",
      "Accepting the United position represents an intimidating challenge at any point, particularly for someone like Solskjaer who had never managed in England's top division before taking the role.",
      "However, even for the most experienced managers, the position proved overwhelmingly demanding, the Norwegian admitted. During the BBC interview, he revealed that then-Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti confided during a match between the sides that he wouldn't fancy the United job.",
      "Boasting a CV that includes Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, the Italian's statement was quite significant. Solskjaer recalled: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.' And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure.",
      "\"That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.\"",

      "Mason Greenwood has attracted interest from Napoli once again, and a double Manchester United reunion could be possible if the Italian giants revive their pursuit of the player. The former United academy graduate left the club in the summer of 2023 after United concluded a six-and-a-half month investigation and decided 'it would be most appropriate for him' to recommence his career at another club.",
      "Greenwood had been charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour and assault. He always denied all allegations. The Greater Manchester Police announced on February 2 that charges against Greenwood had been dropped.",
      "The 24-year-old joined Marseille the following summer and has made 54 appearances to date for the French club. His stint in France has caught the eye of several clubs, with Calcio Mercato reporting that Napoli are among those interested.",
      "However, Marseille's valuation is said to be over €60million (£53m). Antonio Conte's side tried to sign Greenwood prior to him joining Marseille.",
      "At the time, The Athletic reported that Napoli had made contact over a move but were unsuccessful.",
      "Whether they return to negotiations remains to be seen, but if a move were to happen in the near future, Greenwood would be reunited with Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The latter is currently on a season-long loan at Napoli, with an obligation-to-buy clause included in the deal. If Napoli qualify for the Champions League then he will join in a £38m permanent transfer.",
      "Both players have excelled in Italy, with McTominay establishing himself as a midfield mainstay. Last season, he was named Player of the 2024/25 season.",
      "As for Greenwood, he is an important player for Roberto de Zerbi at the Orange Velodrome and any potential January transfer would prove difficult.",
      "\"He has the qualities to become one of the best players in the world,\" said the Italian coach. \"He's incredibly talented, but he still needs to be even more useful for the team.",
      "\"I want to protect him because I don't like seeing him criticised – he's scored a lot of goals, he's never missed training, and he still has room to grow.\"",
      "Greenwood completed a move from United to Marseille in a deal worth up to €31.6million (£28m).",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be looking for a reaction on Sunday when his team travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League. The fixture is a difficult one after such a disappointing result against Everton on Monday evening.",
      "However, United have an advantage given Oliver Glasner's side played on Thursday night at Strasbourg in the Conference League with a host of first-team players featuring in the 2-1 defeat. While the Reds also enter the game on the back of a defeat, they will have had six days to prepare.",
      "United will be without Benjamin Sesko. His knee injury suffered in the draw at Tottenham Hotspur is a few weeks away from healing. The Slovenian could be back by the time Bryan Mbeumo and Amad leave for AFCON.",
      "As for the other team news, Amorim confirmed Matheus Cunha will be expected back for the fixture against West Ham but the trip to Palace is a game too soon for him. Harry Maguire also remains absent. So with this in mind, take a look at how our United writers think the Reds should line-up vs Palace.",
      "The absence of Maguire and Cunha is a blow, but Palace were in action in France on Thursday night and there is no excuse for the United players not to produce a response to the Everton defeat.",
      "Amorim said he senses \"anxiety\" from Dorgu when he picks up the ball. The options at left wing-back are not ideal, but I would recall Dalot to the side at Selhurst Park.",
      "The injury news opens the door for Mainoo to make his first Premier League start of the season with Fernandes in the false nine role. Zirkzee is not good enough to lead the attack for United in the league.",
      "United experimented with Zirkzee as the centre-forward against Everton. They should not replicate that at Palace - it did not work.",
      "Mbeumo has experience playing as a centre-forward so starting him as the false nine could work well for the Reds. Amad can play at right wing-back and pushing Bruno Fernandes into the No.10 role alongside Mason Mount is the best option. THat would open the door for Mainoo to make his first Premier League start of the season partnering Casemiro in the middle.",

      "Ruben Amorim has dropped Patrick Dorgu from Manchester United's starting line-up against Crystal Palace. It comes after the defender appeared to mock him on social media.",
      "Earlier this month, Dorgu's Instagram account 'liked' a post criticising Amorim's team selection, leading to speculation about tension between the two.",
      "The post includes a screenshot of a comment from X reading: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "There is no definitive proof that Amorim's choice was influenced by Dorgu's online activity. Still, the Denmark international had started United's previous two fixtures - a 1-0 defeat by Everton on Monday and a 2-2 draw with Tottenham.",
      "Diogo Dalot has taken his place at left-wing back, with Amad Diallo deployed on the right in front of a back-three consisting of Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro. Dorgu, meanwhile, must settle for a spot on the bench.",
      "\"They trained really well, the others too. Then the tactical aspect. Mason Mount is really smart, gives us more possession. He is intense, he can score goals so is one more player to be near the box.\"",
      "This follows Amorim acknowledging that Dorgu, who squandered a golden opportunity to equalise against Everton, is experiencing a confidence crisis. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" the Portuguese manager explained.",
      "\"When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he's making in our team. I think it's the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "\"I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve.\"",
      "Dorgu was Amorim's first significant signing at United, joining from Lecce for £25million midway through last season. He quickly became a regular starter, with Amorim confident in using him as the side's sole out-and-out wing-back.",
      "Nevertheless, spells of inconsistent performances have tempered some of the initial enthusiasm surrounding his arrival. After starting five of United's opening league matches this season, he was relegated to the bench for the next four.",
      "Although he returned to the starting XI against Tottenham earlier this month, a lacklustre showing against Everton appears to have pushed him further down the pecking order once more.",
      "United will be desperate for three points after failing to win their last three league games. Monday's loss to Everton ended a five-match unbeaten streak, United's longest under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils go into the match sitting 12th in the table. A win could see them rise as high as fifth, but defeating Crystal Palace will be a tough challenge.",
      "United have not won at Selhurst Park since 2020 and are without victory in their last four clashes with the Eagles. Their most recent meeting finished in a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford in February, with Jean-Philippe Mateta scoring twice in the second half.",

      "JJ Gabriel's burgeoning reputation rose even further as the Manchester United wonder kid hit a stunning hat-trick in a 7-0 Under-18 demolition of Liverpool. Gabriel, still only 15, netted two individual efforts in the first half before adding a third after the break as United ran riot.",
      "Bendito Mantato opened the scoring early on with a driven finish before Gabriel then took centre stage. His first was a superb effort where he twisted and turned inside the box to bamboozle the home defence before firing home. And his second was in a similar vein with a powerful finish into the roof of the net to make it three.",
      "Louie Bradbury, returning from injury, netted the fourth while Jim Thwaites converted a penalty to make it five. Liverpool were shellshocked and Samuel Lusale added a sixth before Gabriel crowned his fine afternoon with his third and United's seventh.",
      "Gabriel has been involved in first team training under Ruben Amorim in recent weeks and one of the most highly rated talents to come through the academy. The teenager and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "Gabriel has spoken to Amorim, with the United boss discussing his philosophy and stressing the importance of working hard. Omar Berrada (CEO) and Jason Wilcox (director of football) were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and fans have speculated when he could make his senior debut.",
      "The 15-year-old has the potential to become United's youngest-ever Premier League player. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest players to make an appearance for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record held by Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘seriously considering’ a Tottenham Hotspur target replace head coach Ruben Amorim for three reasons.",
      "Amorim has been under intense scrutiny this season, and he appeared on the brink of an exit at the start of this campaign.",
      "The pressure on the Red Devils boss has slightly eased of late as the English giants have had a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League.",
      "This was until Man Utd slumped to an embarrassing 1-0 loss to 10-man Everton at the start of last week, with this result and performance sparking criticism for Amorim and his tactical approach.",
      "Therefore, Amorim desperately needed his side to respond when they faced Crystal Palace and battled back from behind to win 2-1 at Selhurst Park.",
      "READ: Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance?",
      "Despite this, club legend David Beckham has backed Amorim as he thinks he is starting to “turn things around”.",
      "“He has tweaked a few things and we are coming into a few better results. There’s still a long way to go and there has been a few games where we haven’t been playing as well.",
      "“But I think we’ve got a good manager there and I think he is changing things slowly.”",
      "Still, Man Utd appear to be keeping their options open as a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they ‘want’ former FC Barcelona boss Xavi, who is also attracting interest from Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Xavi has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 2023/24 season, but it has been widely reported that he is looking for a return to management.",
      "Man Utd are also said to be admirers of Xavi for three main reasons.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Although there has been no direct contact yet, both Manchester United and Tottenham have decided that, if their results do not improve soon, they will talk to Xavi Hernández about a possible agreement.",
      "‘His profile is appealing because he offers a long-term project, an offensive approach, and a ball-based strategy, qualities that fit very well with what both clubs are looking for.’",
      "Daniel Farke is clear Sack Race favourite as Leeds slump into the bottom three, but Thomas Frank and Arne Slot are hot on his heels amid Spurs and Liverpool crises.",

      "After winning three Premier League matches in a row in October, the Red Devils have reverted back to their inconsistent form again in recent weeks.",
      "Their 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday was their first win in four matches and pushed them up to seventh in a congested top half of the table, four points off second-placed Man City.",
      "And Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim wants to improve his squad in the winter transfer window with rumours a midfielder is at the top of his wishlist.",
      "But they are also looking to improve their attack, according to some reports, with Spanish publication Fichajes insisting that Man Utd have already ‘submitted’ an ‘offer’ of £60m to sign Barnes from Newcastle.",
      "Barnes, who is in a brilliant run of form, is also the subject of interest from Chelsea with Man Utd seeing him as the ‘ideal signing to revitalise their attack’.",
      "READ: Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance?",
      "It is understood that Newcastle ‘have no intention of letting him go’ but Man Utd are ‘prepared to increase their offer’ in order to get a deal over the line.",
      "The report adds: ‘In England, there’s already talk that the battle between Manchester United and Chelsea could be one of the fiercest of the winter transfer window. Both clubs are looking for immediate talent and see Harvey Barnes as a solution for both the present and the future.",
      "‘Market experts believe that if either of the two ultimately secures the signing , this move would set the trend for January, as Harvey Barnes is one of the most highly valued wingers in the Premier League.’",
      "Barnes has four goals and an assist in his last five matches in all competitions and the one-cap England international earned praise from Newcastle legend Alan Shearer after scoring a brace in a 2-1 win over Man City in November.",
      "Shearer said: “I thought he gave the full-back a really difficult game.",
      "“Obviously, he missed an absolute sitter, but the part I like about that is… a lot of players would then go and hide. He actually put the most difficult one away, and it was a brilliant finish.",
      "“I was impressed with his performance, not only his goals, but his work rate and the way he went past the full-back, the way he tried to get balls in, and he was a constant out for Newcastle as well as his hard work, so I thought it was a terrific performance from him.”",
      "Newcastle boss Eddie Howe was also full of praise for Barnes, he said: “Two great goals for Harvey, he missed a couple in the first half, but he is always a player that gets chances, and that is the great thing about him. When you put him on the team sheet, you know there is going to be some moments.",
      "“His first goal was an outstanding finish and that was probably the hardest of the ones he had today, found the corner with his right foot. The second one is about being in the right place at the right time. Two massive goals for us and hopefully that can lift us in the Premier League.”"

      "Premier League • England",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear to the Manchester United board that he does not want to offload Joshua Zirkzee in January and believes the Dutchman has now earned the right to prove his worth to the club – while the Portuguese’s thoughts on letting Kobbie Mainoo move on can also be revealed.",
      "The Dutch forward has not had an easy time of things since moving to Old Trafford in a £36.5m (€42.5m, $49.5m) deal from Bolonga in summer 2024. While he scored on his debut, a 1-0 win over Fulham at the start of the 2024/25 campaign, Zirkzee has netted only eight times in his 56 appearances for United, while just three assists show he’s not really good enough to play as a No.10 either.",
      "However, the 24-year-old spent the recent international break preparing for his big opportunity in the team as Manchester United reacted to Benjamin Sesko’s injury.",
      "Amorim has always admired Zirkzee on a technical level, but has been unsure how to fit him into the team’s plan.",
      "However, after spending a lot of time coaching the player and working on his game in a programme designed to not just work out his role for the club but how they could unlock his full potential within the current set-up, United and Amorim are now starting to see their efforts bear fruit.",
      "And while Zirkzee has been linked with a move away – and Roma are confirmed admirers of the player and are very much open to a January deal if an arrangement could be agreed – this spell was always viewed as a pivotal period in determining his future.",
      "If it had gone badly, then United were willing to open up to a departure. However, he scored a good goal in the 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday, and sources are now suggesting that Amorim is now very much keen to keep him for the rest of the season.",
      "IN-DEPTH 🔴⚫ Five strikers Man Utd could target in the January transfer window as Zirkzee Plan B",
      "An exit has never been pushed by the boss because he is concerned about the lack of depth and likes the fact that Zirkzee understands his game plans.",
      "And with Zirkzee on the scoresheet and helping United overturn a 1-0 half-time deficit to win 2-1 at Selhurst Park, Amorim was quick to praise the Netherlands international.",
      "“It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball, so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "The game also saw Kobbie Mainoo enter the action as a 90th-minute substitute, meaning he has still only played 170 minutes of action in the Premier League this season – and all eight of his appearances have come off the bench, with none as a starter.",
      "Also strongly linked with a January departure, the midfielder still faces a fight to get a move to another team in January, with Amorim only willing to sanction his exit if a replacement is signed first.",
      "Zirkzee, meanwhile, had played just 82 minutes combined across this Premier League season leading into the last international break, but has played the full 90 minutes of their last two games.",
      "As a result, Amorim is aware that it only takes one injury for the situation to change; hence the manager’s unwillingness to let the 20-year-old midfielder leave without a fight.",
      "Get the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
      "On the subject of potential new midfielders, United have been given a golden opportunity to sign Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher, as speculation ramps up over a potential January switch to Old Trafford.",
      "As reported by TEAMtalk transfer insider Fraser Fletcher, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson top the shortlist.",
      "But the trio will all command fees north of £70m, perhaps even as high as £100m, so their potential signings will likely have to wait until next summer.",
      "Wharton, meanwhile, showcased exactly why United should move for him with an outstanding first-half display in Palace’s 2-1 defeat to the Red Devils, and with sources able to shed light on the likelihood of a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "In other news, a shock report claims United have presented a ‘contract offer’ to Antoine Semenyo, after holding a meeting with his representatives on Wednesday last week.",
      "Liverpool are still considered frontrunners to sign the Bournemouth winger, but Amorim is a big admirer of his."

The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",

      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top five after 13 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",

      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",

      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after runs of four straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs go to Newcastle – where their recent record is utterly horrific – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ does anything more than delay the inevitable ahead of Chelsea, before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘seriously considering’ a Tottenham Hotspur target replace head coach Ruben Amorim for three reasons.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firmed up again. Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, conceding only one in the last four games from a PSxG of 3.5.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (78%).",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario has conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive. Back to being solid at Palace.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that have taken the Spaniard into the black.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have lost one in seven. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Tables are fun, aren’t they? And we’ve got loads of them, based on all the metrics you could possibly need. Create your own too, between any dates or on a specific date. Enjoy yourself here.",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",
      "",
      "The Bournemouth keeper is a massive faller in the last three games after conceding nine from a PSxG of 5.2 against Villa, West Ham and Sunderland.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",
      "Arne Slot produced a tactical masterclass to get Liverpool a much-needed win: dropping Mo Salah, picking a right-back and above all, playing against West Ham.",
      "Is the Arsenal ‘bottling it’ narrative starting to gain some early momentum? Apparently Mikel Arteta made a ‘shocking decision’.",
      "Jurrien Timber has forced his way back into a Premier League XI that now has a Chelsea player too.",
      "Arne Slot, Ruben Amorim, Thomas Frank…they will all be thrown from the top-floor window of the Premier League’s gaudy, gold skyscraper of excess.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "As soon as Ousmane Dembele was awarded the 2025 Ballon d’Or, the speculation began about the 2026 iteration."

      "A game which allowed for a like-for-like comparison between managers and players in the same system saw Ruben Amorim and Manchester United overwhelmingly pale in that comparison to their Crystal Palace counterparts in the first half, before they took full advantage of their hosts’ malaise after the break to claim victory.",
      "As Jean-Philippe Mateta bulldozed his way through the United defence the ball was frequently seen bouncing off Joshua Zirkzee on at the other end, as Maxence Lacroix treated the maligned Red Devil’s attacking presence with the disdain it deserved with a dominating display completely at odds with that of Matthijs de Ligt, who shrunk in the presence of the Palace striker.",
      "Luke Shaw continued to ‘amble’ and so too did Marc Guehi, but the latter in a peak Virgil van dijk ‘I’m better than you’ sort of way rather than the former’s tribute to the current ‘his legs have gone’ iteration of the Liverpool captain.",
      "The most damning contrast came in midfield, where Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes routinely played passes to where teammates could and perhaps should have been but weren’t, often into spaces actually occupied by Crystal Palace players, as Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada showed them how that midfield pivot can function effectively.",
      "Wharton is inarguably the star man in the pairing. His excellent round-the-corner pass for Mateta before Leny Yoro tumbled into the striker to concede the penalty was one of many examples in the first half of his forward-first desire and ability.",
      "As both Casemiro and Fernandes dawdled on the ball, Wharton – and to a lesser but still notable extent Kamada – didn’t hand their opposite numbers the opportunity to catch them in possession as they did to them. It works because, unlike the United duo, they can both do everything, albeit with varying levels of quality.",
      "Mateta could easily have scored a couple more and Palace really should have been at least two up at the break as Eddie Nketiah ran in sand to deny himself a clear opportunity to score in stoppage-time. A United comeback looked incredibly unlikely.",
      "They were better in the second half and showed plenty of the “fight” Amorim was desperate for after the defeat to Everton. Crucially, they were playing for the manager.",
      "But it did feel as though their superiority was more down to Palace’s dwindling reserves of energy than their own uptick in intensity.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s side hadn’t won any of their previous three Premier League clashes after Thursday night Conference League commitments, losing to Everton and Arsenal, and drawing with Brighton. And they looked as though they had quite simply run out of gas after their 2-1 away defeat to Strasbourg.",
      "Eight of the starting XI for the midweek game started here and while Wharton only played an hour in France, his downturn in the second half was as notable as anyone’s, and he was hooked with 15 minutes to go here as Palace searched for an equaliser after Casemiro and Fernandes wrestled control in the second half.",

      "Zirkzee wouldn’t have emerged for the second half had Amorim had any options on the bench to replace him. He probably wouldn’t have been playing if that had been the case. But it was a glorious finish from Fernandes’ free-kick as he controlled on his chest and smashed the ball across Dean Henderson from a tight angle.",
      "He’s not the answer for United, as he made abundantly clear through much of what he did in this game. But he made the difference in a moment, as Mason Mount did with a drilled shot after a short Fernandes pass from another free-kick to draw United level with Arsenal at the top of the charts with ten goals from set pieces this term.",
      "And in what Arsenal have shown to be a tried-and-tested method of picking up Premier League wins for much of this season, United followed up their set-piece goals with some solid defending.",
      "Has Amorim therefore in fact got United on the same path imperiously trodden by Mikel Arteta’s side on their way to Premier League dominance? They played similarly safe, often boring football before a recent surge in quality and impact from open play.",
      "The lack of any distinguishable attacking pattern whatsoever suggests that if that is the case there’s a helluva way to go a year on from Amorim’s appointment.",
      "But at the very least, in what should be a given but hasn’t been and certainly wasn’t in the first half here, United won this game by – as Amorim said afterwards – “fighting for every ball”, albeit against an opponent with little fight left in them.",

      "Manchester United are widely expected to target new wing-backs in the transfer market as Ruben Amorim has struggled to find a workable solution for either flank this season, and after giving a brutal assessment of Patrick Dorgu on the back of the Dane’s ill-advised use of social media this week, the Red Devils manager’s team selection for the clash with Crystal Palace suggests the 21-year-old could soon be out in the cold.",
      "Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing as Manchester United boss when he joined in a £25m move from Lecce in January. He struggled along with the rest of his teammates in his debut half-season and there are no real signs of improvement in the left wing-back this term, with recent performances leading him to be picked out as a weak link in the United side.",
      "In a withering assessment of his contributions ahead of the Palace game, Amorim said: “You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he’s making in our team. I think it’s the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "“I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve. I just need to understand the context in trying to help them (Dorgu and Dalot). They are far from their best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I just look at them, and think they have so much more to give. So let’s see this week if we can improve that.”",
      "Dalot, who’s also been far from his (mediocre) best takes Dorgu’s place on the left, with Amad Diallo dropping deeper in place of Noussair Mazraoui at right wing-back and Mason Mount coming into the starting lineup to occupy one of the inverted No.10 spots.",
      "Dorgu’s snub comes on the back of him failing to realise the media attention paid to social media posts slating the Manchester United manager, and more specifically the players’ responses to said posts.",

      "An Instagram post pointing out the flaws in Amorim’s management of the club which stated ‘Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together’ received a ‘like’ from Dorgu, or at least Dorgu’s profile this week.",
      "And while Amorim is yet to respond to his wing-back’s misguided social media actions, and frankly if he’s asked about it in a press conference or interview quite a large part of us will die inside, the pre-game comments he did make on Dorgu suggest United will look to bring in someone to play ahead of him as a priority.",
      "Asked why Mount and Dalot came into the starting lineup on Sunday, Amorim said: “It’s the way you train. They trained really well, the others too. Then the tactical aspect. Mason Mount is really smart, gives us more possession. He is intense, he can score goals so is one more player to be near the box.”",
      "Manchester United XI: Lammens, Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Dalot, Mbeumo, Mount, Zirkzee.",

      "“I think he has his right to say that and ask that, but at the same time you can say that he has to show more as well. Every player needs to work on their game and improve, and Kobbie is no exception.",

      "“Mainoo still needs to be thinking about how to serve United, but talks about loans away won’t help him. Instead, he might see how Scott McTominay is thriving in Italy, the league’s best player. Mainoo must see that and feel tempted to explore a similar opportunity.”",

      "Second, far too much has changed over the summer for it to be a seamless integration; a lot of mainstays left and other new faces came in as apparent automatic matchday starters. This is not the usual Liverpool way of doing things. Do we look more closely at the board for answers here?",
      "Third, how the hell can the board sack a man who won the league last season? I don’t care about Klopp’s team blah blah blah – He took that team to the top of the league and on an excellent run in the Champions league – not to mention Carabao cup Finalists.",
      "Furthermore to my last point, if the board do part ways with him they must be firmly aware that if the incorrect choice in replacement is made and it fails; which I suspect it would, the fans would turn fully against them. The trues red supporters are far from stupid and blind",
      "And lastly there is light at the end of the tunnel! Mo Salah can take his tired legs off to Afcon and a rejig of the team can be done on the right hand side. Konate can spend some time on the bench and see the errors of his ways and absence of interest from Real Madrid. The right backs can start to fight over their places productively and the team will find its balance because thats all this is balance and belief!",

      "His insistence on starting certain players, even when they have been poor and almost detrimental to our play is frustrating. How demotivating it must be for those on the bench to see such dismal performance and the gaffer continuing to pick them regardless.",
      "I don’t want Slot out. I still hope he can turn it around, but he needs to take some tough decisions or the mounting pressure with such heavy losses might just sound his death knell.\nAbhinav, Mumbai (YNWA)",
      "",
      "This week we saw an impressive team display by a team from Merseyside where they showed a clear collective desire to fight for the good of the team, working tirelessly in that regard whilst having a clear incisive plan about how to attack the opposition – it’s just a shame to me that the team in question wore blue ( .. a genuine congratulations to the toffees for a performance that they can be rightly proud of against Man Utd).",
      "Which leads me to the crux of this mail – where is the collective fight to overcome adversity within this Liverpool team that we are watching this season?",
      "I have always felt across my many decades of supporting Liverpool that the collective spirit/battling qualities are part of our DNA and therefore a given. Recent viewings appear to be bringing this into question.",
      "That is not to say that if we solve that particular aspect that everything else will just fall into place – it feels to me that there are many layers to our current malaise (layers may be the wrong term here … perhaps a tangled ball of wool is more apt).",
      "Let me briefly comment on one or two (but not all !) of those key aspects as I see it:",
      "From a squad balance perspective there appears to have been a questionable prioritisation of transfer funds across the summer that has led to a situation where we are too thin in defensive areas. I can’t complain about the purchase of Wirtz as he looks to be an incredibly gifted footballer, but one who is struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the premier league as things stand (still feel he’ll likely come good though). What would also help is him having a clearer role in the team in terms of where he plays – I am not saying we have to build the team around him, but it does feel like the opposite has happened with Slot’s decisions to shunt him around to different positions.",
      "You won’t get many Liverpool fans complaining about Ekitike, but the manner in which the Isak saga played out after his signing just feels that we got suckered into a ‘whose got the biggest d*ck’ contest with Newcastle and ended up spending top dollar for an ingredient that we may not have explicitly needed – as others have pointed out, there appears to have been no winners as things stand from that soap opera of a signing.",
      "So that’s £125m that could perhaps have been repointed to other key areas, namely defensive spine, and I include the No6 position in that.",
      "We have a scenario at the moment where our CB’s are not performing individually / collectively to the standards previously set, yet there appears to be no consequence to them for that – they effectively know that they are going to be starting the next game. Quite what Gomez has to do to get a start in the prem is beyond me – Slot says he is not match fit / sharp, yet fails to enlighten us as to how he can solve that whilst giving him no game time.",
      "I very much hope that Marc Guehi ends up being a Liverpool player, the sooner the better.",
      "Liverpool’s midfield have been off it this year – lacking aggression and togetherness – and providing a weakened shield to a more troubled defence (= goals against).",
      "I have said it in previous mails that I would like Liverpool to get a decent No6 to improve our options and add a bit of needed steel (Ederson from Atalanta would be an ideal).",
      "… but the summer money was spent elsewhere.",
      "Lastly, thoughts about how the team is being led currently.",
      "I’ve previously said that Slot has tried to integrate too many different new ingredients into the team stew whilst expecting the overall outcome to taste the same – previous experience both inside and outside the club should have told him that was perhaps a little naïve.",
      "He appears to be quite stubborn in some of his continued selections of certain new players who appear to be struggling form wise (eg. Kerkez), when I feel an alternative blanket approach should have been adopted, namely that each new player should have come to the club on the broad understanding that they had to earn their place in the team. Robertson should have played ahead of Kerkez until form dictated otherwise. Bradley (when fit !) should start at RB.",
      "The one new player who answered that form call in spades is Ekitike, and he finds himself marginalised in favour of a more expensive and currently less effective alternative (sigh).",

      "As another mailboxer recently penned, the definition of stupid is to do the same thing over and over again and to expect different results.",
      "He has to show the backbone to drop out of form players – Salah should be watching Chiesa run around on the pitch rather than the other way round (although Salah isn’t doing a great deal of running at the mo !). Drop Konate for Gomez in the short term.",
      "To make an omelette, first you have to break some eggs.",
      "Where is the youth pathway currently ? (Quansah and Elliott have been jettisoned .. Rio not getting hardly any minutes) – without the flow of talent up the line from the youth setup, future transfer windows become far more expensive.",
      "If he can’t solve this, then it feels to me that Liverpool’s next full-time manager will be a Spanish bloke whose surname starts with a vowel.",
      "If the club hierarchy cherish Alonso as they appeared to in the run up to Klopp departing, they may have the patience to wait to see how the current arrangement at Real Madrid plays out and see if there is a possibility at the end of the season (nothing immediate).",
      "Iraola really interests me and clearly has something about him – there is plausible potential for that to happen mid-season, unlike Alonso, so if Liverpool decide to let Slot go mid-season it will be very telling if they seek a temporary manager until the end of the season (which will indicate favouring Alonso) or whether they go all out to get a permanent replacement in.",

While not all of the players and staff at the Lakers had played with Kobe and he wasn’t in his prime I’m sure the shadow of his loss stretched over the season. How did they respond? They won the championship. IF Liverpool were flying right now I am sure that would be the narrative. The ‘this means more’ drum would be beaten, the team would be speaking about it in the press. Instead it appears poor squad building as much as anything has disrupted their season. I’m not discounting the impact of grief.

      "So the Pittsburgh Pirates were a dominate team in the early 70s. They won their NL division three years consecutively with records of 89-73 (1970), 97-65 (1971) and 96-59 (1972), and won the 1971 World Series (I know…it’s called what it’s called).",
      "Then on Dec 31, 1972, Roberto Clemente, a true talisman for the Pirates who had been at the club for 18 years, died in a plane crash while on mercy mission to deliver aid and food to Nicaragua after a massive earthquake. He chartered the airplane himself and packed it with emergency supplies. I’ll let the good people at Wikipedia fill you in:",
      "“Clemente visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.",
      "The airplane which he chartered for the New Year’s Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds (1,900 kg). It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Clemente was baseball GOAT conversation material from an on-field performance perspective and a saint of a humanitarian.",
      "What happened to the Pirates? Well the club and his adopted city of Pittsburgh were devastated. Many of Clemente’s teammates traveled to Puerto Rico to be with his family and his buddy Manny Sanguillén even personally went to the crash site and literally dove in the water to participate in recovery efforts.",
      "And the aftermath: the Pirates tanked in 1973, going 80-82 and finishing 3rd in the NL East after winning the division 3 years in a row. In 1974 they returned to winning ways topping their division in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and capped off a productive decade by winning the World Series in 1979.",
      "There is another baseball player, the New York Yankee’s Thurmon Munson, who also died in an airplane crash in August of 1979 – won’t share the whole story – but the Yankees had won their AL division and consecutive World Series in 1977 & 1978, but finished 1979 in 4th place in their division, way out of contention.",
      "MLB baseball teams play 162 game seasons, so that’s a lot of datapoints to establish trends of causative and correlative relationships.",
      "It’s no revelation that personal grief impacts humans in profound ways, but the sudden loss of a beloved teammate and “brother in arms” has happened before in elite sport and while it’s difficult to calculate/quantify the effect from a human perspective, you can see it on the pitch/baseball diamond, and it’s real.",
      "There are fans in Pittsburgh and New York still alive and old enough to remember the trauma of losing Clemente and Munson…and they probably would assume YNWA is a rap band, but YNWA is felt in spirit by the many who love their sports teams and have been through a grieving process similar to yours.

I would slightly disagree with Ian Wright that it is solely racially motivated when black players are criticised. I think the UK press has, on the whole, an issue with people, black/white/ whatever, that they perceive as above their station, too big for their boots, especially where they think that station feels like it has not been fully earned (same papers will have no problem with the royals mind).

      "Gonzalez is definitely improving, and any midfielder is a downgrade on the 2024 Ballon d’Or winner, but Pep Guardiola will have expected more from the £50million January signing.",
      "Anderson is Premier League-proven and looks the real deal. Not only has he been terrific for Forest, but he has also established himself as a regular in Thomas Tuchel’s England starting XI.",
      "He’d be a top signing for City, and according to the Daily Mail, Guardiola’s side are ‘ready to make Anderson one of their top targets in 2026’ and are now ‘ahead of’ Manchester United in the race for his signature.",
      "City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, and Guardiola are huge admirers of the 23-year-old and have sent scouts to watch him this season.",
      "It’s believed Forest ‘will reject any advances in January’ and think they can hold out for £100m after the World Cup. The minimum expectation is £80m for Anderson, who appeals to City because he can play as both a No.6 and No.8.",
      "Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has also been targeted by City, but they are now more interested in the Forest star.",

      "Anderson’s pathway into the starting XI was blocked by Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton, while Eddie Howe also had Lewis Miley and Joe Willock at his disposal.",
      "The midfielder wasn’t pushing to leave but wanted regular football. When the opportunity to join Forest arose, he took it, and the Magpies were happy to oblige.",
      "His exit was regarded as nothing more than a PSR sham, with Greek goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos moving in the opposite direction in a separate deal worth ‘£20m’.",
      "Anderson’s transfer fee on paper was £35m, but it was effectively a £15m move when you accounted for the Odysseas deal.",
      "At the time, £35m looked laughable. Now he’s worth around triple that.",
      "Not only would Anderson be perfect for this disjointed Newcastle team, with Joelinton declining, Miley showing little progression, and Ramsey and Willock injury-prone, but they will be devastated to have let a £100m midfielder, who came through their academy, leave for £15m.",
      "They absolutely f***ed it. But nobody thought they had at the time. And Newcastle’s hands were tied by the Premier League’s financial rules; they felt they had little choice but to cash in for pure profit.",

      "“Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford’s a big pitch. It’s a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "“I’d say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don’t like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "“He’s come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I’d like to see all three of them.",
      "“I’d probably say I’d go Wharton. I still don’t think they’re any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they’re more the style of football these days.",

      "“He [Amorim] possibly doesn’t trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn’t the most physical, but he’s streetwise. He knows the position, he’s done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he’s got that experience.",
      "“Kobbie hasn’t quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he’s going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don’t do that.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage past at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",

      "With a combined xG of 0.05, United completed a second-half turnaround in a game that, before the halftime whistle, offered very little hope for Ruben Amorim's side. The Portuguese boss was critical of their display in the early exchanges in his post-match, saying his side \"cannot play like that in the Premier League\".",
      "Crystal Palace:  Henderson (4), Munoz (5), Richards (6), Lacroix (6), Guehi (6), Mitchell (5), Wharton (6), Kamada (6), Pino (6), Sarr (5), Mateta (7)\n\n\nSubs:  Lerma (5), Nketiah (4), Uche (6), Hughes (6), Devenny (6).\n\n\n Man Utd:  Lammens (5), Dalot (5), Yoro (3), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Amad (6), Casemiro (5), Bruno Fernandes (7), Mbeumo (6), Mount (8), Zirkzee (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Mazraoui (6), Martinez (n/a), Dorgu (n/a), Mainoo (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mason Mount",
      "United were outclassed and outfought by Palace in the opening 45 minutes despite showing early promise when Dean Henderson denied Casemiro an early goal with a smart stop. Amorim watched on as his side generated just 0.01 expected goals without set-pieces.",
      "In a run of play that summed up United's sorry showing, Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta in the area to give away a sure penalty.",
      "Having initially sent Senne Lammens the wrong way, Mateta had to do the same again after being adjudged to have touched the ball twice by VAR.",
      "More chances followed for Palace in the first half with Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw called upon to make huge interventions to prevent further damage.",
      "Amorim could be seen anxiously pacing in the mixed zone during the half-time break, taking a moment before what would have been his most significant talk to his players, hoping to avoid a repeat of Monday's hopeless showing against the 10 men of Everton.",
      "Whatever he said worked, helping United end a run of three without a win to move up to sixth, above Palace who are denied a place in the top four. Amorim also becomes the first United boss to win at Selhurst Park since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020.",
      "Manchester United must figure out a way to overcome their Jekyll and Hyde complex. Ruben Amorim's side were nowhere near it in the first half at Crystal Palace.",
      "They lacked energy, belief and any ideas as they were under the pump at Selhurt Park. But then a moment of magic from Joshua Zirkzee changed it all.",
      "Across the season, United's starts have been fairly positive and where United have typically found their joy.",
      "However, they have failed to sustain their early displays. In recent performances, United have been far more effective in the second half; their problem, though, is their slow starts.",
      "The defensive numbers are where the difference is stark. Across United's first 11 games this season, in the first half, they had an expected goals against of 5.71. This changed in the second half where that number nearly doubled to 11.07.",
      "However, in their last two games, at Palace and in defeat to Everton, United have a first-half expected goals against of 1.26, while after the break, this number massively decreases to 0.26.",
      "It's important to note that in both games United fell behind in the first half, therefore were naturally more attack-minded in the second period.",
      "However, there's a clue in the numbers that Amorim's team are a different side when they go ahead early, like they did eight times in their first 11 league games, compared to when they concede early on.",
      "Perhaps there are signs of complacency in their leads that Amorim has to fix while also finding a way to motivate faster starts.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"It [Joshua Zirkzee's goal] was really important.",
      "\"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half, he struggled in the duels, and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"And we improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. And that is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We played better because Josh played better in the second half.",
      "\"I just said to the players [at half time] we need to be more alive, and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often and I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers a goal right away, you feel that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt his side would come back, Amorim said:",
      "\"I felt that because I had the feeling, if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box.",
      "\"And you can feel it, the way they move, that they were getting tired for the second half.",
      "\"We talked about that and again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling, we had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.\"",
      "\"Ismaila Sarr has been, by far and away, one of Crystal Palace's standout players since he arrived at the club from Marseille in August 2024. The numbers speak for themselves: 66 appearances, 20 goals, 10 assists.",
      "\"But he may well have played his last game of the year for Oliver Glasner's side.",
      "\"The Senegal forward went down under a challenge from Luke Shaw inside the first four minutes at Selhurst Park and made a motion with his hand as if to suggest he had twisted his ankle. He lasted just over half an hour more, before being replaced by Eddie Nketiah.",
      "\"Asked about Sarr's condition in his post-match press conference, Glasner said: \"The ankle is quite swollen, so I think he will miss a few games, maybe the whole time until he goes to AFCON.\"",
      "\"Senegal start their AFCON campaign on December 23, when they face Botswana in Tangier, Morocco. If Pape Thiaw's side make it as far as the final, Sarr would not return to domestic action until late January or early February.",

      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner:",
      "\"What disappointed me? Almost everything.",
      "\"Conceding two goals from set-plays, three of the last four goals being conceded from set-plays. That makes it really frustrating, because I think we played a very good first half, and deserved to have the lead.",
      "\"I can't remember a big chance from open play in the whole game.",
      "\"We are not fresh enough in many games and the energy level dropped, but I think we made it just harder for us because we conceded these two goals.",
      "\"In the situation we are in now, it looked like it was tough, but I think, at the end, we tried everything.",
      "\"We had a few set-plays as well, an even better situation, the free-kick. But we missed it, they took it, and so that's why we lost it.\"",

      "Speaking ahead of Sunday's Premier League game against Crystal Palace, he said: \"We have some results of not letting a lot of teams in the final third, but we are being really soft near the box so we need to improve that.",
      "\"Especially against Forest - we took a lot of crosses, we didn't press well in that moment. Against Everton, they had 10 men, we cannot suffer a goal but we suffered a goal with the only shot on target.",
      "\"We are there near the box, we have more players than Everton, we should be better. More strong on the duels and Crystal Palace are very strong on duels and when they have to defend, they are really strong.",
      "\"Those things can change how you see teams, but we need to improve in a lot of things. We need to close our goals because we are scoring goals. It's an issue, it's not about the defenders, but about the team and the way we feel our danger near the box.",
      "\"It's not just the numbers. It's Nottingham Forest, to suffer two goals in two minutes after half-time, that's a concern.",
      "\"You are controlling the game against Tottenham and you have the same amount of guys when they score. We are in a good position, but we need to be better and more aggressive. That is my biggest concern.",
      "\"It's the way you see the game and understand that if you're better in this moment, you should have more points and the narrative will be different.\"",
      "After a run of three successive Premier League wins, Man Utd have not won a league game in November, and will be hoping to put this right at Selhurst Park this weekend.",
      "Amorim also pointed out that the pressure to win at Man Utd is more intense than at any other club, and it will take time to find consistency with wins - something not afforded to many.",
      "He added: \"I think it's clear it will take time especially in the Premier League when every club is prepared for everything. They are improving a lot.",
      "\"We need to win now. If not, something is going to change and we know that. We just need to be better.",
      "\"Look at our games - could we have won last game? Yes. We had everything to win it. Same thing against Forest, they were suffering, we had three unbeaten and we didn't win. Tottenham the same.",
      "\"It's the urgency of winning. It's not good to be at United and not winning - there is no time here. That's why I'm frustrated all the time. We know we need time, but there is no time here so let's do everything to win games.\"",
      "There were also questions over Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to find himself with a regular starting spot at Man Utd. He was one of England's shining lights at Euro 2024, but his lack of game time at club level has seen him on the periphery of contention for next summer's World Cup.",
      "On Monday, he played half an hour against Everton, and while Amorim does not rule him out as a starter in the future, his focus is on positive results.",
      "\"This is a team sport. I have a lot of players in my squad, they want to be in the World Cup,\" he said.",
      "\"I put Kobbie [on against Everton] because he's really good near the box. Between Bruno [Fernandes] and him, he can find spaces near the box and score goals so that was my idea.",
      "\"I will use Kobbie and the rest of them to try and win. I'm not focused on one individual, I'm focused on all my players and I know how special it is to play at a World Cup.",
      "\"My job is to win as a team and focus as a team. Kobbie Mainoo is in the same situation as the other guys - if I feel that's best to win the game, I will do it.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other guys. I just have to make a choice and in the end, it's not been Kobbie. In the future, I don't know. I just want to win games, I don't care who is playing.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim dismisses direct comparisons between his Man Utd and Crystal Palace ahead of Sunday's trip to Selhurst Park because, he says, 'we play in a different way' despite shaping up in same 3-4-2-1 formation but he admits Oliver Glasner's side 'are doing things better than us'",
      "Friday 28 November 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",
      "The United boss came under fire for refusing to adapt in Monday's dismal defeat to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, bringing his 3-4-2-1 formation back into the spotlight ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who have enjoyed success playing in the same shape.",
      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",
      "Asked if wing-back is an area he wants to strengthen, Amorim said: \"We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I've said that over the last year.",
      "\"To give an example, in the last game [against Everton], we should have an Amad with the right foot to put on the other side to play against 10 men.",
      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",
      "\"We play in a different way. You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Palace possess a top wing-back in Daniel Munoz, and the Colombia international has previously spoken of his desire to play for Manchester United.",
      "Speaking earlier this month to AS, he said: \"I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another. For me, it would be a dream to play for one of those clubs, whether it's Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that; every day I give it my all so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of these clubs.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. I'm not really aware of what's being said; I don't have any information about whether these teams want me or are interested in me.",
      "\"We'll see when the winter transfer window approaches.\"",
      "Glasner defended Amorim's system ahead of the game and said he had seen an improvement in United this season.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front. Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Amorim admits he would have preferred to bring on a more attacking alternative to Dalot at Everton with no other options available on his bench, but stuck with the same shape nonetheless.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 09:19, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "\"I see the ideal Manchester United midfielder as being able to do everything.\"",
      "The words of former Old Trafford metronome, Paul Scholes.",
      "United's midfield remains a problem. Ruben Amorim's system continues to be drawn into question, a set-up with its frailties further scrutinised as a result of an insistence on leaving two players anchoring in the middle of the park.",
      "Whether it be personnel or instruction, United's inability to consistently control games continues to cost them.",
      "In a test of Amorim's system against 10-man Everton on Monday night, United had very few answers. Instead, Amorim's rare unbeaten run of five matches fell to a dismal end as United were outplayed, outfought and outthought.",
      "With 718 appearances for United, 155 goals and a trophy haul to rival most English football clubs, very few have taken to the Old Trafford midfield like Scholes once did.",
      "As he sat in central London, given an opportunity to mull over the past ahead of a live event for his podcast, The Good the Bad and The Football, being asked \"What makes a Manchester United midfielder?\", the proverbial gears began to turn.",
      "\"It's a little bit different when I played because you hear these number 6s, number 8s, number 10s, I suppose, come into that midfield role as well,\" Scholes says.",
      "\"You can attack, you can defend, you can be part of everything. That's your job as a midfield player for Manchester United.\"",
      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",
      "Kobbie Mainoo emerged as a key player for Erik ten Hag when he made his debut in 2023. That 'Everton debut' that fans reminisce about didn't see him deployed as a No 10, nor as a No 8. Instead, an 18-year-old Mainoo was United's deepest midfielder when he impressed.",
      "An England debut followed in the summer, where at the 2024 European Championship, England's performances improved when Mainoo started alongside Rice as a No 8 as the competition drew on.",
      "Mainoo started the Euro final for England but just two camps later, found himself hurled into the shadows as Rice's partner gained new suitors. Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",
      "\"I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",
      "One thing is for certain, though, United will continue the season, waiting for the midfielder that \"can do everything\".",

      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has come to the defence of Ruben Amorim's infamous system but highlights the key difference in his side.",
      "Glasner uses the same 3-4-2-1 formation as Amorim, yet Palace sit fifth in the Premier League heading into the weekend after an impressive start to their season.",
      "Meanwhile, following a dismal display and result against 10-man Everton, United have slumped to 10th in the league having gone three games without a victory, with Gary Neville among the critics over Amorim's approach.",
      "Palace welcome Amorim's side to Selhurst Park on Sunday, having beaten United on three of the last four occasions. It's a run against United that included a 2-0 win at Old Trafford last season when a Jean-Philippe Mateta brace sunk Amorim's side.",
      "Despite United's poor recent form and a staunch critique of Amorim's formation, Glasner has pointed to the underlying numbers to defend the United boss.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Palace also rank among the top clubs for expected goals this season, however, Glasner suggests his deployment of the 3-4-3 formation allows his side to defend better, with the Eagles second only to Arsenal with the fewest goals conceded.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner added.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a very good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"So it's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are. I'm really looking forward to the game.\"",
      "While the formation is the same, Amorim believes the two interpretations are different. United's Portuguese boss admitted that Palace are better at performing their system.",
      "\"We play in a different way,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Asked if he is inspired by Glasner, Amorim added: \"I played against him in Frankfurt with Sporting, so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I take two weeks for an international break, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration I can.",
      "\"I have six years as a professional manager, so I am always trying to learn.\"",
