      "Manchester United may be left ruing what might have been after two of their former players were sold for fees totalling almost £100million. The Red Devils are desperately looking to revamp their squad following a torturous 2024/25 campaign.",
      "In recent seasons, United have been blighted by numerous missteps in the transfer market, with a string of expensive signings failing to live up to their price tags. The club is trying to move on some of those misfits to fund fresh arrivals and maintain headroom when it comes to PSR restrictions.",
      "Only Matheus Cunha has arrived from Wolves this summer, while exhaustive talks with Brentford over another striker, Bryan Mbeumo, continue after at least two rejected bids. To add insult to injury, United have seen two players they let go relatively cheaply flourish and go on to secure big-money transfers elsewhere.",
      "Anthony Elanga, 23, who United sold to Nottingham Forest for £15million two years ago, has just joined Newcastle United in a £55m deal. Elanga made 55 appearances for United but was deemed surplus to requirements by then-head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "United did retain an interest in the Swedish winger in the form of a sell-on fee related to profit, which means they will reportedly net £6million. While that is a useful sum, United may have been the club reaping the benefits of his potential instead of a direct rival.",
      "Another ex-United player is on the move, Alvaro Carreras, who has left Benfica for Real Madrid in a deal worth £43m. The left-back, 22, was previously part of Real's youth set-up before joining United in 2020.",
      "However, again under Ten Hag's watch, he was allowed to leave for Benfica, initially on loan, before sealing a permanent move for just £5m. United's interest was retained in two ways: a sell-on fee related to profit and a buy-back option, reports Fabrizio Romano.",
      "United opted not to trigger the buy-back clause, although they are said to have received around £7.6m as part of Real’s purchase. Again, United’s decision not to keep or trigger their buy-back option now looks questionable, given that he now resides with the 15-time European champions.",
      "Meanwhile, with just a month to go before the start of the Premier League season, Mbeumo remains a Brentford player, with the two clubs seemingly no closer to striking a deal. United are believed to have offered in excess of £60m - £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons.",
      "However, the Bees are said to be demanding a fixed fee that surpasses the £62.5m that United paid Wolves for Cunha. The inpass adds to the frustration of Amorim, who is eager to get as much business done as soon as possible so he can integrate new players into his squad during an intense pre-season campaign. The Red Devils begin their Premier League campaign against last season's runner-up, Arsenal, on Sunday, August 17.",

      "Tottenham have hired a number of former Manchester United executives who were axed earlier this year as part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's major cost-cutting efforts. Ratcliffe has gone to extreme lengths to save money since taking full control of football operations after buying a share in the club.",
      "That includes scrapping staff lunchboxes, cancelling a staff Christmas party and axing Sir Alex Ferguson's ambassadorial deal. United have also had several rounds of redundancies and some of the staff who were cut have now joined Tottenham.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Spurs have agreed a deal with agency Altius8, which was set up by former United commercial executives Ali Edge, Thomas Liston-Jones and Victoria Timpson in February.",
      "Edge spent 29 years at United and was largely tasked with retaining commercial deals, while Liston-Jones was the club's head of data and strategy. Timpson spent 16 years at Old Trafford and was chief executive of global alliances and partnerships before her departure earlier this year.",
      "The report states that Florence Lafaye, who briefly succeeded Timpson after she left the club, is also involved with Altius8. And Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is said to be hopeful that they can 'have the same transformative effect on the club's revenues as the team did at United.'",
      "The report also claims that those within the industry believe Altius8's involvement at Tottenham could cause embarrassment for Ratcliffe after 'dismantling what was one of the few unqualified successes of the Glazer era'.",
      "However, Ratcliffe has repeatedly defended the cost-cutting and claimed that United would have gone bust by the end of the year if they had not made cuts. \"I don't enjoy reading the newspaper very much these days I have to say,\" Ratcliffe told BBC Sport in March.",
      "\"I know it's unpopular, and this period of change is uncomfortable for people, and some of the decisions we have to make are unpleasant. But they are necessary to put Manchester United back on to a stable footing.",
      "\"If people want to see Manchester United winning trophies again then we have do all this stuff. Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put $300m (£232.72m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer.",
      "\"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\"",

      "Real have paid that amount after Carreras contributed four goals and five assists in 52 matches for Benfica last season. He spent time in Real’s academy in the past and will now play on the opposite side of defence to Trent Alexander-Arnold in Xabi Alonso’s side, competing with Ferland Mendy for a place in the starting XI.",

      "Manchester United’s Portuguese trio travelled to Anfield to pay their respects to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva on Monday. United manager Ruben Amorim, captain Bruno Fernandes and defender Diogo Dalot added a wreath to the hundreds outside Liverpool’s stadium.",
      "Liverpool star Jota, 28, died alongside his 25-year-old brother in a horrific car crash in Spain earlier this month. Their deaths have shocked the footballing world, prompting an outpouring of emotion that has gone well beyond club rivalries.",
      "Both Fernandes and Dalot attended the funerals of their Portuguese compatriots in their homeland on July 5 and were then given additional time off by United. They were part of the Portugal squad, alongside Jota, who won the Nations League, beating Spain on penalties in the final.",
      "They were accompanied by Amorim to lay a wreath with red and white flowers, with a note which read: “Rest in peace, Diogo and Andre. With deepest condolences from everyone at Manchester United.”",
      "Wearing dark clothes, the trio added the United wreath to the masses of flowers and mementos that have been left by Liverpool fans and members of the public outside Anfield.",
      "It comes after Liverpool played their first game since the tragic news, facing Preston in a pre-season friendly at Deepdale. The Reds, who have retired Jota’s No.20 shirt number, won the game on Sunday 3-1 thanks to goals from Conor Bradley, Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo amid emotional scenes.",
      "\"Nothing seems to be important if we think of what has happened,\" said Slot ahead of the game. \"But we are a football club and we need to train and we need to play again, if we want it or not.",
      "\"What I’ve said to the players, I can say it here as well. It’s very difficult to find the right words because we constantly debate what is appropriate. What is appropriate in our actions? What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there’s a wrong decision?",
      "\"And I’ve said to them, maybe the best thing for us to do is handle this situation like Jota was. And what I meant with that is that Jota was always himself, it didn’t matter if he was talking to me, to his teammates, to the staff, he was always himself.”",
      "Fernandes paid tribute to Jota on social media in the aftermath of the car crash. \"Friend, colleague and companion in a thousand battles,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "\"It is difficult to understand how it is possible for someone to leave so soon. May you and your brother find the peace you need to look after those you lost so soon and suddenly. My condolences to your entire family.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dalot wrote: \"Devastating... speechless... much strength to the family.\" Other United players shared their condolences too.",
      "Harry Maguire wrote: “So sad. RIP. Heartbreaking.” Mason Mount added: “Absolutely devastating news. Rest in peace Diogo and Andre. Deepest condolences and thoughts are with the family.”",
      "Amad wrote: “My sincere condolences to Jota’s Family and his Wife. We are all devastated by this news. May their souls rest in peace.” Joshua Zirkzee said: \"Unbelievable news... rest in perfect paradise, prayers to your loved ones.\""

      "Amorim could only guide his side to 15th in the table last season, and will be pleased to have some extensive time to work with his players and to implement his tactics without interruption. United are already a week into their work and new signing Matheus Cunha has participated in his first session at at Carrington.",
      "Work and testing has been conducted in the gym and the training pitch has seen its first action before the club's summer tour begins. Leeds United await in Stockholm before Amorim's squad takes off to the United States to take on West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",

      "Not exactly part of Amorim's remit, but the Portuguese coach wanted the club's hierarchy to have his squad in place in time for the pre-season tour. The 40-year-old sees the period as an important opportunity for players to integrate into the group and to take on board his methods.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's arrival would see another goalscoring threat added to United's forward line. Brentford are still awaiting a third bid from United and the Red Devils can make no mistake if they do not want to have a detrimenal impact on Amorim's plans.",
      "The possibility of signing a new goalkeeper has long been anticipated at Old Trafford but with the injury of Andre Onana has taken on greater significance. Back-up option Altay Bayindir's future must be decided, and Amorim must choose who he trusts to start in goal with Onana potentially missing the start of the season.",

Pre-season is about building momentum after all, rather than putting people's noses out of joint.",
      "It could also provide an opportunity for some of the club's young talent to leave an impression. That could include defender Godwill Kukonki, who is set to sign his first professional deal, and Leeds could provide a testing ground to make such decisions.",

      "\"In the end, we want to be successful. Last season they won the Premier League so my goal is for sure to win it again and also to go further in the Champions League. I’m really ambitious.\"",
      "Wirtz said choosing Liverpool was the \"next step\" he needed to take in his career, adding: \"I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts.",
      "\"I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League. I will see how I can perform there. I hope I can do my best.",
      "\"I just thought that it was the right point in my career to make the next step and of course I wanted to get to a club that is from the top three in the world. In my opinion, Liverpool is one of them. I just saw myself in the best hands in Liverpool.\"",
      "Wirtz joins former Leverkusen team-mate Jeremie Frimpong, Hungarian defender Milos Kerkez and Georgian and ex-Valencia shotstopper Giorgi Mamardashvili as the Reds newest faces this summer as Slot looks to defend the Premier League title next season."

      "Manchester United are looking to revamp their squad this summer as they hope to bounce back from their worst ever Premier League campaign. The Red Devils finished 15th last season and Ruben Amorim wants to make some major changes.",
      "However, they have only made on major signing so far with Matheus Cunha joining from Wolves and Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have departed after their contracts expired. Plenty more incomings and outgoings are expected before the window slams shut.",
      "Rashford has been informed he is not in Ruben Amorim's plans, having spent the second half of last season out on loan at Aston Villa after he was frozen out by the Portuguese. The forward's representatives want to know what United are willing to accept to let him leave.",
      "Rashford is prepared to compromise on the terms of a pay-off in order to facilitate a move, but it is understood that he is more likely to leave on loan again with Barcelona among the clubs interested.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has turned down the chance to join his idol and former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr, according to the Telegraph.",
      "Garnacho has been told to find a new club this summer and was approached by Al-Nassr. However, the 21-year-old has rebuffed their interest as he would prefer to join another European club.",
      "Chelsea and Napoli have both been linked with Garnacho in the past, but it remains to be seen what the future holds for the forward.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants a deal for Bryan Mbeumo finalised before Manchester United's pre-season tour of the US begins on July 22.",
      "Brentford have already rejected two offers for the forward, who netted 20 Premier League goals last season and was only outscored by Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland, and are holding out for more than the £62.5m United paid for Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo is also not happy with the move continuing to drag on, with Cameroon's assistant coach Ashu Cyprian Besong telling Telecom Asia : \"Yes, obviously he's very frustrated with how long it's taken.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Have a glance at the first team section of the Manchester United website and their biggest problems are buried at the bottom of the pile.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, names without squad numbers, are the last two players on the list. Above them are Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "There are a whopping 33 players on that page. We can omit the aforementioned quartet and Tyrell Malacia from the actual senior squad. Dan Gore and Ethan Wheatley cannot be considered first-teamers and it is premature to assign Tyler Fredricson that status, despite his recent squad number upgrade.",
      "Diego Leon's profile has been uploaded to the first team page but the 18-year-old's first year is expected to be akin to Sekou Kone's. One of acclimatisation with scant opportunities at senior level.",
      "So the number is whittled down to a lean 24 players, an ideal size for a season without European nights on the calendar. Yet sellable assets cannot just be written off.",
      "Rashford, Antony, Sancho and Garnacho collectively rake in £825,000-a-week. They are all still on United's books and the chances are they all still will be going into August.",
      "It is improbable that United will sell all four. Garnacho has takers and Sancho cannot command that high a fee after four feckless years and with a year remaining on his contract. Antony has created a market but his profitability and sustainability-calculated value (£32.58m) is unlikely to be coughed up by a buying club.",
      "Antony may have to embark on a season-long loan with a fixed fee to be paid at the end of it, minus a Sancho-style loophole. Rashford's salary, the three years left on his contract and pickiness over a change of scenery make a loan inevitable.",
      "Rashford did a four-hour gym session on Monday morning. His Instagram posts over the summer have consisted almost entirely of fitness videos. He has also conducted individual sessions at Carrington. He is trying to catch the eye.",
      "The chances are United will still be footing some of the bill for two prominent forwards heading into next season. Then they have two strikers they have invested £108.5million in, a high-profile teenage striker promoted to the first team nearly six months ago and five players who can operate as a No.10. They are more stockpiled than an Ikea warehouse.",
      "Any speculation that United are about to promptly recruit a striker is unrealistic when their attacking department is so bloated and expensive. Liam Delap was a convenient option as he had a low release clause and played for a relegated club more enthusiastic about promoting Ed Sheeran concerts than remaining in the Premier League.",
      "Sources say United's new director of football, Jason Wilcox, is well liked by staff members and widely respected. Sir Jim Ratcliffe said Wilcox possesses the \"best eyes in football\". He did not look far for Delap, a player he watched in the Manchester City academy when he was director there.",
      "United are still burnt from the £72m package they agreed with Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund, bought for an up-front fee of £64m two years ago. Whilst United were in negotiations with Atalanta, one of the coaching staff members admitted they would not be able to spend £60m on another striker the following summer.",
      "When United needed another striker last year, they had to compromise and paid a release clause for Joshua Zirkzee, who cost roughly half the price that Hojlund did at £36.5m. It then turned out Zirkzee is not a specialist striker.",
      "United have been linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike but there was nothing concrete. Both players are now seemingly bound for Arsenal and Newcastle United, Premier League clubs that qualified for the Champions League. United informed Christopher Nkunku's representatives they are nowhere near as keen as his parent club, Chelsea, claimed.",
      "Expect the Google search interest for Benjamin Sesko to spike this week now he is the last high-profile and attainable striker waiting in the wings. Sesko rejected United in 2022 to sign for RB Leipzig but his agent has since paid multiple visits to Old Trafford and Carrington.",
      "Sesko, under contract until 2029, would command at least double the fee United were prepared to pay for Delap. United have eight senior out-and-out forwards and the majority are on six-figure weekly salaries. The numbers, for a club that confessed their struggles to comply with PSR to a supporters' group, do not add up.",
      "Guaranteed sales are all the more pressing now the price of a No.9 has gone up. Reinventing Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo (if he ever arrives) as an out-and-out striker would be a complete cop-out.",
      "Persevering with Hojlund would be blind faith. Senior figures at United spoke critically of Hojlund last season, anticipating a possible departure this summer. Inter Milan enquired about the Dane in June.",
      "The wait for a striker will likely stretch towards the transfer deadline of September 1. United's priority purchase is often one of the last through the door (Manuel Ugarte in 2024, Hojlund in 2023, Casemiro in 2022 and Harry Maguire in 2019).",
      "United finished the last two seasons with a minus goal difference. It was literally ten times worse in 2024-25 than the previous campaign. The nock of the arrow has to be sharpened.",
      "But there are problems at the bottom of the pile to address first."

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in management was replete with not just one more Premier League title but one more banning of a journalist.",
      "It was actually two journalists. Mark Ogden and Paul Hetherington were deemed personas non grata for having the temerity to report that Rio Ferdinand would miss Manchester United's first game of the season at Everton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis forced Ferguson to relocate Michael Carrick to centre back alongside Nemanja Vidic on his first appearance in eight months. United lost to a Marouane Fellaini header from a corner at Goodison Park.",
      "It was peculiar that Ferguson, in his seventies and into his 27th year managing United, operated as though journalists were on the club payroll. As recently as December, there was dismay among some of the United online fanbase that this correspondent had obtained the starting XI for the Manchester derby at the Etihad the day before kick-off.",
      "On that occasion, the United manager and staff were nonplussed as team news leaks have gone on for years at the club. Jose Mourinho marvelled at journalists' sourcing but was appalled that someone privy to such information was loose-lipped.",
      "David Moyes vainly attempted to counter team news leaks when he correctly identified the leaker - a senior member of the first team squad. Louis van Gaal's goalkeeping coach, Frans Hoek, followed specific journalists on Twitter after they reported on acrimony in the squad. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag were blasé about early team news entering the public domain.",
      "The appetite for team news has become more insatiable amid the growing popularity of fantasy football. Participants want to be certain of who's in and who's out before the Saturday 11am deadline to pick their teams.",
      "Ruben Amorim has named an unchanged team only once as United coach, away at Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals after the goalless draw with Manchester City at Old Trafford. Rotation was rife as United progressed in that tournament and their league form was sacrificed.",
      "Innumerable injuries meant Ten Hag selected his clear and obvious starting XI only once, at Wolves in February 2024. United were so impressive in the first hour of the exhausting 4-3 win that Ten Hag was visibly unhappy they had not won by a wider margin.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot are two of the most durable players in Europe, never mind England. Noussair Mazraoui, likely to be reduced to squad-player status next term, started in 34 Premier League matches in his first season in the competition.",
      "Injury will prevent Andre Onana from appearing during United's pre-season tour of the United States but he has not missed a league match through injury. United's five specialist centre backs all admittedly endured lengthy injury lay-offs in 2024-25.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is still not a United player but lined up in all 38 of Brentford's matches last term. Brentford played 43 games overall. United are a new striker and Mbeumo short of an obvious first XI.",
      "The United fitness staff has been freshened up. Richard Hawkins has left after 17 years mainly overseeing the team's physical performance and Paolo Gaudino has gone after 14 years as fitness coach. Amorim's compatriot, Paulo Barreira, is leading the club's sports science. Alistair McBurnie and Michael Eglon, relatively recent additions to the sports science department, both remain.",
      "With a lighter workload and greater recovery time between games, United's injury toll should be lower than previous campaigns. That said, the last time they had a year devoid of European football they had such regular injury issues that Van Gaal made light of the fact they had \"only one player injured\" on the eve of the visit of Southampton in January 2015.",
      "There are eerie parallels 11 years on: a United manager's first full season, the team operating in a back three and without a UEFA competition to fill the calendar. Ed Woodward confidently briefed that the injury-prone trio Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans would have their \"most available seasons\" in 2014-15. All three were sidelined six games into the campaign and Paddy McNair had to come into the fold.",
      "A United manager seldom picks the same players in successive weeks. The outlier was when the Premier League season restarted amid the Covid-19 pandemic in June 2020. Solskjaer maximised the three-month suspension by settling on a winning formula that was unchanged in five consecutive league games.",
      "That had not happened since February 1993. Back then, United were galvanised by Eric Cantona and fixated on ending their 26-year title drought. Their European campaign ended in September and they exited the FA Cup at Sheffield United in the midst of the league run.",
      "The closest Ferguson ever got to a sequence of unchanged sides again was in October and November 2006 when he entrusted the same XI in three consecutive league fixtures. The common denominator is the 1992-93 and 2006-07 titles were his greatest domestic triumphs.",
      "Solskjaer's strategy eventually backfired. He would gain a reputation for running players into the ground and, after the 2-2 draw with Southampton, was without a recognisable left back as Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams became two flies to drop. Right back Timothy Fosu-Mensah returned like Lazarus for his first United appearance in more than three years at Crystal Palace.",
      "In Van Gaal's first season, he did not opt for the same XI until Tottenham Hotspur away on December 28 2014, two days after the Boxing Day stroll against Newcastle United. It made little sense with that unforgivingly tight turnaround and Van Gaal admitted after the goalless draw the second half was \"a struggle for life\".",
      "He happened upon a winning formula three months later. With Shaw injured again and the meek Angel di Maria suspended, Van Gaal moved Daley Blind to left back, recalled Jones and Juan Mata and United blitzed Spurs 3-0 in the first half of the reverse fixture. In their next game, United produced what remains their best performance at Anfield in the past 30 years to win 2-1.",
      "Bar an enforced change for the resumption of the season at home to Aston Villa, Van Gaal kept the same side for four games running. The sequence only ended with Vincent Kompany's malicious tackle on Blind and a season-ending calf injury to the pivotal Carrick in the 4-2 defeat of City.",
      "After much trial-and-error with other systems, Van Gaal had switched to a 4-3-3 formation. That was reported by the MEN before it was introduced.",
      "Nobody was banned."

      "Certainly, Brann manager Freyr Alexandersson is a huge fan of the Norway under-21 international. The Icelandic boss, who has worked at clubs in his homeland, as well as Qatar, Denmark and Belgium, described Helland as the 'greatest talent' he has worked with.",

      "\"I think I can say that he is the greatest talent I have ever had. That is my feeling, without wanting to put too much pressure on him. I will protect him as much as I need to, but he is a very big talent and I think he knows that himself.",
      "\"Centre-back is his best position, but for a dominant team like Brann will be, he can develop into a really good six. Without wanting to make headlines about it, he reminds me a bit of Rodri.",
      "\"If you see how Rodri developed as a 'six', Eivind Helland has many of the same qualities. It may be that at some point I will give him a few games as a six.\"",

      "United have prioritised attacking signings this summer and want to sign Mbeumo and a centre-forward in addition to Cunha. However, United need to sell players in order to bring in new faces.",
      "Although the likes of Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are waiting in the departure lounge in search of an exit, United are yet to receive a concrete offer for any of them. Patience will be key.",
      "When the summer transfer window opened on June 1, United set a target of a minimum of five signings: three attackers, a midfielder and a goalkeeper. Unsurprisingly, attacking signings have taken priority.",
      "As it stands, Cunha is the only new face who will be guaranteed a spot in the starting XI come the start of the Premier League season next month. Mbeumo will also demand the same treatment if he eventually secures a move to Old Trafford.",
      "With that said, if United land Mbeumo in the coming days or weeks, he and Cunha will go straight into the starting XI to face Arsenal on the opening day of the season in just over a month's time. Cunha is a guaranteed starter as the left-sided No.10, but Mbeumo's starting position is less clear cut.",
      "The 25-year-old, who scored 20 Premier League goals last term, will be forced to adapt to a new formation at Old Trafford, but he is a realistic candidate to play as either the right-sided No.10 or out wide as the right wing-back.",
      "If Mbeumo is unleashed as the right-sided No.10 by Amorim, Amad should start as the right wing-back. If the former is preferred on the flank, Amad will play as the No.10.",
      "Should United land Mbeumo, they will be two thirds of the way towards developing their attack. They desperately want a striker to come in and spearhead their attack, meaning Rasmus Hojlund, should he remain at the club this summer, will be demoted to the bench.",
      "As things currently stand, the Dane is still United's chief striker. However, he will face competition from fellow countryman Chido Obi this pre-season.",
      "If United can get Mbeumo and a striker through the door, the only other area in Amorim's starting XI that will be in desperate need of attention will be the centre of midfield. The Reds have made no secret of their desire to sign a midfielder this summer, but the characteristics of that player are shaping up to be quite important.",
      "Cunha's addition to the squad means captain Bruno Fernandes is increasingly likely to operate as a midfielder more often than not in 2025/26. He regularly dropped into the engine room in the second half of last season and was arguably more influential than he was previously as a No.10.",
      "Having a player as attack-minded as Fernandes in one of the two No.8 positions means United must strike the right balance in midfield. Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are the current contenders to partner the skipper, but there is an obvious need for fresh blood amid Ugarte's struggles on the ball, Mainoo being too attack-minded to complement Fernandes and Casemiro's decline over the last two years.",
      "If United can find the right midfielder to partner Fernandes, Amorim's ideal XI will be in good shape. Of course, other areas have room for improvement, but it is unrealistic to suggest every position can be upgraded this summer.",
      "If United can land themselves a midfielder, a striker and Mbeumo by the end of the window on September 1, the summer will be considered a success. However, much of it will depend on sales coming to fruition in the coming weeks."

      "Haaland and Kane are cause for great regret. United missed out on the former in December 2019 and did not have the nerve to go for the latter two years ago. Since Haaland moved to Borussia Dortmund, the only reputable strikers United have bought were Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo, aged 33 and 36 at the time of their arrivals. Each only cut it for one season.",
      "Now United are at risk of settling for potential when they require a proven commodity. Hugo Ekitike, of Eintracht Frankfurt, is hardly a spring chicken - he is older than Rasmus Hojlund - but not the ideal profile and seemingly bound for Newcastle United anyway.",
      "United have still not concluded a deal for the Premier League's joint-fourth highest scorer last season, Bryan Mbeumo. Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha claimed 35 league goals between them last season but woe betide United if they rewrite the script and attempt to rebrand either of them as a specialist striker.",

      "There are not many strikers who fit the bill.",
      "HE-SAID-SHE-SAID",
      "Some of Marcus Rashford’s acolytes were keen to stress last week that he had not asked to leave United. He did not have to.",
      "Rashford said he was \"ready for a new challenge\" back in December. Rashford said last month he would like to play for Barcelona. No clarification was required.",
      "We can do without the he-said-she-said nonsense regarding a player’s future. United do not miss treading on eggshells around Rashford and Amorim acted decisively after Rashford blanked him in Plzen on December 12.",
      "He is a player without a number now that Cunha has the '10'. United are still remaining diplomatic with Rashford and have emphasised his 20-year history with the club. That privilege has not been extended to Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Rashford jeopardised the harmony of the United squad too often: the brazen birthday party on Deansgate, the Belfast bender and the Plzen flashpoint. Ahead of a new season, United must have a happy camp.",
      "Rashford arrived for an individual training session at Carrington eight minutes after Amorim on Friday via the rear entrance. Amorim left through the front.",
      "Jadon Sancho would have also threatened the mood. He refused to apologise to Erik ten Hag after accusing him of lying and revelled in Rashford’s loan move to Aston Villa with that petulant “Freedom” comment in February.",
      "Sancho has the freedom of movement to find himself a new club, most likely in Italy, a dumping ground for Premier League clubs for several years. Chelsea opted to buy Jamie Gittens, another winger bred in the Manchester City academy who defected to Borussia Dortmund, rather than Sancho. Gittens is five years Sancho's junior.",
      "Ten Hag was ordered to briefly reintegrate Sancho last summer, without the desired apology. He managed the situation respectably and United got Sancho out of the door on transfer deadline day.",

      "The former Liverpool attacker was travelling from Portugal to Santander in northern Spain, where he was due to take the ferry back to England. He had been advised not to fly after recently undergoing a minor operation.",
      "The passing of the two brothers has rocked the world of football, leading to global tributes to the duo. Their funerals took place in Portugal on July 5 and United duo Dalot and Fernandes were present.",
      "The pair, who were teammates of Jota's at international level, were offered an extra week off by United after being expected to report back for pre-season training last week. However, they both reported back to Carrington last Thursday as originally planned.",
      "Liverpool posted a collection of images on their Instagram page on Monday afternoon, showing Amorim, Dalot and Fernandes laying a tribute to Jota outside Anfield.",
      "Images showed Dalot laying a floral tribute on behalf of United. The players, alongside Amorim, also took a few moments to observe all of the tributes that have been laid in memory of the former Wolves star and his brother.",
      "A post shared on Liverpool's Instagram page said: \"Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot and Ruben Amorim have laid a tribute to Diogo Jota and Andre Silva, on behalf of all at Manchester United.",
      "The message on the card on the wreath laid by the trio said: \"Rest in peace, Diogo and Andre. With deepest condolences from everyone at Manchester United.\"",

      "In terms of other potential new signings, there is still nothing more concrete to mention on the rumour mill. United have been heavily linked with signing a striker, but after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres it remains to be seen where they will go next.",
      "There have also been reports that United could sign a new goalkeeper this summer amid speculation around Andre Onana's future. Aston Villa shot-stopper Emi Martinez has been linked with United in recent weeks, but the possibility of a move remains a rumour at this stage.",
      "United could see some players leave the club over the next week, both on permanent deals and on a loan basis. Marcus Rashford is being heavily linked with a move away from United with some suggestions that a loan deal to Barcelona may be on the cards.",

      "Manchester United find themselves in an undesirable position at this current stage of the summer transfer window. With just five weeks until the 2025/26 season, frustrations has set in.",
      "Following their worst season in 51 years that culminated with a lacklustre Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, United were destined for a busy transfer window involving a number of incomings and certain players being sold.",
      "Like every single summer, United have been, or not been, involved in a rather busy period full of speculation and stories linking them with over a hundred players. However, Jadon Wilcox has only managed to sign one player in Matheus Cunha.",
      "His £62.5million release clause was triggered early in the window and he became signing number one. It then became apparent that Bryan Mbeumo was the club's number one target after Cunha with the Brentford star viewed as the perfect partner for the Brazilian.",
      "The Reds opened talks with their Premier League rivals at the start of June and an opening bid worth £55million was rejected. Another offer of £60m then fell short. After a month of very gradual talks, Mbeumo remains a Brentford player and United are not yet to match the Bees' valuation, believed to be around £65m.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Mbeumo is expected to arrive at United this week. It comes after reports last week that the 25-year-old was growing frustrated at the lack of progress. And it seems as though Ruben Amorim is also becoming agitated.",
      "The Mirror have claimed that the United boss wants a deal for Mbeumo finalised before the clubs jet off to the pre-season for the United States on July 22. The Reds face Premier League rivals West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton before returning to the United Kingdom to face Fiorentina.",
      "At the start of the window, it was understood that United wanted Cunha, Mbeumo and a striker signed ready for the pre-season tour. Last summer, United didn't add Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui to Erik ten Hag's squad until August. That didn't work out.",
      "A deadline of getting Mbeumo through the door is a clear message from Amorim. Failure to bring the forward to the club, to allow him time to settle in his new team, would be a major problem.",
      "The additional stress of Amorim also being without a striker is making the matter worse. Unlike their Premier League rivals, United are going into the main part of their pre-season tour without having the bulk of their transfer business done."

      "Signed from Brighton & Hove Albion in a deal that could eventually be worth up to £60million, Pedro has wasted no time in making his mark for the Londoners. He will be hoping he can replicate his success in the US back on home soil once the Premier League season starts next month.",
      "The former Watford man, 23, scored a respectable ten goals and contributed six assists in just 27 league appearances for Brighton last term. After joining Brighton in 2023, he scored 19 goals in 58 league games.",
      "Many will no doubt point out that record is not hardly blistering. What it is, though, is respectable.",

      "United's attack was bereft of creativity and flamboyancy last season, meaning there is already immense pressure on Cunha to make his mark. United, of course, want to continue strengthening their attack this summer with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and a natural striker.",
      "But having spent £62.5m on Cunha, United will expect immediate results from the former Atletico Madrid man. He was one of the best players in the Premier League last season and his experience of playing in a 3-4-2-1 system will hopefully stand him in good stead in M16.",
      "In the eyes of many, the Club World Cup was a competition made up of glorified friendlies and will only be remembered for Trump getting in the way of Chelsea's celebrations. Chelsea fans will, of course, remember other aspects.",
      "However, whatever your thoughts are on the format of the competition and the purpose it served, Pedro's three goals from his first two starts in Chelsea colours have gone down in the record books. Nobody can take them away from him.",
      "Like United, Chelsea have attempted to secure signings from fellow Premier League clubs this summer, swooping for Liam Delap, who was on United's radar before leaving Ipswich Town, and Pedro.",
      "It is worth acknowledging Pedro's first three goals for Chelsea were scored against clubs from Brazil and France, but the club will be confident he can deliver the goods against the domestic competitors in the same way he did at Brighton and previously Watford.",
      "He made an immediate impact in the States, scoring both goals that secured Chelsea's place in the final, and then put the final to bed before half-time with a lovely finish against a team many consider to have been the best in the world this calendar year.",
      "If United witness a similar impact from Cunha, they will only be too happy. Pedro has demonstrated just the sort of start United need from their new Brazilian."

      "We’re still waiting on some stragglers and official releases, so do check back for further updates, but here are our objectively correct rankings of the Premier League’s 25/26 home kits for you to enjoy and not get unnecessarily cross about.",
      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",
      "Big themes for this season include: round collars, local ‘inspiration’ and more immediately obvious divergence between ‘replica’ and ‘authentic’ versions of shirts. We’re not really happy about any of those themes, if we’re honest.",
      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",
      "",
      "TBC. Sunderland\nWe’ve seen a few leaks and they’re mainly terrible, but no confirmation yet for what is actually the kit. It’s hummel, so it should be good. Which is the main reason we’re remaining too sceptical to rank based on those current upsetting leaks.",
      "",
      "19) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",
      "Update your phone wallpaper to celebrate our 2025/26 Home kit 🥳 pic.twitter.com/g6w7rcNGOE",
      "— Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) July 4, 2025",
      "The marketing bullsh*t manifests in a vaguely topographical pattern designed to represent the fact that East Lancashire, famously and uniquely, has some hills in it.",
      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

      "17) Manchester City\nThis is a kit that challenges what had previously been one of our most rigidly and certainly-held kit-based beliefs. And that belief was that sash = good.",
      "And now we don’t know at all. We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm. If we can no longer be sure about sashes on football kits, than what certainties do we have left to cling to?",
      "We don’t think we’re being dramatic when we say this feels like it might be a harbinger of absolute doom for all mankind. Especially in a year that has already featured Spurs winning a trophy and the MCC allowing members not to wear jackets in the Lord’s pavilion just because it was a bit warm.",
      "We expect confirmation that the ravens are leaving the Tower any moment.",
      "And it’s not even like City have plucked a sash from nowhere either. Sure, it’s never been on the home kit before, but they have a proud away-kit sash history that dates well back into the before times of the 1970s and whatnot.",
      "As for an actual final call on whether this kit is brilliant or bad, we shall strive to arrive at a definitive decision within 28 business days.",
      "",
      "16) Brentford\nA new home shirt is an event in itself after they took the now wildly unusual step of keeping the old one for two years. It’s certainly an interesting one to mark the switch from Umbro to Joma, and while we really want to like it, it’s not quite right.",
      "Let’s start with the good. The red and white cuffs and collar are good, as are the pinstripes at the edge of the main stripes. Well done there.",

      "— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) July 4, 2025",
      "We’re not sold on the white sleeves, though. In our view it tilts the balance of red and white too far in favour of white, and not even the primarily red back for the name-sets can quite save that.",
      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",
      "Just sort of drawing a fake one on sadly reduces a shirt that could have been really good to something approaching a novelty. It’s just a little bit too close to ‘humorous T-shirt with a bow-tie drawn on it’ which is a shame.",
      "",
      "15) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",
      "Our new Head Coach 🙌 pic.twitter.com/lS0xDZJMLn",
      "— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 18, 2025",
      "Yet after last year’s Kappa-coded full navy blue sleeves comes this effort. Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",
      "What we can’t get away from – and no, we can’t fully explain this – is that the specific placement of the navy areas means this shirt is giving Bolton to a distracting degree.",
      "",
      "14) Liverpool\nA return to adidas for Liverpool after many years with Nike and based on the plentiful leaks out there it’s a safety-first start to the rekindled relationship, with a low-risk entirely inoffensive shirt that leans heavily on the 2006/07 classic minus the big ol’ flappy collar.",
      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

      "",
      "13) Fulham\nUnofficial for now, but it follows last year’s lead on being a predominantly white effort with far less black than we’ve seen previously. Here it is once again reduced to the adidas stripes, the collar and a bit of piping.",
      "It’s absolutely adequate based on the leaks we’ve seen. While we’re always slightly reluctant to rank on leaks, we’re confident nothing new we could learn about this kit will propel it up or down this list in any significant way.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nWe will always prefer even stripes which puts this latest Bournemouth effort on the back foot from the start. The sand-effect red stripes are already thicker than the black ones here even before further red bordering is added in. A shame, because it’s actually rather good apart from that.",
      "Introducing our 2025/26 Home Kit 🔥 pic.twitter.com/VJXjjtZnEo",
      "— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) July 15, 2025",
      "We’re not even going to bother looking up the PR spiel as it will only annoy us and instead we’ll just go right ahead and assume the sand motif is once again drawing inspiration from the local area and okay, fine, whatever. The gold trim is nicely understated and swerves all accusations of gaudiness. If the thickness of the stripes were sorted out we’d be very happy with this. Not that they asked or care. Honestly, some people.",
      "",
      "11) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

      "— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) July 1, 2025",
      "",
      "10) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",
      "pic.twitter.com/JbimZktGYA",
      "— Everton (@Everton) June 27, 2025",
      "",
      "9) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here if the widespread leaks are anything to go by, with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",
      "A source has leaked the 2025/26 Aston Villa Home Kit, It should officially release inside the next month if this is the actual design. pic.twitter.com/wtRVNHSwQe",
      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "6) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

      "— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) July 12, 2025",
      "5) Nottingham Forest\nWe’re still working from leaks here, so it’s a gamble putting this so high but the pinstripes as well as the shield surrounding the badge and the clear nods to the 92-94 kit mean this has all the hallmarks of an absolute banger.",
      "We reserve the right to alter this ranking if the actual shirt disappoints, but at this stage we’re very excited about this one.",
      "",
      "4) West Ham\nUmbro have done some fine retro work with West Ham in recent years, and it all comes together here in this shiny and powerfully early 80s effort. Even the BoyleSports logo looks like it’s from 1983.",
      "The new home kit – that’s shirt, shorts and socks – in one shot. pic.twitter.com/PdexDvPJo7",
      "— KUMB.com: West Ham United FC Online (@kumbdotcom) July 3, 2025",
      "The return of the full colour club crest is good after last year’s experiment with keeping it to the club’s primary colours, which we didn’t hate but have to now concede doesn’t look as good as this one does.",
      "The striped collars and cuffs are first-rate, and the flashes of blue under the arms are just enough to avoid this falling into the Burnley trap.",
      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nYour mileage may vary, but personally we’re fans of predominantly black trim on a Manchester United shirt, and that feels even more important this year with Liverpool also back in the adidas fold. You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",
      "Happy birthday, Alejandro! 🎉 pic.twitter.com/Zijn0UkTty",
      "— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 1, 2025",
      "This shirt certainly has that, and perhaps our favourite collar of the entire season’s efforts. In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",
      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",
      "Hilarious japes aside, excellent shirt this. Unmistakably United, significantly different to – and we’re going to say better than – Liverpool’s own adidas effort.",
      "",
      "1) Leeds United\nFor some reason that baffles and – if we’re honest – infuriates us, adidas have apparently decided in the last year or so to devote a lot of their very best work to Leeds United.",

The Guardian says ‘preparations for a move are being conducted’ which have to start with a simple question: how much?",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTalks are continuing, apparently, but they haven’t achieved much so far. Ornstein says the clubs remain ‘several million apart’ in their valuation. Brentford don’t seem minded to come down so United will probably have to go up. Surely they won’t just walk away now, leaving the player hanging, wasting weeks of the market? With United, who knows…",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli were ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who could yet be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. But reports over the weekend suggest the Serie A champions have backed away somewhat, preferring instead a £30million deal for Udinese’s Lorenzo Lucca. It could all be part of the transfer dance if Napoli are looking for a sweeter deal from Liverpool, but this certainly doesn;t appear as advanced as it did last week.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Newcastle\nOoh, interesting… this one seems to have exploded in the last 24 hours, with Ekitike’s agents said to be in the North-East to discuss terms with Newcastle. One report puts the fee at around £70million. Which is all very exciting for Newcastle, but two Liverpool-themed concerns linger: The Reds like Ekitike and could yet make their move. And if Newcastle sign the France forward, what does that mean for Alexander Isak’s future? ‘Nothing’, says the North-East press pack, but we’re not entirely convinced.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nBournemouth have agreed to take another Chelsea keeper, this time permanently, with the 25-year-old moving for £25million. Petrovic will have a medical once Chelsea fly back from the United States.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger is at Arsenal today to wrap up a medical and the final details of a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "A deal is ‘still not imminent’ for Bryan Mbeumo as Man Utd and Brentford continue to negotiate a fee for the forward, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein.",

      "The Premier League giants have been bidding for Brentford forward Mbeumo with two offers rejected so far and talks are continuing to get a deal over the line.",
      "However, a report on Monday on Football Transfers claimed that Man Utd have finally ‘reached an agreement with Brentford’ for the signing of Mbeumo.",

      "READ: Isak next? Ten best signings by Premier League champions obviously dominated by Manchester United",
      "It isn’t made clear how much the agreement is for but it’s claimed that the Bees have been ‘firm in their conviction that Mbeumo is worth around €80 million’.",
      "Football Transfers added: ‘Sources have told us that the last remaining issues between Man Utd and Brentford have been resolved and that the transfer is now in the process of being finalised.’.",
      "However, The Athletic’s Ornstein had a very different view on where the potential transfer is at and he insists ‘the two sides are several million pounds apart’.",

      "“If they don’t get him, it’ll be down to the club failing to get the deal down, rather than Mbeumo not wanting to go to Old Trafford. Everyone is saying that the pull of Thomas Frank at Tottenham will make him sign there, but he was happy to leave the manager. He wanted to leave Brentford whilst Frank was still in charge.",
      "“We don’t know if Daniel Levy is a fan of his either, he has a big say over the incomings at the football – that said, they do need something in that front line at Spurs. Heung-min Son has lost that sharpness and they’re lacking in that frontline.”",

      "Arsenal are on the verge of finally signing a Proper Striker in Viktor Gyokeres and sorting a priority position. Liverpool and Manchester United are next.",
      "",
      "10) Crystal Palace and a centre-half\nWhile most executives at Selhurst Park are busy scouring their emails for old messages from UEFA and preparing for trips to Lausanne in the coming days, Crystal Palace must soon put down their Evangelos Marinakis voodoo dolls and instead focus on squad-building.",
      "There is admittedly less work than might have been expected by mid-July, whichever European competition the Eagles land in.",
      "For all the frenzied speculation surrounding their most prized assets, Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi, Adam Wharton, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Will Hughes remain.",
      "But there is a need for reinforcements and to push on from a position of strength. The central-defensive cupboards are particularly bare and Guehi’s departure feels inevitably whether this summer or next. Sporting must be too busy counting the Viktor Gyokeres pennies to start negotiating over Ousmane Diomande just yet.",
      "",
      "9) Manchester City and a right-back\nPep Guardiola perhaps didn’t realise he had identified his right-back solution for the best part of the next decade when Manchester City spent £50m to sign Kyle Walker in 2017.",
      "The only other players the Spaniard has signed specifically for that position at the Etihad have largely been lapped by that recovery pace: Danilo was only ever a back-up; Yan Couto never played for the club and Issa Kabore might well follow suit; Joao Cancelo was exceptional for a brief time before being ostracised.",
      "Walker described his exit chat with Guardiola as “not very comfortable” but in outlining a desire for new challenges in January, he spared the manager an even less pleasant conversation this summer.",
      "His decline has been pronounced and with the deposed champions embarking on their most ambitious squad revamp since Guardiola’s first, a shiny new right-back feels like The Final Piece of the Puzzle.",
      "",
      "8) Brentford and a forward\nAmong the many ludicrous numbers supporting Spurs’ choice of Thomas Frank as their new manager is this: in summer 2024 Brentford made Ivan Toney their record sale, spent most of the proceeds on Igor Thiago, saw him play 169 minutes last season due to injury and still enjoyed their best goal return in a single top-flight campaign post-Second World War.",
      "Keith Andrews was responsible for many of those as set-piece coach and it could be that his acumen transfers seamlessly to the role of Frank’s replacement as his first senior managerial post.",
      "But the likelihood remains that Brentford will lose either the fourth or sixth highest scorer in the entire 2024/25 Premier League; it would be a surprise if both Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa remained.",
      "Even in the event that attack is kept intact, Brentford need far more up front. Kevin Schade is the only other vaguely proven option in a department which needs Thiago to hit the ground running without knacking his knee.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds and a keeper\nWhen Leeds chairman Paraag Marathe took the unprecedented step of issuing a vote of confidence in a manager who had just earned Premier League promotion, adding that “we are going to build the best squad that we can with every penny that we’re allowed to spend,” supporters might reasonably have expected more than a freebie and £30m worth of defenders.",
      "Unless the plan was for Sean Longstaff to play in net, as a No. 10 and up front, Leeds need considerably more to compete instead of going into the season with a worse squad than that which Sam Allardyce took down two years ago, which is still really weird.",
      "That new keeper is especially pressing after the mistakes of Illan Meslier mounted to the point Karl Darlow had to drag Leeds over the line in the sodding Championship. Just sign Aaron Ramsdale and perpetuate the curse.",
      "",
      "6) Liverpool and a striker\nWith the ludicrous greed of Newcastle extending beyond selfishly keeping Alexander Isak to signing an option on the next rung down of desirable centre-forwards, Liverpool are a handful of steps away from declaring this the season Darwin Nunez finally comes good.",
      "A record of 40 goals and 26 assists in 143 appearances is far from shameful but a team pursuing trophies on four fronts requires far more consistency and reliability than the Uruguayan can offer.",
      "Liverpool could also do with a centre-half or two but ultimately the modern Premier League title race demands for one contender to Need A Proper Striker, and Arsenal are soon to pass on a baton they picked up from Manchester City years ago.",
      "",
      "5) Bournemouth and a centre-half\nAt least Andoni Iraola is aware that Bournemouth “will not find the same player” as Dean Huijsen, although it would be no disaster to identify another defender they are able to sell on for ludicrous profit within a single season.",
      "The sale of the Spain international and Milos Kerkez – and Paris Saint-Germain’s reluctance to meet the asking price – should preclude the exit of Illia Zabarnyi and subsequent extensive rebuild of Bournemouth’s entire central defence.",
      "But Huijsen alone leaves a substantial enough gap for the Cherries to plug, with more capable cover needed too.",
      "",
      "4) Aston Villa and a right-winger\nThe January transfer window gamble did not pay off. It made Champions League qualification a minimum requirement which proved beyond the competence levels of Emi Martinez and Matty Cash to deliver, and only increased the financial strain.",
      "That has been underlined in a deeply uninspiring start to the summer transfer window. Villa probably need to sell before they sign and the £3.5m generated for Kaine Kesler-Hayden doesn’t even cover Yasin Ozcan’s arrival.",
      "They need a right-back. They need at least one centre-half. They need a significant injection of attacking depth, including more options on either side and competition for Ollie Watkins. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were shiny distractions but only ever for so long.",
      "",
      "3) West Ham and a striker\nThe Prophecy dictates that West Ham always need a new striker. From Mido and Benni McCarthy in the first Sullivan and Gold transfer window to Evan Ferguson in the most recent, the East London graveyard of centre-forward hope has been littered with names over the last decade and a half.",
      "It is uncomfortably revealing that their best striker signing in that time was a left-winger plucked from the Championship and eventually repurposed into an unshiftable channel-running nuisance.",
      "Talks are ongoing with Michail Antonio over a contract renewal but Graham Potter needs far more backing, even if Niclas Fullkrug takes a break from his stint as irascible pundit to nod in a few goals.",
      "",
      "2) Everton and a right-winger\nThe signing of Thierno Barry has addressed one problem position but with a first-team squad currently comprising of about 18 players, Dave can afford to dither no more.",
      "Everton are especially light on numbers in defence, midfield and attack, while Jordan Pickford could probably do with some company too.",
      "But the most shocking aspect of Everton’s squad composition is that Jack Harrison was on loan from Leeds all this sodding time. Can Seamus Coleman play a bit further forward?",
      "",
      "1) Manchester United and a striker\nRuben Amorim has already been failed yet again by Manchester United, who by mid-July have only been able to generate money in the summer transfer window through sell-on clauses on players they offloaded long ago.",
      "Some might prefer to ask questions of how Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Fernandez have found themselves at Champions League sides after being deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, but Manchester United having the foresight to ensure they were covered in that event is a necessary sign of growth and sensibility.",
      "Yet it will barely touch the sides of where that budget needs to go, especially if Brentford continue to inconsiderately want their money’s worth for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Even beyond another addition of a high-performing forward operating in the bottom half, Amorim needs someone capable of leading the line. It feels like a role painfully beyond the current capabilities of Rasmus Hojlund and while Joshua Zirkzee has handled the weight of the shirt far better, the Dutchman’s goal return isn’t close to what the position demands.",
      "The dream scenario is still on: Gyokeres struggles for Arsenal while Benjamin Sesko excels at Manchester United."

      "We’re all of course very much enjoying Manchester United predictably failing to find buyers for the host of forwards they’ve told the world they don’t want, but they’re not alone in struggling to shift attacking talent this summer.",
      "Fortunately for United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle and Arsenal, we’ve come up with a neat five-club forward swap deal to suit (almost) all parties…",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea\nHe’s surely the most No Way Back of all five no-way-backers at Manchester United, and we pray that he’s turning up to his prescribed 5pm bomb-squad training at Carrington donning the Aston Villa Marcus Rashford shirt along with the man himself, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Interest from Napoli has gone quiet and Garnacho’s resisted the temptation to join idol Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr as reports suggest he wants to stay in the Premier League amid interest from Aston Villa and Chelsea, who now look in a good state to receive a so-called ‘bad apple’.",
      "Previous links to Garnacho, last summer and again in January, will have prompted Chelsea fans to wonder whether what they really needed was another mercurial forward yet to prove he’s worth the transfer fee, particularly one with a burgeoning rap sheet of off-field misdemeanours. But Champions League qualification, two major-ish trophies and £30m-odd off the asking price later and they probably think he’s worth the punt.",
      "It’s hard to watch Garnacho and not think he could be brilliant, and if he’s not it doesn’t really matter for Chelsea right now, with Enzo Maresca building quite The Arsenal of attacking players for their inevitable title challenge next season.",
      "",
      "Anthony Gordon to Liverpool\nWhile he’s not thought to be pushing for the Newcastle exit, nor them pushing him, we’re guessing Gordon remains open to the idea of returning to his boyhood club given he couldn’t wait to break the news of his imminent move last summer and told all of his England teammates at Euro 2024 he would be leaving St James’ Park for Anfield before the transfer collapsed.",
      "We’re far from convinced he’s what Liverpool need or whether he could make the step up, but Gordon’s got a knack of smearing egg all over our faces for doubting him and with the added danger of Arne Slot apparently wanting him, we wouldn’t dare to suggest it’s anything other than the perfect transfer.",
      "",
      "Luis Diaz to Arsenal\nDiaz may well win the race with Marcus Rashford to sign for and not be registered by Barcelona, while Bayern Munich are also interested, but Arsenal are also very much in the market for a new left winger.",
      "We of course want this to happen on the proviso that Liverpool then sign Rodrgyo as well as Gordon to boil the utmost Gooners p*ss after their extraordinarily entitled reaction to signing Noni Madueke from Chelsea, the downside being Diaz is a wonderful footballer who would almost certainly be brilliant for them.",
      "",
      "Leandro Trossard to Manchester United\nTrossard has now decided he ‘wants to leave’ Arsenal this summer having presumably signed if not started the #NOTOMADUEKE petition, realising that his game time looks set to be significantly reduced as a result of the Chelsea star joining the club, along with Viktor Gyokeres and likely another forward.",
      "The Manchester United chiefs will pitch that a move to Old Trafford is a more attractive prospect to the Belgian than the inevitable Saudi offer, and even a switch to Fenerbahce to play under Jose Mourinho. And although they would be fighting a losing battle with Bayern Munich should the Bundesliga giants push ahead with a move, it’s a transfer that makes a lot of sense for the Red Devils, if a bit of a disheartening one for Trossard.",
      "He feels like a near-perfect player to operate in one of the inverted winger roles in Ruben Amorim’s infamous 3-4-3, and even assuming they finally secure Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, the Portuguese boss will need players to rotate in those positions with Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount.",
      "And signing Trossard would also grant Amorim the attractive prospect of playing three summer signings in a front trio rather than Rasmus Hojlund or one of the other deplorable options already tarred by the Old Trafford brush.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku to Newcastle\nReports suggest success with an ‘official bid’ for Hugo Ekitike would render this entirely moot as Newcastle insist they want an £86m striker to rotate with Alexander Isak rather than replace him, but if we lift the wool from over our eyes we’re comfortable in the belief that Eddie Howe may actually need another forward to rotate with Ekitike. He could sign both and still have change to spare.",
      "Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Liverpool all retain a belief that there’s A Footballer In There despite Nkunku offering remarkably little evidence in his two-year stint at Chelsea, and the Frenchman may well look at Newcastle, with Champions League football and Howe’s standout record of improving players, as an excellent landing spot this summer.",
      "Chelsea have ‘reignited talks’ with the Man Utd outcast, who has ‘rejected’ a big-money move to Saudi Arabia to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Leandro Trossard has indicated to Arsenal that he wants to leave this summer after the club’s transfer flurry in recent days, according to reports.",

      "10) Erling Haaland\n“We cannot replace him, we cannot,” said Pep Guardiola through tears induced by Sergio Aguero’s farewell match, in which the Argentinean inevitably scored twice from the bench.",
      "The Manchester City manager had lied equally absurdly a month or so before, stating that “because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season”.",
      "Haaland arrived in a £200m package soon after and is now within five places of Aguero on the club’s all-time top scorer list after just three seasons. Although it somehow remains unclear whether Manchester City are better without a Proper Striker or not.",

      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",
      "Yet Van Nistelrooy left with just one Premier League title, an FA Cup and a League Cup, matched with the solitary Golden Boot he managed to snatch away from arch-nemesis Thierry Henry.",
      "",
      "8) Freddie Ljungberg\nArsene Wenger felt compelled to make an exception for Ljungberg, a player he had never seen in person before sanctioning his purchase from Halmstad in 1998.",
      "“I saw Freddie Ljungberg giving a hell of a lot of problems to Martin Keown while watching him on television as he played for Sweden against England. I decided to buy him then,” the legendary Arsenal manager once said of a Euro 2000 qualifier in which Keown categorically did not feature.",
      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",
      "",
      "5) Ashley Cole\nBy the time Cole left Chelsea for Roma after winning seven trophies in eight years, the pawn in the controversial move which saw him swap a fading force for one just establishing itself was retiring from the game completely.",
      "Arsenal wanted £25m for their starting left-back at the start of summer 2006; they eventually relented and settled for £5m plus William Gallas.",
      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off. They certainly benefited from a situation of their own making with Cole, whose bridges back to Arsenal had been summarily torched, but still.",

      "4) David de Gea\nIt might not be entirely accurate but it does feel as though De Gea single-handedly prevented Manchester United from enduring as catastrophic a season as their most recent on multiple occasions over a 12-year tenure.",
      "He was the original Bruno Fernandes, a tangibly better player than most if not all his teammates yet bizarrely keen to sacrifice the best years of his career to a failing institution. Once that fax machine faltered in 2015 it seemed as though De Gea just accepted his fate as a Manchester United lifer.",
      "The club never was going to show that same loyalty as soon as the Spaniard became dispensable and their handling of his exit was amateurish. But there was a time – after a rough initiation period – when Manchester United almost accidentally possessed the finest keeper in the world.",
      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",
      "Manchester City collapsed without Rodri in 2024/25 and ongoing negotiations over a substantial pay rise suggest they know precisely how important a role he plays.",
      "",
      "2) Roy Keane\nIt takes a certain type of character to jump from Brian Clough to Alex Ferguson while infuriating Kenny Dalglish in between, but as Keane himself would say, he was just doing his job as the most sought-after midfielder of a generation.",
      "If Blackburn had filed their paperwork properly and Dalglish not taken a sunny July weekend off in 1993, the first Premier League crown under Ferguson might have been marked by no Manchester United incomings whatsoever. But it opened the door to a record-breaking hijack which shaped the club’s future and heralded a glittering and often contemptuous spell.",
      "Keane won a dozen trophies and two Player of the Year awards at Old Trafford, committing to history one of the most iconic individual performances the sport has seen, inspiring the introduction of the prawn sandwich brigade to the game’s lexicon and forlornly challenging the ego of Rio Ferdinand.",

      "1) Cristiano Ronaldo\nArsene Wenger basically refused to do business with Jorge Mendes again over a perceived betrayal. Liverpool management duo Gerard Houllier and Phil Thompson “almost choked on our food” when the £4m deal they had put in place was obliterated by the announcement of a £12.2m hijack by a bitter rival.",
      "They had finished second and fifth respectively to champions Manchester United, who swooped in late but decisively for the next big thing.",
      "Ronaldo was likely destined for greatness wherever he landed but only a fool could claim his biggest development period would have been better served elsewhere. Ferguson and Old Trafford was the perfect post for the Portuguese to learn; within six stunning years he became the sport’s best and most expensive player.",

      "They’ve tried twice before to sign the 23-year-old, who got 22 goals and 12 assists in all competitions last season, but failed to land him in January 2022 when he opted for PSG, and again last summer when he joined Frankfurt for just £14.3m.",
      "The report claimed the Bundesliga side will likely hold out for the striker’s €100m [£86m] release clause, but that Newcastle had nevertheless ‘made the player’s representatives aware of their desire to sign the France Under-21 international and hope to agree a fee’, perhaps having been prompted into action by Frankfurt signing striker Jonathan Burkardt from Mainz for £18m.",

      "Boulma tweeted: ‘Newcastle and Manchester United remain the most active clubs in the Hugo Ekitike deal. Chelsea, who have shown interest since last winter, continue to monitor the situation closely. Liverpool are taking a back seat, following the player, but not making him a priority.

      "Napoli showed interest in the 21-year-old at the start of the window but those links have since gone quiet and The Telegraph’s Mike McGrath revealed on Monday that he’s ‘rejected’ the chance to ‘pursue a move to Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia’.",

      "The report reads: ‘At this point, the situation is tightening. Kean never accepted Al-Qadsiah’s offer, nor did he comment on Al-Hilal’s interest, which had contacted his entourage in recent days. Manchester United’s prospect should not be underestimated, as the Red Devils could make a move for the 2000-born player during the final hours of his release clause.’",

      "“There’s not a lot the manager can do about that, he can only set the team up for success, and then the players must go out and perform to get positive results.",
      "“At times last season, I think the pressure got to the players. They were playing a new formation and losing games, so the pressure was mounting on them all the time.",
      "“The expectation of playing for Man United can weigh heavily at times, and the players found that out last season. It is up to the manager in those moments to recognise it and pump the players full of confidence, but if they are losing games, that is hard to do.",
      "“However, they have all that experience now. They can use last season’s tough times to get them through next season’s tough times, so I do expect them to improve next year as a team. However, if the mistakes are still happening regularly, teams will punish you in the Premier League and results will be hard to come by.”",

      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",

      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable.",

      "",
      "18) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",

Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "10=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",

      "",
      "7=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five. And for some reason the bookies agree that he is nowhere near safe.",
      "",
      "7=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "3) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford if they sell Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "1) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "",
      "Arsenal supporters have lost it over the £50m+ signing of Noni Madueke, but here are six times Mikel Arteta has made angry fans look foolish.",

      "It’s money month, the time of year when the season sort of starts again with friendlies and fake tournaments, but not really. It’s also a despicable time when the ugliness of top-flight football arrogantly bestrides the world in pursuit of tiny amounts of extra money.",
      "If your side does well, it cheers you for the new campaign; a few poor results and everyone is disgruntled. And it usually proves no guide to what happens in the season.",
      "ITV even showed Preston v Liverpool. It still seemed more significant than the CWC obviously, but I seriously wonder about the fitness of footballers who last played internationals a month ago. We’re familiar with player burn-out as a concept, though it’s usually only used as an excuse for defeat, not a reason for victory. You’ve been playing for the best part of 11 months; you’re not going to lose anything in a month that a friendly against Preston would revive. Surely light training is all that’s needed.",
      "Back in the day, the time off would last from mid-May until mid-August, a time which would be spent drinking and eating gravy dinners, so players would need to run up sand dunes – vomiting as Big Jack shouted profanities – to get fit again, but I doubt that’s the case now that they measure everything all the time and they live off chicken and pasta.",
      "I watched Middlesbrough play and lose to Port Clarence Reserves in the 70s, but clubs have now realised there’s money in pre-season games and pretending they’re competitive. So this Saturday you could watch Gateshead v Sunderland or Matlock v Derby or Dartford v Charlton amongst others. I’m not sure anyone except the most loyal obsessive bothered, but it’s a part of a great tradition. And of course bigger clubs are playing in fake tournaments all across the world so they can earn enough to pay for a reserve full-back from Austria.",
      "But then Premier League clubs are different, moral-free beasts with no conscience. The Guardian reckons the 20 clubs are unconscionably taking a planet-breaking 175,000 summer air miles in just a few weeks, the idiots. Manchester United are flying 24,000 miles to show off their mediocrity and are even playing Leeds in Stockholm. City are spending 15,000 miles in the air and face Palermo in Sicily to contest the inaugural Anglo Palermitan Trophy which commemorates the Sicilian club’s maiden fixture against a team of British sailors in 1900. At least they’re used to wasting energy competing in insignificant tournaments. You’re playing for fans in the country you’re flying to, are you? As they die in the heat or are swept away in floods, I’m sure they’ll appreciate it..",
      "Time was they’d play a relatively near lower-league side to help them earn much-needed money from the gate receipts for games that were much in demand. Games like the one v Preston are rare. You can see Liverpool play Milan in Hong Kong though. Or Newcastle play Arsenal in Singapore. No game against Blyth Spartans in Blyth, then? Nah, that’s just legacy thinking.",
      "Personally I loved the pre-season friendly. Boro went through a phase of playing Hibs thanks to Tony Mowbray’s connections and they were always great pish-ups that Hibs certainly took seriously.",
      "There is a better solution, though it would deny these clubs money to fritter away. Scottish football, which I know most of you don’t care about, and to be fair does have the tradition of terrible decisions by the SFA, got it right for once and has had a much better idea with the Premier Sports Cup. The group stage involves 40 clubs – the 37 SPFL clubs for 2025/26 who are not involved in European competition plus Bonnyrigg Rose (relegated to Lowland League), Brora Rangers (Highland League winners) and Brechin City (Highland League runners-up).",
      "Teams are drawn into eight groups of five based on final league positions in 2024/25 and it fires the starting gun on the new season this weekend. They realised that the League Cup retains some credibility so they set up a league stage, where they get to play actual competitive games instead of friendlies and football-starved fans lap it up in the ‘foreign’ July heat, heading towards a final in December.",
      "It is often the one trophy that the Glasgow big two don’t actually always win, though Celtic are the current holders and it has value because of that alone. The CWC has shown the pointlessness of playing in tournaments no one believes in.",
      "Why doesn’t England swallow its ego and copy Scotland instead of treating it like a poor, pish-stinking old relation? It’d get the competition done earlier, providing an early meaningful start to the season. They’re obviously not opposed to playing in July. However, the gate receipts are probably dwarfed by money gained playing in these fake overseas tournaments. So once again, we see how local, domestic football suffers because of the insatiable lust for money, no matter how small, in a way it once never was.",
      "Pre-season pulls back the curtain and shows the most important thing to top clubs. It’s not football or even fitness. It’s just money. Nothing else. The hateful club execs, desperate to justify their lavish wages, just care about money. 175,000 miles. Climate change doesn’t discriminate in favour of football clubs, y’now. You die too. Good luck paying to offset that. And more to the point, you’re effectively killing and ruining the lives of your own fans. Yeah, that makes good economic, if not moral, sense.",
      "Even that doesn’t stop the stupids or deniers. More money, more money, more money. Stop buying players! We’d rather see a local kid come through. No? They’re all crap? Well, that’s down to you. But you’d rather fry in 33 degrees of heat to get one place higher in the league? Morons. It’s 27 degrees here on the west coast of Scotland, it’s unnatural. And when you get skin cancer you can thank the Premier League for not giving a shit and putting a few quid above the health of the planet and its people. F*cking idiots.",
      "So craven for a little bit more money, they are even prepared to exploit not just the Earth but their own assets to the maximum and then some, even at the risk of breaking those same assets, the way they’re breaking the planet. To a rational mind it makes zero sense and is the economics of the madhouse. Protest this obscene situation because they are willingly blind to it. On the contrary, they think they’re clever.",
      "Further down the pyramid, it’s still as it ever was as your local centre-half takes a break from laying bricks to kick your fancy striker up in the air, but it’d be nice if it actually mattered and since they’re already playing, why not? Keep pre-season local.",
      "Does the environment not matter? Obviously not. What a terrible example to future generations who will have to live with and combat their selfishness, if they live at all.",

      "United kick off their US tour with a game against West Ham in New Jersey on July 26.",
      "There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want - believed to be £65m - however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.",
      "United are also still working on outgoings and, despite being given extra time to find a solution on his future, Marcus Rashford has returned to the club's training ground at Carrington.",
      "The striker is training away from the first team and using the club's medical and rehab facilities.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",
