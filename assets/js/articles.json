      "Manchester United's plan to win the Premier League title by 2028 has been ridiculed by former striker Teddy Sheringham – who branded it “pie in the sky”.",
      "Sheringham also claimed United boss Ruben Amorim will be sacked if he makes a poor start to the new campaign, after ending last season in 15th place – their lowest-ever Premier League finish. Despite that shambolic season, United chief executive Omar Berrada has doubled down on his belief they will lift the Premier League trophy by 2028.",
      "Berrada launched Project 150, the aim of which is for United to win a 21st league title by 2028, the year the club celebrates its 150th anniversary. But after 18 league defeats last season and the failure to secure European football for only the second time in 35 years, Sheringham accused Berrada of living in dreamland with his title claim.",
      "“Omar Berrada’s comments are dreamlike,” said Sheringham. “In football clubs, you’ve got to have small steps to get to places. If you see those small steps and are encouraged and moving in the right direction, that’s when you start looking positively at the future.",
      "“But when people come out with quotes like that, it can be pie in the sky when you’ve got to give the manager time to get things right. For United, the results must improve. It can’t go on like this. The way the talk is – 'it’s alright, we’re gearing for next year, everything is ok for next season'.",
      "“But I think they’re a long way off being anything like the United of old and the pressure will be on Amorim, without a doubt. If he starts the season like the end of last season, there's only one way things will go.”",
      "Sheringham, who scored in United's dramatic 2-1 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999, to clinch the Treble, also said every player should be up for sale – apart from skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“Any player that’s underachieving at United would be surplus to requirements,” said Sheringham. \"And there’s not a lot of players at United who are playing at the top of their form, other than Fernandes.",
      "“So I would think that any offers that come in for anyone playing for United would be very welcome, to be able to get players out and to get others in. Sometimes players fall off a cliff, but I can’t see him [Fernandes] doing that, he’s still got the appetite to go out and do better and lead by example.",
      "“But if Fergie had an offer of £100million for one of his 31-year-old players, going on 32, for the business end of the football club, you’d have to think about things like that.”",
      "Sheringham also said he has sympathy for United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who managed just 10 goals last season, claiming the service provided by his team-mates is simply not good enough.",
      "“We’ve been speaking about Højilund for a good couple of years now,” said Sheringham. “First and foremost, I still think he’s a decent striker, I just think he’s been starved of service at United.",
      "“The way they play, they play with two out and out wingers, no real support apart from Fernandes getting forward. It’s all about the service for centre-forwards and he’s had none. I struggle to think about any striker that you could put in there, that would suffer from the same service and still score goals.",
      "\"You’d have to be some player like Didier Drogba, who did things on his own at times, to score goals. Being a young man as Høljund is and coming into a new country and into the Premier League, trying to understand it, I think he’s had a tough ride.”",

      "Everton should target a summer move for Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund according to their former player Pat Nevin. Hojlund has endured two difficult seasons since joining the Red Devils in a £72million deal from Atalanta.",
      "The 22-year-old scored 10 goals in 52 appearances last term as United struggled to find the net and 16 goals in 43 outings during his debut season in 2023/24. Ruben Amorim is looking to strengthen his forward line this summer having already added Matheus Cunha from Wolves, and the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen linked to transfers.",
      "Nevin, who played 150 games for the Toffees and scored 21 goals, reckons David Moyes would be able to prise the Denmark international away from Old Trafford on loan. And he believes the Everton boss will find a player well-suited to his style.",
      "Moyes will find himself short a striker as Dominic Calvert-Lewin's contract runs out at the end of June. And Nevin reckons the perfect solution is out there.",
      "Speaking to Spin Genie, the ex-Scotland international has urged Moyes to make a move. \"There are some good names out there,\" said Nevin.",
      "\"The loan market is something Everton have looked at in the past and I think it's something they should revisit again. It gives them all sorts of possibilities as they're not spending £50 million.",
      "\"There are two or three players that they could think about bringing in from Manchester United but Rasmus Hojlund is the one that sticks out. If you look at his style of play, it’s a perfect match with how David Moyes likes to play. While his numbers haven't been great this season, Moyes loves hard workers and that's something you can never complain about in regards to Hojlund.",
      "\"It's not very often David Moyes has had a 20-30 goals-per-season striker. He’s had strikers who run in behind and create space to bring others into play, so, if he's available, Hojlund could be a tempting option for Everton to sign on loan.\"",
      "Everton have already missed out on Liam Delap this summer, after the striker joined Chelsea. Moyes has admitted that the Toffees will need to find greater success to enjoy an easier time in the transfer market.",
      "“Players, if they have the chance, want to play in the Champions League. I’ve just come out of a club ( West Ham United) where three out of four years we played in Europe and what a difference it makes when you’re a club in Europe because the players are attracted, whatever European competition that is, is attractive to a lot of players and makes a big difference,\" he said.",
      "“We’re not at that at the moment so I don’t know if I can compare us selling Wayne [Rooney] but we were always a club that didn’t have a huge amount of money. We had to generate some money ourselves.",
      "“But then, the club had £500million to spend and in that period and I don’t think it was as good as when we spent carefully and were a little bit wiser.\"",

      "The 2-2 draw on Monday was a tense affair as three players were dismissed in total, with Jorge Figal joining Herrera in receiving an early bath, while Andrea Belotti was sent off for Benfica.",
      "Herrera was given his marching orders just before half-time after attempting to barge his way through to speak to the referee while he was in the middle of a VAR review.",
      "The former Spain international had to be held back by security officials and referee Cesar Arturo Ramos reached for his back pocket and issued the red card after being informed of the player's conduct.",
      "Herrera had already been substituted at the time after hobbling off in the 20th minute due to an injury.",
      "The Argentine club confirmed that Herrera and Figal - who was sent off in the 88th minute for a foul on Florentino Luis - have both been banned for four games, pouring doubt on whether they will appear in the competition again.",
      "However, Boca Juniors said they would appeal against the length of the bans, with Ole reporting that the club have questioned why Belotti was only given a two-match ban for a high boot on Ayrton Costa.",

      "In the end, the allure of trophies is what swayed Harry Kane to Bayern Munich in the summer of 2023. Throughout his time at Tottenham, Kane was renowned as one the continent's top strikers and was on the radar of every top European club.",
      "In 2021, Kane did everything he could to try and force a move to Manchester City, including publicly stating his desire to leave Spurs during a round of golf with Gary Neville. However, he waited two more years before Bayern forked out £100m to bring him to Bavaria from North London.",
      "While Bayern won the race, Manchester United had been working on a move for the England captain for some time. When Erik ten Hag first took up the reins at United, it was exclusively revealed by the Mirror that he wanted Kane to be one of his first transfer signings. However, it was not the right time for Kane, as he was determined to become Spurs' record goalscorer.",
      "Moreover, if the England skipper was to leave, it would have been for a club that was immediately ready to challenge for the big trophies and not one that was building or in transition.",
      "After overtaking Sir Jimmy Greaves' Spurs tally the following February, United thought they had the perfect opportunity to sign Kane. Spurs finished outside the top four, during a campaign which saw Antonio Conte be sacked by the club, while United had just won the League Cup, reached the FA Cup final and finished third.",
      "Kane had also publicly said that he wanted to overtake Alan Shearer's record of scoring 260 Premier League goals, seemingly ruling out a move abroad. With City enjoying Erling Haaland's services and Liverpool signing Cody Gakpo at the time, a move to United appeared to be the only realistic Premier League move.",
      "It was a more promising situation than 12 months before when Kane was reluctant to move to Old Trafford after United's struggles under Ole Gunnar-Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. The Red Devils finished sixth with their worst points tally for 32 years and had also endured their fifth consecutive campaign without a trophy.",
      "Kane's motivation to leave Tottenham was driven by his desire to win a major trophy. At the time, the North Londoners were seemingly in a better position to win a title than United.",
      "The England frontman had decided that he would only leave Tottenham for a side that's ready to compete for big trophies immediately and not one that was in transition. Kane was impressive in his final campaign at Spurs, but their 8th placed finish meant the writing was on the wall in regard to his future.",
      "Initially, it was reported that Kane's representatives had a \"secret meeting\" with Paris Saint-Germain, who were interested in a move. PSG transfer chief Luis Campos held an \"informal conversation\" over Kane's future, according to Foot Mercato.",
      "At the time, PSG were embarking on a fresh approach to transfers and were in the process of moving Lionel Messi and Neymar on, so they could build a younger and fresher team. A move to the French capital did not suffice and with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy being reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival, Bayern Munich were in the right place at the right time.",
      "When the rumours about a move to Germany were ongoing, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy urged Kane to move to Bayern and plunder as many goals and trophies as possible. In his column for Daily Mail, Murphy said: \"If Bayern Munich come calling this summer, he should go. It would be hugely sad if a player of his quality finished [his career] without winning a trophy. It's something he himself would regret after retirement.\"",
      "He added: \"Going abroad might cost him Alan Shearer's Premier League goals record but, in the grand scheme of things, that shouldn't put him off. In five years, we could be talking about Harry Kane, Champions League winner with multiple Bundesliga titles and cup medals.",
      "\"I'm sure Kane will get other offers. Manchester United have been mentioned, but he hasn't got time to be part of a team that is building. If he was going to leave, it would be primarily to win trophies from the get-go, which would make Bayern his best option.\"",
      "Kane would go on to snub any other interest from United to secure his £100m move to Bayern. After a disappointing first season saw Bayern fail to win a trophy for the first time in a decade, Kane won the Bundesliga under Vincent Kompany, helping himself to 38 goals and 13 assists in 47 matches along the way.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Osimhen only has a year left on his deal in Naples which will put his club under pressure to sell as the summer goes on. He has previously been linked with a move to Chelsea, but that never materialised last summer.",

It has already begun following Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival from Wolves, while Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike and Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo remain high on the wishlist.",

      "However, the club are hoping to offload expensive stars such as Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho from their wage bill to continue saving as much money as possible and reinvest it into their team. Earlier this year, Ratcliffe revealed United would have gone bust by Christmas without their new cost-cutting regime.",
      "\"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of 2025,\" he said in an interview with Gary Neville. \"Where do you want to spend the money? Do you want to spend it on operating the club or do you want to spend it on the squad? Because if you spend it on the squad, you get better results.",

      "Ferdinand's claims come amid suggestions fellow target Viktor Gyokeres would favour a move to a club in the Champions League. Gyokeres starred under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting CP, where he still plays his club football, but a reunion might not be entirely straightforward.",
      "Gyokeres was also high on Arsenal's shopping list, with the Gunners deciding between him and Benjamin Sesko. Now, according to reports in Germany, Mikel Arteta's side have reached an agreement with Sesko - though they are yet to meet RB Leipzig's valuation of the Slovenian.",

      "Osimhen, who scored 37 goals in 41 Galatasaray games last season, has also been of interest to Saudi club Al Hilal. The 26-year-old is believed to favour a move to a European club, though, and Ferdinand has made his position clear.",
      "\"No.9, they already know who I want,\" Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents when discussing United's options. \"The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen!",

      "Despite several blunders last season against the likes of Lyon, Leicester and Brighton, he remained the club's first-choice keeper. However, his position is one that Amorim may look to strengthen this summer.",

      "That would mean he'd have to join his international team-mates late, mirroring the controversy from two years ago when he missed the opening match of the 2023 tournament due to a late arrival at the national camp.",

      "And the England manager is not the only one to think along those lines. Several times, Enzo Maresca and Pep Guardiola have voiced their major concerns over the physical and mental demands being made on their players.",
      "It might only be the slightest of consolations but perhaps the Premier League fixture schedulers have shown some sympathy for Guardiola and Maresca. Working on the basis that the three promoted teams are ranked 18th, 19th and 20th, the average finishing position from last season of City’s first six opponents next season is 13th (12.8, to be precise).",
      "That figure is 12th (11.67) for Chelsea. Just as significantly, Chelsea do not have to leave London until over a month into the campaign, a home starter against Crystal Palace being followed by a trip to West Ham before a derby with Fulham at Stamford Bridge is followed by a short hop to Brentford.",

      "Now, Portuguese outlet A Bola say that Gyokeres has become frustrated with a lack of transfer movement, but has set out which clubs he would like to join this window. They are Mikel Arteta's Gunners and Juventus, who have supposedly tabled a mammoth £11-million-a-year wage offer.",
      "According to the report, five clubs have expressed an interest in signing Gyokeres, with the Swedish striker currently enjoying a well-earned holiday.",
      "In England, both United and Arsenal have long been documented to hold the goalscorer in high regard, and Atletico Madrid, Juve and Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli are among the other noted suitors.",
      "However, Gyokeres has supposedly prioritised moving to either the Emirates or Turin, and to rub further salt into the Red Devils' wounds, it is claimed he would also welcome any approach made by rivals City and Liverpool.",
      "It is said that the £70million-rated Swedish star would also prefer moves to the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG or Bayern Munich, and he remains 'upset' that he has not yet been allowed to make a switch.",
      "While Gyokeres has seemingly made it crystal clear that a move to north London would be his ideal Premier League transfer, the Gunners also have their eye on another striker.",
      "Reports from German outlet BILD suggest that RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is close to joining Arsenal this window, and personal terms have been agreed between both parties. With the Bundesliga club failing to qualify for European football this term, a fee in the region of £70m-£85m could seal the deal.",
      "Gyokeres may then turn his attention to his other priority, Juventus, who Corriere dello Sport reports have offered him a lucrative £11m per year to leave for Serie A.",
      "With it seeming increasingly likely that Gyokeres will not join United, Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike has emerged as another name who could be brought in to bolster United's firepower.",
      "As first reported by The Times, Amorim's side are interested in making a move for the Frenchman, and a £60m price tag has been slapped on the star who scored 22 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "\"I'm glad we have him [Ekitike]. If he decides otherwise, that's our motto: If a player develops faster than us, we let him go,\" admitted Frankfurt chief Markus Kroshce ahead of what promises to be an incident-packed transfer window.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "A supercomputer has tipped Liverpool to retain their Premier League title ahead of Manchester City and Arsenal after the fixtures for the new season were released. The schedules for all 20 top-flight clubs were announced on Wednesday morning.",
      "The Reds stormed to their first title since 2020 last season in what was boss Arne Slot's first campaign as manager after replacing Jurgen Klopp. Arsenal finished as the runners-up for the third successive year, while City's hopes of defending their crown for a fifth successive year ended in tatters.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the surprise package of the year, securing qualification to the Europa Conference League. Down at the other end of the table, relegated Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have been replaced by Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "Anticipation for the new season will only be growing as the summer goes on, with the summer transfer window in full swing. Liverpool have been working hard to give Slot the best chance of leading a successful title defence.",
      "They have already signed Jeremie Frimpong, with Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez on their way into Anfield. And it appears that those moves may well pay off for the Reds.",
      "According to a supercomputer from BettingLounge.co.uk, Liverpool will finish top of the league for a second successive year. The supercomputer is a probability model, not determined by human predictions or bias.",
      "It instead estimates the outcome of each remaining fixture based on a team’s current strength (based on factors such as league position and form) and betting market odds. The machine then simulates the remaining games in a season 10,000 times and constructs an average league table from the 10,000 simulations, to rule out anomalous results.",
      "Slot's side have been backed to lose just four games and win 24 matches to claim the title. Their closest challengers are tipped to be City, who are predicted to finish three points behind the Reds.",
      "Arsenal are expected to drop down to third, with the supercomputer tipped them to end up a mammoth 10 points adrift of the champions. Having missed out on the Champions League last season, Aston Villa are predicted to return to Europe's premier competition by finishing fourth.",
      "Newcastle are tipped to round out the top five as they continue to impress under Eddie Howe. Those two will be on the rise at Chelsea's expense, with the Blues set to drop to sixth under Enzo Maresca.",
      "While they have lost boss Thomas Frank, Brentford will not feel his absence, with the Bees tipped to end up seventh. Brighton and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace will take up the two places just behind the Londoners.",
      "And Bournemouth are predicted to round out the top half, despite losing a raft of players in this summer's window. With European football to deal with, Nottingham Forest are set to suffer and drop down to 11th in the table.",

Arteta will certainly be hoping that his side can come out of those six fixtures unscathed as he attempts to finally end the club’s long wait for the title.",
      "But it’s actually United who statistically have the hardest run, according to Opta. They host the Gunners on the opening day before clashes with Fulham and Burnley.",

      "But some Arsenal fans aren’t too convinced, with some even claiming that a title challenge could be over before it’s even begun. One fan said: “Starting the season with Man U, Leeds, Liverpool, Forest and City is really crazy..”",

      "Having responded to a season that ended on a minus goal difference with four defensive signings last year, Manchester United are redressing the balance this summer after their goal difference became ten times worse.",
      "Matheus Cunha lived up to his number '10' with Wolves last season, tallying 15 Premier League goals. Bryan Mbeumo got five more for Brentford and United are in the market for a new No.9.",
      "Well-placed figures at United spoke about three or four signings before the end of last season. Three of those would go straight into the first team.",
      "A new frontman, Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad and Bruno Fernandes in the same starting XI is an imposing attack. Ruben Amorim will have Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and probably Joshua Zirkzee to call upon as well.",
      "Beyond the three intended attacking additions, the starting XI may otherwise be untouched. United absolutely need an athletic midfielder but they have to get Manuel Ugarte, a considerable investment at £50.75million, up to speed after a patchy first season.",
      "A new signing's maiden campaign can always be couched as one of adaptation. Ugarte was not Erik ten Hag's pick to shore up a porous midfield and United's style under the Dutchman was no different before his eventual defenestration in October.",
      "Ugarte was entrusted by Ruud van Nistelrooy, a fellow fluent Spanish speaker, during his caretaker stint and he started in 28 of his former Sporting coach Amorim's 42 matches in the dugout. Yet Ugarte ended the season behind Casemiro, regarded as a busted flush, in the pecking order and was benched for the Europa League final.",
      "Casemiro's fine form was reserved solely for Europe and he could be redundant in a season comprising only domestic football. Provisionally, Amorim has to reinstall Ugarte with Fernandes as his probable partner in midfield.",
      "Ugarte and Fernandes have started in a midfield two 11 times and United were beaten on only four occasions. Two of those defeats came three days after Europa League knockout ties, a period when United were half-hearted in their weekend fixtures.",
      "Whether United are able to shift Casemiro or not, they require a major reinforcement in the middle third. Mainoo's positioning is largely irrelevant as the alternative is Toby Collyer, whose three starts for the club have come against teams from Scotland, Romania and League One.",
      "United are about to release two over-the-hill centre backs but they do not need another one. United recruited Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven within seven months, Harry Maguire has had his contract extended while Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw could be permanently relocated to centre half.",
      "\"I've enjoyed it,\" Heaven said of his first four months at United. \"It's been tough, the team has really helped me to play my best and I just want to keep going next season.",
      "\"I always try my hardest when I play to impress people and I think I've been doing that. I just want to continue.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez, recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, should return well before the end of the calendar year. The 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson made a decent transition to the first team, albeit in relatively sedate circumstances (and two defeats).",
      "Talking about a lighter workload in relation to Shaw suggests a punchline is imminent. In all seriousness, with a reduced schedule Shaw could possibly hack it as a left winger if he improves his conditioning. United took a relative punt on Patrick Dorgu and it seems inevitable that the left wing will be a position to strengthen next year when Shaw has a year left on his contract (unless a club has taken him off United's hands by then).",
      "Shaw, 30 next month, started five games last season and all of them were at centre back. United lost four and, privately, Amorim must rue picking him in the Europa League final when his form and fitness did not merit that privilege.",
      "United cannot rely on Shaw, who has played in 27 out of 112 matches in the past two seasons. Harry Amass is a sprightlier left winger though there is significant risk in having a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old vying for such a demanding role with Mbeumo pencilled in on the other flank.",
      "Dorgu's first four months were mixed and one assist was a derisory return. It would not have helped that whenever he had the ball and looked up he saw either Rasmus Hojlund or Zirkzee. Dorgu will not be cut any more slack this time next year.",
      "Staff at United speak positively about the Dane's athleticism and his Serie A pedigree. \"It's been tough, challenging,\" Dorgu admitted. \"But I'm happy I played a lot.",
      "\"I think the manager trusts me and I try to help the team, so just happy to be on the pitch and I try to do my best over here.",
      "\"It's a bit different from my old team but I was playing attacking there as well. I just need to adapt to the players and how everyone moves on the pitch.",
      "\"It's obviously different because the fanbase is so massive. A lot of people talk! Everyone is talking about United. It is difficult for young players but I think if you have the right mentality I think everyone can cope with it and it's about performing on the pitch.\"",
      "Do that and United may be back in the pluses."

Sancho does not have a squad number, Antony is not an option for printing on the club's online store and Rashford is expected to have his number 10 revoked and reassigned to Matheus Cunha. Amorim told Garnacho he can go.",

      "Young United fans have idolised Rashford and many still do. He was not as domineering a presence as Paul Pogba during the club's player-power period or indulged as much as Anthony Martial, which made his transgressions under Amorim and Erik ten Hag - after the latter had restored authority to the United manager's role - so disappointing.",
      "After Sir Alex Ferguson did a U-turn and delayed his retirement in 2002, a United player turned to Dwight Yorke, in exile but optimistic ahead of the apparently impending managerial change. \"That's you f*****d, Yorkie.\" Yorke laughed. Rashford knows there is no route back at United with Amorim in charge.",
      "Ten Hag stood up to Cristiano Ronaldo, so Sancho was always going to be small-fry after he publicly accused the Dutchman of lying. Hardly any teammates sympathised with Sancho and urged him to reoncile with Ten Hag. He never did.",
      "Amorim looked bemused when he was incongruously asked in February whether Sancho could have a future at United. \"Jadon Sancho is not my problem.\" He is now.",
      "United need £14.58m to avoid a loss on Sancho under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. It was amusing, for a while, that Chelsea had agreed an obligation to pay up to £25m for Sancho until someone at Stamford Bridge reached for a calculator.",
      "Antony, La Liga-worthy and back in the Brazil squad, has a higher resale value than Sancho but only a handful of clubs would be in the market for the winger and have the financial wherewithal to hit the magic £32.52m mark. Antony has created a market for himself but United may have to tolerate another season-long loan, burnished by a loan fee and an obligation or option to buy.",
      "Of the four forwards in the departures' lounge, Garnacho is the most regrettable. He could not see the wood for the trees in the days leading up to the Europa League final, despite the giveaway that he would be benched when he was named as a substitute five days beforehand at Chelsea. That marked the first time he had been benched for successive games since January.",
      "Garnacho came on at 0-0, defended fecklessly for Marc Cucurella's winner, was rollocked by Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire and still got his hair bleached on the eve of the final. He very deliberately remained on the San Mames pitch, chewing the fat with Sergio Reguilon, as the United team was announced with all of his teammates were in the dressing room.",
      "Most United punters would have started Garnacho against Tottenham. That he didn't does not excuse his post-match petulance. Speaking in his native tongue, he cast doubt on his future.",
      "It felt telling that in the United corporate section for the semi-final at Athletic Bilbao, the only players whose agents were visibly present were Garnacho's and Kobbie Mainoo's. Garnacho's representatives, Enrique de Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro, appear to have been largely useless in advising their client on his social media etiquette. They made everyone aware they were at Chelsea in January when the club considered bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho all but confirmed his bench berth hours before the Europa League final with a passive aggressive post of his FA Cup final goal. He was at it again when United touched down in Manchester after the tempestuous post-season tour. Garnacho uploaded a picture of the Manchester Airport tarmac with the word \"Finally\", accompanied by crying-with-laughter and praying emojis. Whenever he grows up, it will be away from United.",
      "De Lucas and Cambeiro have allowed Garnacho's sense of entitlement to inflate. He and other puerile teammates had to be told to stop raising their middle fingers for photographs in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Garnacho left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium with sunglasses on at gone 11.30pm at night. He blanked everyone as he strolled through the mixed zone and he looked downright miserable when ordered to fulfil meet-and-greet duties post-match in Hong Kong.",

      "Rashford's working relationship with Solskjaer was not as rosy towards the end and he was particularly dismayed by the handling of his shoulder injury towards the end of the 2020-21 season. Solskjaer also sensed a shift in Rashford's demeanour amid a nationwide love-in over his free school meals campaign.",
      "United could not have foresawn Rashford's form nosediving after a career-best season but there were red flags. An antagonistic story the day after he was benched for the Manchester derby in March 2022, his brother's public dalliance with Paris Saint-Germain and a significant change to his entourage.",

      "After Omar Berrada declared Manchester United would go in search of versatile players this summer, it is easy to understand why Bryan Mbeumo currently sits top of their wish list.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves earlier this month, United have earmarked Brentford star Mbeumo as their next target to go after in this summer's window.",
      "Despite seeing an opening offer worth £55million knocked back a fortnight ago, United are understood to still be in talks with Brentford over a deal. Furthermore, Mbeumo is just as keen to get a deal over the line.",
      "It is thought Brentford are holding out for a fee similar to the one United paid Wolves to sign Cunha (£62.5m), although he was attainable via a release clause. That made the deal relatively straightforward to get done.",
      "Despite interest from Tottenham Hotspur, who recently appointed former Brentford chief Thomas Frank as their new boss, Mbeumo has told confidants that he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer. It is players of his character and mentality United need.",
      "Mbeumo enjoyed a stellar 2024/25 campaign, scoring 20 Premier League goals, meaning his stock is at an all-time high. He would boost United's chances of increasing their attacking output and would offer a sense of the versatility Berrada believes United need.",
      "Mbeumo, if signed, would be able to operate as a right wing-back, a right-sided No.10 and potentially as a striker. He would tick plenty of boxes.",
      "But with United keen to move at speed this summer, in terms of securing incomings and overseeing outgoings, they may have to keep other options in mind if talks over Mbeumo do not progress as quickly as they would like them to.",
      "According to a report by The Guardian, United have expressed interest in West Ham United ace Mohammed Kudus. It is claimed United, Chelsea, Newcastle United and another unnamed Premier League club are keen on his signature.",
      "It has been widely reported in recent weeks the Ghanaian wants to leave West Ham this summer and open a new chapter. Despite links with a move to Saudi Arabia, he is not keen on a move to that part of the world at this stage in his career.",
      "Kudus has an £85m release clause in his Hammers contact that will reportedly become active for Premier League clubs for the first ten days of July. However, the Hammers are keen to cut their cloth this summer and raise funds via player sales, meaning they may be prepared to negotiate a lower selling price.",
      "A £65m fee has been mooted and that would represent a more realistic valuation of the 24-year-old, who was on United's radar back in 2022 when at Ajax. Despite not scoring 20 goals like Mbeumo did in 2024/25, Kudus has a lot of similar characteristics.",
      "Just like the Brentford ace, he is extremely versatile and likes to drift into central positions when tasked with starting out wide. He has pace, power and the ability to make something happen in the blink of an eye.",
      "Although his second season in England was nowhere near as fruitful as his first, which produced 14 goals and nine assists, he is still a player of great quality. Admitting he prefers to play as a No.10, he would be a tailor-made fit for Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Mbeumo ought to remain United's priority target in their search for a right-sided option, but Kudus should be considered as an alternative option if a deal for the former cannot be reached. However, the Reds are unlikely to entertain Kudus' £85m release clause."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Thursday, June 19.",
      "The summer transfer window is in full swing and United supporters are waiting for their club to make their second major signing of pre-season. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is the closest player to joining the Reds with MEN Sport reporting this week that United remain confident about his impending arrival.",
      "A centre-forward will still be needed in the summer and United have been linked to plenty of options. Legendary centre-back Rio Ferdinand has demanded that his old club target Victor Osimhen and he is one of the names linked with Old Trafford.",
      "Meanwhile, reports in Germany have suggested this week that United have entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike. However, there is plenty of interest in his services from Premier League clubs including Liverpool and Chelsea.",
      "Another position that could be strengthened is the goalkeeper. Andre Onana is not expected to leave Old Trafford this summer but that has not stopped links to Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez.",
      "With this in mind, keep across all the latest United transfer news and updates below:",
      "Marcus Rashford will reportedly snub a move to Newcastle United as he holds out for a move to Barcelona this summer.",
      "Tha Daily Star report that the Man United man is ready to turn down a move to St James' Park, despite the club being able to offer Champions League football. Any deal with Newcastle is reported to have to be a loan deal.",
      "The report adds that Rashford is also ready to tell United that he does not want to travel to America with the squad in pre-season should he not have secured a move away by then.",
      "According to Football Insider, the Reds are expecting a bidding war to commence for Alejandro Garnacho this summer.",
      "It is believed that bidding for the Argentine shall begin at £50m and likely rise from there.",
      "Napoli, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur are all expected to show some level of interest in his services.",
      "Hello United fans, Good afternoon.",
      "It's Amie here again and I'll be here for the next few hours, bringing you the latest news from in and around Old Trafford, including the latest on Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Emiliano Martinez.",
      "As always, we'll start with a look at some of the things from so far today that you may have missed:",
      "Man United 'stance' on Viktor Gyokeres alternative amid Jadon Sancho transfer problem",
      "Man United can finally sanction a transfer they should have done three years ago",
      "Manchester United have been given the green light to sign £85m Bryan Mbeumo alternative",
      "Marcus Rashford shares clear Paul Pogba feelings as ex-Man United star shows true colours",
      "After the report surrounding Gyokeres and his supposed decision to join Arsenal over United, it may now be time for the Reds to turn their focus back towards Osimhen.",
      "The saga surrounding Gyokeres feels eerily similar to the disaster that unfolded with De Jong in Ten Hag's summer so maybe now is the time to pivot their attention.",
      "It feels like Osimhen has been almost forgotten this summer so maybe United have the chance to swoop in ahead of their rivals.",
      "According to The Athletic, Barcelona have reached personal terms with Athletic Club's Nico Williams and do not see his £50m release clause as a barrier towards getting the deal done.",
      "That news is a hammer blow for Rashford who has been dreaming of a move to Camp Nou as his time at United looks to be at an end.",
      "With Williams on the way to signing, it now looks increasingly unlikely that the La Liga club will move for Rashford as well or, at the very least, he will not be seen as a priority.",
      "According to talkSPORT's Alex Crook, Gyokeres has told family and friends that he is expecting to join Arsenal in the transfer window.",
      "It is claimed that while he has a pre-existing relationship with Amorim, the desire to play in the Champions League is edging him towards north London.",
      "Sporting are thought to be wanting nearer to £80m to allow Gyokeres to leave this summer and the Lisbon club are reportedly ready to play hardball with clubs to make sure they get that.",
      "The Guardian understands that the Reds are keeping an eye on West Ham forward Mohammed Kudus this summer.",
      "Kudus arrived at the Hammers in August 2023 and after a good debut campaign endured a difficult second season in East London.",
      "West Ham have inserted a release clause of £85m in Kudus' contract which is perhaps more than United or any of their Premier League rivals would be willing to pay.",
      "While Newcastle have reportedly thrown their hats into the ring for Rashford, it appears the winger is not yet willing to give up on his dream of signing for Barcelona.",
      "According to Marca, Rashford is willing to present himself as the cheaper option to Barca than their other targets Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "In doing so, Rashford is reportedly willing to do things within his control to push through a move to Camp Nou this summer.",
      "The Sun understands that Newcastle have joined the race to sign Marcus Rashford this summer from United.",
      "It is thought Eddie Howe's side are confident they can provide the right platform for Rashford to rebuild his career.",
      "Their offer of Champions League football could also entice him but a move to Barcelona has been at the top of Rashford's wishlist for some time now.",
      "Former Manchester City and Villa centre-back Joleon Lescott believes that the West Midlands club will be able to find a replacement for Emi Martinez should he choose to sign for United this summer.",
      "Speaking to Betway, Lescott explained:",
      "I don’t want to sound disrespectful, but I think they can replace him. I think they have a strong enough team and style, and I think Unai Emery’s proven that. They haven’t missed any player, really, they’ve been able to rotate, add, take away, suffer injuries. Martinez is top, very, very good, but I think if they acquire someone with experience, I think that’s key – the experience of who comes in to play that position, because they’re still relatively young at the back. That experience can add an amount of calm. I think it’s a loss, 100 per cent, but I don’t think it derails them where there’s question marks asked about whether they can achieve similar things to this season.",
      "A new twist in the Emi Martinez saga unfolded last night when it was reported by GiveMeSport that the Aston Villa goalkeeper had offered his services to United this summer.",
      "It is thought that Villa would be reluctant to see the Argentine leave their club but are wary of potentially breaching profit and sustainability rules if they do not sell him.",
      "United would need to pay approximately £40m to sign the ex-Arsenal shot stopper.",
      "One minute they were in for him, the next they are out - now there are claims that the Saudi club are back in the race for Osimhen.",
      "This transfer window hokey cokey can be very confusing but, at the moment, reputable sources understand that Osimhen does not favour a move to the Middle East.",
      "When sent the previous lucrative offer from Al Hilal prior to the Club World Cup, it's believed the striker rejected it because he still holds a desire to play in Europe.",
      "Despite this clear setback towards United's hopes of signing Osimhen, Ferdinand is still pushing to bring the Nigerian to Old Trafford.",
      "On his namesake podcast this week, Ferdinand renewed his calls to bring in the striker",
      "No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen! It looks like he’s turned down Al-Hilal… he must be waiting for Manchester United. I don’t know if Manchester United are going to come. That’s the problem.",
      "Malaysian media outlet Sabah understands that Osimhen is not currently interested in moving to either United or Arsenal this summer but has kept the door open for Chelsea.",
      "It is claimed that Galatasaray and Al Hilal are still frontrunners for his signature having both offered him lucrative salaries.",
      "The Istanbul club are reportedly willing to pay him £12.8m per year with £8.5m available in add-ons while the Saudi Pro League club are believed to be willing to spend £42.6m on his annual salary.",
      "While these offers blow United and Arsenal out of the water, it is believed the Nigerian has remained in talks with Chelsea regarding a potential deal.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and hopefully you managed to get some sleep in the UK as we truly settle into this heatwave.",
      "If you didn't, don't worry as we have plenty of United news to come today to keep you feeling awake and reinvigorated on this Thursday morning.",
      "To kick things off, we shall begin by looking at the latest surrounding this man...",
      "That is everything from us tonight, thank you for joining us.",

      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta has said that the club are workin on a signing amid links to United's Marcus Rashford.",
      "The forward is expected to complete a move away from Old Trafford in the summer transfer window, having spent the second half of the season just gone on loan with Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona are one of the teams linked with a move for Rashford.",
      "Speaking at a meeting with club members on Wednesday, Laporta said:",
      "\"We have brought in one player [Joan García] and we're working on another really exciting signing.\"",
      "He added: \"A lot of obstacles have been put in our way, but we have managed to overcome them,\" Laporta added.",
      "\"We can sign players normally without LaLiga intervening. It's a moment of real satisfaction because a lot of work has gone in to the club's economic recovery.\"",
      "United have been in talks with Real Betis over a move for Antony, according to reports in Spain.",
      "ABC De Sevilla claim that Betis officials travelled to England last week to try and sort a deal out.",
      "It is reported that they proposed a deal that would see them pay £17 million and become part owners. It's a regular occurance in the Spanish league, but not in the Premier League.",
      "It is said to be Betis' only way that they can fufil their hopes of making the winger's loan move permanent this summer.",
      "Fellow journalist Ben Jacobs has backed up the comments from Fabrizio Romano on Mbeumo.",
      "He reports that United remain optimistic over the transfer, despite Thomas Frank's appointment at Spurs.",

      "Man United academy graduate Ethan Wheatley has outlined his ambitions to break into the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "The striker started off a crazy comeback for England U19s against Germany on Tuesday night in the 5-5 draw, with the Young Lions 5-1 down in the second half.",
      "The 19-year-old spent the second half of the 2024/25 season on loan with Walsall, but struggled for game time. However, he is not thinking about his short term future.",
      "\"I’m just more concentrated on this tournament,\" he told PA Sport. “But, yeah, since [Ruben Amorim came in, I was away with international camp and, obviously, went on loan in January, so I’ve not really been around it too much.",
      "\"But I want to be a Man United player in the future. If that doesn’t happen, then it obviously wasn’t meant to be. We’ll just see what happens in the future.\"",
      "He added: \"Even if my first [loan move] didn’t go well - and it didn’t - I had it in the back of my head,\" he added. \"And I was telling staff around the club, it’s not going to define me as a player.",
      "\"It’s not going to judge where I end up in the future. I think it’s just like a little blip in my early career and, hopefully, I can just bounce back from it going into next season.\"",
      "18-year-old Diego Leon will join up with Manchester United next month, with the club completing a deal to sign him from Cerro Porteno.",
      "V Sports Team report that he will travel to Manchester on July 1, with his contract at Old Trafford running until 2030.",

      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano has given the latest update on the future of United target Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The forward has emerged as a key target for United in this window, but has also been linked with a move to Spurs, where he would link up with former manager Thomas Frank.",
      "Speaking to GIVEMESPORT, Romano provided the latest:",
      "\"My understanding is that Manchester United remain, at the moment, in control of the situation, in conversation with Brentford, the club-to-club talking almost on daily basis, trying to find a solution.",
      "\"We know with these clubs like Brentford, Brighton is always difficult to negotiate for their top players, so it's not easy to reach an agreement, but United are on that. They are talking to the club, always in contact with player agents, and with an agreement with Bryan Mbeumo, because the player wants to go to United.",
      "\"And so at the moment, United remain frontrunners on this story. Let's see if they can be able to reach an agreement on the fee with Brentford.\"",
      "Hello United fans, it's handover time.",
      "My name is Amie and I will be taking you through the rest of the evening. As ever, we will be bringing you all of the latest United transfer news, rumours and opinion.",

      "TEAMtalk understands that Arne Slot is prepared to allow Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa to move to Serie A to bring the Nigerian to the club.",
      "Continuing on his podcast, Ferdinand has insisted that Gyokeres alternative Osimhen is waiting for the Reds to move to the front of the queue before choosing his next destination.",
      "It is reported that the Nigerian has already rejected a move to Al Hilal and while Galatasaray are working hard for his signature, no agreement has been struck yet.",
      "No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen! It looks like he’s turned down Al Hilal… he must be waiting for Man United. I don’t know if Man United are going to come. That’s the problem.",
      "Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the ex-United centre-back expressed his pleasure at the business that has been done and a deal that is expected to be done shortly.",
      "I’m happy with Cunha, he’s one of the ones I mentioned on my list. I hope it goes well for him. The problem is that I’ve been happy many times in transfer windows and it’s gone wrong. I’m hoping he’s not going to be added to that list. If they get Mbeumo, I’d be very happy because he wants to come. Mbeumo wants to come, I know it. His stats over the last three seasons in the Premier League are up there, by the way. Goals and assists, goal chances, ridiculous.",
      "According to Record, Gyokeres' camp has turned down the opportunity to enter talks with Sporting to clear the air.",
      "After much confusion surrounding the amount Sporting are willing to let Gyokeres leave for, it is believed the Swede was left furious about a perceived back track from the Lisbon club's perspective.",
      "In an attempt to clear the air, the Portuguese giants attempted to reach out to the striker but this has been rejected leading to further speculation that Gyokeres is trying to push through an exit.",
      "TEAMtalk understands Rashford's desire move to Barcelona this summer is in jeopardy, as things stand.",
      "It is claimed that Barca are unsure about United's £40m valuation for the Englishman and instead are looking at Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams as their top priority.",

      "West Ham United star Mohammed Kudus has admitted he is at his best when operating as a No.10 amid reports linking him with a move to Manchester United.",
      "According to a report by The Guardian, Kudus is attracting interest from a crop of Premier League clubs, including United, Chelsea and Newcastle United.",
      "The Ghanaian international is said to be open to leaving the London Stadium this summer, but he has no interest in moving to Saudi Arabia, meaning there is a very high probability he could stay in Europe and potentially in the Premier League.",
      "United have ambitions of adding to their attack this summer and they are currently determined to sign Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo. They completed the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha for £62.5million earlier this month after triggering his release clause.",
      "Kudus also has a release clause in his contract that is worth £85m. It is reported it will be valid to Premier League clubs for the first ten days of July.",
      "Amid West Ham's desire to freshen up their squad this summer, they need to raise funds via player sales, meaning Kudus' valuation may be up for negotiating, meaning any interested party may be able to drive down the price and pay less than the value of his release clause.",
      "He joined West Ham from Ajax in August 2023 for £38m and enjoyed an outstanding debut season in England, scoring 14 goals and registering nine assists. He often flexed vis versatility in his first season at the London Stadium, playing through the middle and out wide, but with a tendency to drift inside.",
      "\"Recently, I've played on the wings or even as a striker sometimes but I've always been a midfielder.\"",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's appointment as head coach last November, United immediately transitioned to a 3-4-2-1 formation, meaning the centre-forward is supported by two attacking-midfielders. Cunha has been recruited for the left-sided No.10 spot and Mbeumo is being targeted to play in the right-sided role.",
      "Kudus, though, would be a suitable alternative to Mbeumo if a deal for the latter fails to materialise. United saw an opening offer worth £55m for the Brentford ace turned down earlier this month.",
      "Kudus' second season in England was nowhere near as fruitful as his first, with his 35 appearances yielding just five goals and four assists. However, at the age of 24, there is still plenty of time for him to work on his consistency.",
      "The attacker, who was on United's radar back in 2022, is also extremely versatile, capable of playing on the left, the right or through the middle. He would tick a lot of boxes if the price could be driven down."

      "The Frenchman has been without a club since December after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract with Juventus. In March, Pogba's 18-month suspension after testing positive for a banned substance was lifted.",
      "But while he is now available to play professionally again, he has yet to be snapped up. Pogba has been spending plenty of time in Miami recently, including watching Sir David Beckham's Inter Miami in the MLS, leading to speculation that he could be joining them, while French side Monaco have reportedly offered him a two-year deal.",
      "Pogba remains in the Florida city this summer and took to Instagram to share photos from a recent training session conducted in the US. During that session, Pogba was seen wearing a Boca Juniors shirt accompanied with the caption: \"Stay ready,\" perhaps hinting that he has yet to find a suitor for his services.",
      "While Boca could be a destination for Pogba, he is likely to only be wearing the jersey, imprinted with Marcos Rojo's name and number, because he reunited with the centre-back and other former United teammates, Sergio Romero, Edinson Cavani and Ander Herrera at the Club World Cup this week. The quartet all currently represent the Argentine giants and were in Miami this week for their opening clash of the FIFA tournament against Benfica.",
      "Among those to comment on Pogba's latest Instagram post was Rashford who sent a clear verdict on the Frenchman. \"Playerrrrr,\" the forward wrote accompanied by a fire emoji.",
      "Rashford and Pogba were also teammates at Old Trafford and, like the Frenchman, the winger is expected to be departing United this summer.

      "After joining Manchester United from Chelsea for an initial fee of £55million in July 2023, Mason Mount wasted no time in declaring his best position.",
      "\"I've always seen myself as a midfielder or a No.8 that can obviously get forward, attack, try and score goals and create goals,\" he told MUTV.",
      "\"But I am also able to do the other side as well and defend and help the team when we're under pressure.\"",
      "United signed Mount to add energy to their midfield and become a long-term replacement for Christian Eriksen in the No.8 position. The Dane excelled in his debut season at Old Trafford in 2022/23 but it was clear United needed younger legs in that area of the team.",
      "Operating in a 4-3-3 formation under former manager Erik ten Hag at the time, Mount was expected to join forces with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in United's first-choice midfield. Casemiro had enjoyed an outstanding first season at the club after arriving from Real Madrid in August 2022 and was, at the time, one of the very first names on the teamsheet.",
      "However, Mount's first season in M16 was ravaged by injuries, restricting him to just 20 appearances in all competitions. He played just 14 times in the Premier League, making five starts.",
      "As a result, it was impossible to make a firm judgement on if he would be the ideal long-term replacement for Eriksen. It was hoped the 2024/25 campaign would be much kinder to him on the injury front.",
      "However, the fact he only managed to make 26 appearances in the most recent campaign meant that wish failed to become a reality. A serious hamstring issue sidelined him between mid-December and the beginning of April.",
      "Despite his unavailability, he regularly earned praise from United head coach Ruben Amorim, who declared his admiration for the England international after replacing Ten Hag last November.",
      "He said: \"Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid. You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.",
      "\"I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he's trying to stay fit and we hope he can continue to be fit, to show all the talent that he's shown, for example, in Chelsea.\"",
      "Well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation from his time at Stamford Bridge, there was always a chance Mount could flourish under Amorim, and there was evidence of that towards the end of the campaign.",
      "In Amorim's system, Mount is deployed as one of the two No.10s and not as a No.8. He is a perfect fit the former Sporting Lisbon boss, although he was originally signed to play as a No.8, albeit in a 4-3-3.",
      "Having already added Matheus Cunha to their ranks this summer and attempting to sign Bryan Mbeumo, United could start the new season with a plethora of options to occupy either of the playmaker spots. Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad are all capable of playing as a No.10.",
      "If signed, Mbeumo could be a shoo-in to occupy the right-sided No.10 spot amid the expectation Cunha will command the alternative No.10 spot, meaning Mount may not be a guaranteed starter.",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim values him enormously and he is a good option to be able to bring off the bench. He fits the system perfectly and Mount will be hungry to make up for lost time."

      "Manchester United's new match categorisation ticket model has been branded a \"kick in the teeth\" by supporters.",
      "United will list six Premier League home fixtures as category A games, with prices between £59 and £97. The six teams are Liverpool, Manchester City, Leeds, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle.",
      "Eleven league fixtures have been tagged category B, priced between £57 and £86, two are in the C band (£37-£60) while domestic cup fixtures are the D category (£32-£52). Junior and senior concessions remain in place and the categorisation only applies to match-by-match ticket members and not season ticket holders.",
      "United sources say the new structure reflects the reality of large variations in demand and attractiveness between different fixtures and that they have prioritised their most loyal fans in season-ticket holders and under-16 matchgoers.",
      "The Manchester United Supporters' Trust claims the fans' forum and the fans' advisory board (FAB) were not properly consulted on the new structure and that the price of the cheapest ticket for most league games has risen by more than 50 per cent. United sources say the figures were presented to the FAB, who requested a review.",
      "The new measure comes after United supporters fumed at least season's mid-season ticket-price hike to £66. Several supporters also demonstrated against the club's decision to relocate their season tickets in favour of a new hospitality section in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Old Trafford.",
      "United endured their worst season in 51 years in 2024-25, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, who had last lifted silverware in 2008.",
      "A source said the categorisation introduction has kept season-ticket prices lower than what United had initially proposed.",
      "MUST said in a statement: “After how last season went, we might have hoped the club would reconsider their plans for this new ticketing model which will see eye-watering price increases for 20,000 supporters per game who buy tickets on a match-by-match basis. This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans.",
      "\"When the club said they were introducing this new model for members' tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower demand games.",
      "\"Once again, they have failed to consult any of the fans representative bodies on the details of the decision, and once again they’re making choices against the interests of fans and, we believe, the club as a whole.",
      "“The club's stated commitment to fan representation is fine in principle, but once again is not being delivered in practice. The structure is in place, and the fans' forum and FAB representatives are doing their job, but the club are not adhering to their previous commitment to proper consultation and that needs to change and change fast.",
      "“What Manchester United needs next season is a united fanbase and club, with the team on the pitch supported by loyal and vocal fans roaring it back after the disaster that was last year.",
      "\"These ticketing decisions only push those regular supporters away in favour of occasional visitors and risk pricing out the next generation of younger fans who are the very future of the club.",
      "\"This match categorisation model will do enormous harm and undermine the atmosphere in the ground in a season when the team will need it more than ever.”"

      "Gomes is expected to complete a transfer to the Ligue 1 runners up in the coming weeks after his contract with Lille expires.",
      "The 24-year-old changed agencies earlier this year and Gomes had his heart set on a move to Barcelona after five years with Lille. If that was not to materialise, Gomes was confident of moving to a top-half Premier League side.",
      "Instead, Gomes is set to remain in France and head south to Marseille, who qualified for the Champions League under former Brighton coach Roberto de Zerbi.",
      "Gomes will reunite with former United teammate Mason Greenwood at the 1993 European Cup winners. Greenwood ended last season as the joint-top scorer in Ligue 1 with Paris Saint-Germain talisman Ousmane Dembele on 21 goals.",
      "England international Gomes received his maiden call-up to the national team squad during Lee Carsley's interim tenure in charge in September and was named in all three of his squads. Carsley coached Gomes at under 21 level but the midfielder was excluded from Thomas Tuchel's first two squads in March and June.",
      "Gomes left United on a free in 2020 after he rejected their offer of a new contract. Gomes made his debut aged 16 years and 263 days under Jose Mourinho in May 2017 but went on to make only nine more appearances for his boyhood club.",
      "Former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took a dim view of Gomes's contract wranglings in 2020 and omitted him from the matchday squad against LASK Linz in the Europa League. Gomes was the only outfield player who travelled to Austria and was omitted from the matchday squad and he spent his final five months out of the first-team fold amid uncertainty over his future.",
      "Gomes became the fourth-youngest United player at the age of 16 years and 263 days against Crystal Palace in May 2017. He has made one start in the last seven months and his representatives failed with a desperate attempt to secure a loan move to a Premier League club on deadline day in January 2020."

      "However, on the opening weekend, no match will be anticipated more than the clash between United and Arsenal at Old Trafford. It will be an interesting test to see whether or not Ruben Amorim's newly rebuilt squad can challenge with a side who are desperate to go one step better next season and win the Premier League.",

      "Andre Onana is not expected to depart Old Trafford this summer and there is a strong chance that he will be in goal as first-choice by the time the Premier League returns. However, the arrival of Martinez from Aston Villa would give the Cameroonian some much-needed incentive to become more consistent.",
      "It would be some Premier League debut for Martinez too, considering his ties to Arsenal and the manner in which he left the Emirates Stadium.",

      "Wing-backs - Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu",
      "This is potentially the most difficult position on the pitch to choose heading into next season. Noussair Mazraoui and Amad will feel hard done by for missing out but before a pre-season ball has been kicked, you would feel that Dalot and Dorgu are the options Amorim will go for.",
      "Central midfielders - Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes",
      "Due to the potential new signings, we can expect Fernandes to take up a deeper No.8 role next season rather than featuring as a No.10. The captain was the only reliable cog for Amorim this season gone, and you would expect him to fit seamlessly alongside either Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte.",
      "We have chosen the Brazilian as his performances at the end of this season were perhaps more consistent. But that selection alongside Fernandes is up for grabs.",
      "Attacking midfielders - Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Spoiler alert, the remaining players in this dream XI are all fresh additions. Cunha is already in the squad and having signed so early, you would expect him to slot straight into the team.",
      "Mbeumo remains a transfer that United are confident in making and between the two of them, they bring 37 goals from this season into the side which is desperately needed.",
      "Striker - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "He's the man that Amorim wants to lead the line more than anyone else next season. Gyokeres looks destined to leave Sporting and Arsenal's interest in him is on shaky ground right now.",
      "You would feel that if it is not going to be the Swede, it will be a new signing of some description leading the line. Rasmus Hojlund's future looks in doubt while Joshua Zirkzee's career at United looks better suited to a No.10 role."

      "The two sides did not meet in the league until December last season, meaning the fact they will meet just four games into the new campaign is rather interesting. United won at the Etihad last term, coming from being to seal a very late 2-1 win.",

      "United concluded their 2023/24 campaign against the Seagulls at the Amex, winning 2-0 via goals from Diogo Dalot and Rasmus Hojlund. It meant they went into the following weekend's FA Cup final with a spring in their step.",

      "Manchester United have been handed a revival in their hope of signing Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres this summer, with a major update regarding Arsenal's transfer plans.",
      "United are searching for a new striker to spearhead Ruben Amorim's attack after their worst goalscoring season in 35 years. Gyokeres has been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford since Amorim moved to Manchester last year.",
      "Gyokeres and Amorim spent 15 months together with the Sweden international scoring 66 goals in that period. It was expected that the 27-year-old would be allowed to leave below his €100million (£84m) release clause but a fall-out with Sporting CP has stopped that.",
      "Arsenal have also been linked with signing Gyokeres, with Mikel Arteta under pressure to deliver a title to the Emirates Stadium. Reports last week indicated that the striker's preference was a move to the Gunners, leaving United in limbo, but news coming out of Germany could open the door for Amorim to get his man.",
      "BILD have reported that Arsenal have 'reached an agreement' with RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old has been the Gunners' top target this summer on the back of scoring 21 goals last season.",
      "The report in Germany claims that the Gunners have come to an agreement with the Slovenian on personal terms. There is still work to be done with Leipzig but it's suggested that the north Londoners have signalled to the Bundesliga side that their offer won't fall short of their expectations.",
      "A bid in between £68.5m-£85.5m is understood to be the fee Arsenal are considering putting on the table, with the exact amount expected to come out in the coming days.",
      "Signing Sesko would see Arsenal drop out of the race for Gyokeres and leave United to construct a deal. Juventus are also said to be considering a move, with reports in Italy suggesting the Old Lady are prepping an €80m (£68m) move for the striker."

      "Viktor Gyokeres is reportedly favouring a move to Arsenal or Juventus this summer, even over long-time admirers Manchester United, and the Swedish striker would even prefer to join Manchester City or Liverpool.",
      "Gyokeres has established himself as one of Europe's top strikers, scoring an impressive 97 goals in just 102 games for Portuguese club Sporting CP, contributing significantly to their two league titles.",
      "When head coach Ruben Amorim left Sporting to take charge at Old Trafford last November, there were suggestions that Gyokeres might follow him, given United's struggling forward line.",
      "Despite the Red Devils' persistent pursuit of the 27-year-old this summer, reports earlier this month indicated that Gyokeres had rejected the idea of a reunion in Manchester.",
      "Portuguese publication A Bola now say that Gyokeres is growing frustrated with the lack of progress on his transfer, but has identified the clubs he would like to join during this window. These include Mikel Arteta's Arsenal and Juventus, who have allegedly put forward a substantial £11-million-a-year wage offer.",
      "The report suggests that five clubs have shown interest in signing Gyokeres, who is currently enjoying a well-deserved holiday.",
      "In England, both United and Arsenal have long been known to admire the prolific striker, while Atletico Madrid, Juventus and Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli are among the other potential suitors.",
      "However, it appears that Gyokeres has set his sights on a move to either Arsenal or Juventus, adding insult to injury for United by also expressing an openness to approaches from their rivals, City and Liverpool.",
      "The Swedish star, valued at £70million, is reportedly more inclined towards transfers to top-tier clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG or Bayern Munich, and is said to be 'upset' that he hasn't been permitted to make a move yet.",
      "While Gyokeres has seemingly made it abundantly clear that a transfer to Arsenal would be his preferred Premier League destination, the Gunners look on the verge of securing the services of another marksman.",
      "German publication BILD reports that RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is close to joining the Gunners, with personal terms already agreed upon. Given Leipzig's failure to qualify for European football this season, a fee in the region of £85m could clinch the deal.",
      "The Swede might then shift his focus to his other preferred club, Juventus, who, according to Corriere dello Sport, have proposed a lucrative £11m per year deal to lure him to Serie A.",
      "With Gyokeres' move to United looking increasingly unlikely, Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike has emerged as another potential recruit to boost United's attacking options.",
      "As initially reported by The Times, Amorim's side are considering a bid for the Frenchman, who has been given a £60m price tag after scoring 22 goals across all competitions last season.",
      "\"I'm glad we have him [Ekitike]. If he decides otherwise, that's our motto: If a player develops faster than us, we let him go,\" Frankfurt chief Markus Kroshce stated, ahead of a transfer window that is expected to be filled with drama."

      "“I don’t know if Manchester United are going to come. That’s the problem.”",

      "The report claims Tudor is ‘otpimistic’ about Randal Kolo Muani prolonging his stay after a successful six-month loan from PSG, but he wants another striker, with general manager Damien Comolli ‘continuing to move on several tables’.",
      "The report states:",

      "‘The 75 million clause applies only to foreign countries and expires in mid-July. Juventus is there and playing its cards but at the same time it is aware that it is not running alone: from PSG to Al Hilal, from Galatasaray to the Premier League.’",

      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",

      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",

      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",

      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off.

      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",

And we really want to know why, because a 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal is really quite embarrassing for Real Madrid. And we know that he did something close to the square root of f*** all in that 1-1 draw.",

      "The Sun then note that he ‘looked defensively solid’. Which is true if you ignore all the times he failed to track his winger, the time he was outjumped at a corner, the times players drifted past him (he did not make one tackle) and the time he appeared to entirely forget he was a defender.

Internally, there are already voices that consider that selling Raphinha for that amount would be a perfect move and that it would happen at the right time, even if Flick continues to be inflexible’",
      "That report comes as transfer expert Fabrizio Romano confirmed the Catalans have reached an agreement with Nico Williams for the winger to join the club this summer in a huge blow for Arsenal.",
      "He wrote in X: ‘Nico Williams and Barça have agreed personal terms on 6 year deal! Agreement sealed on player’s contract until June 2031 with the salary in the region of €7/8m net per season. Barça are currently working on financial terms to get deal done with Athletic.’",
      "While it’s not yet clear how long Barcelona will look to spread out the payments for Williams, the Spain international’s release clause stands at €58m [£49.5m], which is cash they don’t have on hand but would do if they accept United’s mammoth and genuinely unbelievable ‘offer’ for Raphinha.",

Which actually makes sense. We know Napoli like Nunez, who would either be a huge hit or a massive flop in Naples – there’s no middle ground. That could still happen, but more likely now as a stand-alone deal.",

We’re told Napoli have £45million to spend on a winger, but they have a couple of better options in Manchester. More specifically, they have a better option in the United cast-off bin. And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli. And reports suggest he has no intention of lowering his demands. Another loan beckons.",

But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",

Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez.

      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",

      "A transfer insider has suggested that the impending signing of Bryan Mbeumo at Manchester United means there’s a “limited” chance their top scorer keeps his role, but he feels he’ll be “immense” elsewhere.",
      "United have already moved to rectify their forward issues this summer. Last season, during their 15th-placed Premier League campaign, they scored 44 goals in 38 games.",
      "They have signed Matheus Cunha to add some firepower, and Bryan Mbeumo could follow, after 20 goals for Brentford last season.",
      "There’s a battle ongoing between United and Tottenham for the forward, but it’s believed Mbeumo wants to join the Red Devils, while a recent report suggested Spurs had ‘cooled’ their interest as they saw the deal to beat the rival side as ‘impossible’.",
      "That signing, and other United decisions, while push Amad Diallo out of his role, according to insider Graeme Bailey.",
      "He told TBRFootball: “Amad probably knows he’s heading towards playing the right wing-back role.",
      "“If you recall, in [Ruben] Amorim’s first game in charge against Ipswich Town, that’s where Amad played. When he says right wing-back role, a wing-back role in a Ruben Amorim system is not the wing-back role that we usually associate with English football.",
      "“I think the Cunha and Mbeumo signings, and [Joshua] Zirkzee still being there, tell us that the chances of Amad playing as an attacking midfielder are quite limited next season.",
      "“We might see Amad play in that right-side role, that’s what [the transfer moves] are telling us. We know Amad is prepared to play there, he’s done it a number of times for Amorim, and let’s not forget the players who played that position for Amorim – [Geovany] Quenda at Sporting and look how good he is. He’s not a dissimilar type of player.",
      "“It tells us that, while he likely won’t play an attacking-midfield role at United, Amad is still very much in Amorim’s thinking. It’s a position, if they do it right, he’ll become an immense threat in, that [right wing-back] role.”",
      "Diallo was United’s joint-top scorer in the Premier League last season, with eight goals alongside eight assists, and a nunber of those came from the attack.",
      "However, he also showed he was capable of starring in the wing-back position. Amad scored a hat-trick against Southampton in a game he started as a wing-back, and there were more goals and assists in other games he played there, too.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the striker he “wants” the Red Devils to sign is “waiting” for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are among the three clubs in the race to sign Nottingham Forest standout Callum Hudson-Odoi.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have edged closer to making their next signing as Tottenham Hotspur have ‘cooled’ their interest.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur are ‘growing in confidence’ as they look to sign a Premier League winger also linked with Manchester United.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is a player in demand and Tottenham Hotspur’s appointment of Thomas Frank might have affected Manchester United’s hopes of making him their next big summer signing."

      "Manchester United have been handed a boost in their bid to sign a replacement for Andre Onana as a £40m star has ‘offered himself’ to the Red Devils in a ‘major twist’.",
      "It was claimed back in April that Onana had been ‘sentenced’ to the Old Trafford exit, with Nice’s Marcin Bułka and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez among a whole host of goalkeepers linked with a move to replace the Cameroonian.",
      "But transfer expert Ben Jacobs told GIVEMESPORT last week that the United bosses hadn’t yet decided whether to source a new stopper or retain Onana as first choice.",
      "The report stated:",
      "‘Onana went on holiday focused on Manchester United as he has not been warned that he is for sale or at risk of losing his regular starting berth, GMS sources understand, but influential figures are assessing the market and will communicate their decision to him after the initial plan was to bring in a replacement for Altay Bayindir ahead of his expected exit.’",
      "A report on Monday then claimed that they have made their minds up, or rather Amorim has made the decision for them – Onana will remain United’s No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Portuguese boss has ‘conveyed to the board his intention to count on him as a key piece in his project’ and ‘does not contemplate any other alternative’.",
      "It’s claimed Amorim ‘trusts’ Onana and still sees him as the ‘ideal profile’ to build from the back thanks to his ‘technical conditions and ability to play with his feet’.",
      "He insists that Onana can ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure and a well-defined idea of the game’, but the United boss may have his head turned now that Villa’s Martinez ‘has offered himself’ to the club.",
      "GIVEMESPORT claim the World Cup winner wants to join the Red Devils and that Villa ‘have refused to rule out reluctantly granting his wish due to fears of breaching the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules’.",
      "Martinez looked as though he was waving goodbye to the Villa fans after victory over Tottenham last month in their final home game of the season and ‘in a major twist, Martinez has made it clear that he is willing to join Manchester United if they make an approach’.",
      "The report claims Villa want £40m for the 32-year-old as they use AC Milan’s £25m valuation of Mike Maignan amid interest from Chelsea in the France international, ‘complicating matters for Manchester United and Martinez’, though it’s thought Villa do need to sanction big sales amid their PSR concerns.",
      "Maignan has just a year left to run on his deal while Martinez is under contract at Villa park until 2029.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘GMS sources have been informed that Manchester United have still not made a final call on whether to sign a new first-choice option between the sticks or if Andre Onana is surplus to requirements, while Atletico Madrid has been pinpointed as another possible destination for Martinez if Jan Oblak leaves.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their ‘preferred’ replacement for Andre Onana and all parties are open to the transfer.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘initiated talks’ to sign an elite goalkeeper target, after an ‘agreement’ killed the chances of a Barcelona deal.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly looking to bring in a new goalkeeper over the summer with the Red Devils turning their attention to a Poland international."

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "19) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "20) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",

      "“Until now, our sources had not heard too much on Garnacho other than tentative interest. However, we have been hearing more and more noise on this one throughout this week, and fresh info has also just come in on him.",
      "“SPTC sources have heard that Chelsea have been discussing signing Garnacho on a loan to buy deal, just as they did with Jadon Sancho. Of course, both players are Manchester United players, so it would not be a deal that would be unfamiliar to either club and could suit both if the fee is right. I’m not sure if it would be a permanent buy with an option to send him back with a fee, or a straight loan with an option/obligation.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United would sanction Marcus Rashford’s move to FC Barcelona, but they want a player in return.",
      "Rashford‘s future is up in the air after he returned to form during his loan spell at Aston Villa.",
      "The Man Utd forward had limited options in January due to his poor form and huge salary, but Villa took a punt on the England international after selling Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr.",
      "This paid off as Rashford grabbed four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Aston Villa, who are among the clubs interested in signing him permanently this summer.",
      "However, Rashford’s improved form and Aston Villa’s failure to qualify for the Champions League could impact their hopes of signing the Man Utd outcast this summer.",

      "READ: Arsenal and Man Utd ‘nightmare start’ as Premier League fixture day delivers again",
      "Barcelona already have Lamine Yamal and Raphinha to choose from, but it has been widely reported that their priority is to sign a new winger as cover, with Rashford, Luis Diaz and Nico Williams among their targets.",
      "In recent days, it’s emerged that they have stepped up their interest in Williams, but a new report in Spain claims this saga is far from over.",
      "While Diaz’s proposed move to Barcelona is ‘ruled out’ due to Liverpool’s refusal to reduce their asking price, Williams’ switch is ‘complicated’ as they need him to ‘take a pay cut’ and push for Athletic Bilbao to accept a ‘split payment’ deal.",
      "This means Rashford remains an option as his ‘exit is inevitable’ and he is the ‘most financially accessible’ option.",
      "However, Man Utd have ‘asked’ for ‘something significant in return’, with centre-back Ronald Araujo ’emerging as an unexpected’ option.",
      "The report claims Barcelona could be open to this deal, but doubts are surrounding Araujo’s interest in Man Utd.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Araujo’s case is complex. Although he recently renewed his contract, he has lost prominence this season. Therefore, Barcelona would not object to his departure if it allows them to strengthen a priority position like the left wing. The €65 million release clause he signed in his renewal is geared toward that end.",
      "‘However, Araújo’s own intentions are an obstacle. The Uruguayan doesn’t want to leave for a team that doesn’t guarantee him a starting spot from day one, especially if that club doesn’t compete in Europe’s elite [competition].’",
      "Everybody but The Sun agrees that Trent Alexander-Arnold was poor on his Real Madrid debut while Marcus Rashford SHOCK emerges.",
      "Newcastle are ‘ready to offer’ the Manchester United star an escape route and are ‘confident of providing him with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’.",
      "Manchester United star Marcus Rashford would reportedly ‘accept a pay cut’ to join a rival Premier League club and there are ‘two’ teams ‘to watch’.",
      "Why send Marcus Rashford on loan when the alternatives aren’t as good? ‘Talent alone doesn’t go to United to die, sense does.’",
      "Manchester United will have to wait for a European giant to spring into action in the ‘latter stages’ of the summer transfer window for a sale, so hopes of it ...",

      "Everton could raid Man City for an unwanted duo, Arsenal and Liverpool might fancy a left-field signing, and Leeds should consider a Newcastle United outcast.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes, starting with two City cast-offs…",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker to Everton\nWalker might be past his best, but there’s no doubt he would improve the Everton back-line. And he’d fit in perfectly as another old fogey in a defence that’s already home to Seamus Coleman, who turns 37 in October. Walker turned 35 in May, while Nathan Patterson, 12 years his junior, remains awfully injury-prone.",
      "The England right-back would have to take a pay-cut to join Everton, but his desire to stay in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad trumps money, amid reported interest from Fenerbahce. That ambition paid off in January when the Manchester City defender chose AC Milan over Saudi Arabia, and has been rewarded with a 100% call-up rate under the new England boss. The same logic could apply if Walker joins Everton and performs at a decent level.",
      "He’s desperate to reach 100 caps. And while Fenerbahce are hardly a nothing club that would ruin those hopes, proving he can still cut it in the Premier League (not the Turkish Super Lig) would be far more beneficial to that end.",
      "As for Everton, there’s obviously some risk given Walker’s recent decline. But he’s still an upgrade on Coleman and Patterson, though the latter’s potential is miles beyond Walker’s current level.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish to Everton\nSticking with Manchester City players moving to Everton’s shiny new stadium, we’re very intrigued by the prospect of Grealish making this move.",
      "There’s reportedly interest from Serie A champions Napoli, which is obviously the better option, unless he doesn’t want to leave England. Grealish would be a pretty like-for-like replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who left Naples for Paris Saint-Germain in January, and the move would ensure he’s playing Champions League football next season.",
      "However, this is all about intra-Premier League transfers, so enough of that Italian muck. If recent rumours are anything to go by, Everton are showing real ambition ahead of their move from Goodison Park to the Hill Dickinson Stadium, with new owners the Friedkin Group keen to usher in a new era with better players. It makes sense; and if Man City can ship both Grealish and Walker off to Merseyside on permanent deals, they’ll be thrilled.",
      "We miss the old Grealish and reckon David Moyes might give him the freedom to express himself, even though his wingers do have defensive duties. Show him the love and let him thrive in the final third, and Grealish will repay it by tracking back and doing his bit in the low block. We really hope he stays in the Premier League.",

      "“People like to talk, don’t they? Well so do I. And I’ll say this – you’re about to see the best of me,” Sterling said after joining the Gunners on deadline day last August. No further comment.",
      "He scored a single goal (against League One Bolton) in 28 matches for Arsenal, and it’s clear his days of playing for a top club are behind him after spells with Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City.",
      "The 82-cap England international needs a fresh start, but we also reckon staying in London could be a crucial factor in where he goes next. He seems quite Fulham, doesn’t he? At Craven Cottage, Sterling can quietly go about his business and either score two in 30 or 15 in 30, and nobody would really bat an eyelid. Though the latter might even be enough to get him back into the England squad.",
      "Marco Silva needs to bolster his attack, particularly on the left, and if Sterling’s wage demands are realistic, the 30-year-old could enjoy a renaissance for Chelsea’s west London neighbours.",
      "",
      "Sean Longstaff to Leeds\nPlenty of Newcastle supporters will be happy to see Longstaff go, though there’ll be a few staunch Geordies upset to lose a homegrown player.",
      "What’s certain is that Eddie Howe’s Newcastle have outgrown him. Rumours of a move to Leeds make sense for both Daniel Farke and the player. He’s not the most exciting addition, but Premier League experience will be crucial if any of the promoted trio are to buck the trend and avoid the drop. Signing a bunch of youngsters from abroad isn’t going to cut it.",
      "Longstaff will run all day, and that sort of effort will quickly win over the Elland Road faithful. He can chip in with goals and is comfortable enough on the ball to hold his own in midfield for a newly promoted side.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho to Tottenham Hotspur\nGarnacho to Chelsea has been six months in the making, but at this point, he’s nothing more than an alternative to Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens. A move to the aforementioned Napoli now seems far more likely for the Argentine.",
      "With that in mind, we’ve gone with a transfer to Spurs, who are expected to miss out on Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, now bound for Manchester United.",
      "Six goals and two assists in 36 Premier League games in 2024/25 was an underwhelming return for a player tipped to become a star at Old Trafford. Even at 20, he needs a fresh start, and Ruben Amorim has reportedly made it clear that’s exactly what he should pursue.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez to Arsenal\nA transfer feature isn’t really a transfer feature without linking Arsenal with a striker. Darwin is admittedly a left-field option for Mikel Arteta, but the Spaniard’s eclectic transfer record means we wouldn’t put it past him. If he can turn Kai Havertz into a competent centre-forward, he might back himself to do the same with the Liverpool maverick.",

      "Marcus Rashford to Liverpool\nThis is another left-field ‘hear us out’ shout, but one we’re fully behind for multiple reasons, the most compelling of which is that it’d be really very funny.",
      "Arne Slot is thought to be prioritising a more natural striker than a wide forward, but Rashford is capable of playing through the middle – more so than Cody Gakpo or Luis Diaz, anyway. And with the latter being targeted by Barcelona, a cut-price Rashford could be the ideal signing to maintain the depth that helped Liverpool cruise to the Premier League title.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko to Brentford\nClearly in need of a left-back – having used Keane Lewis-Potter there for much of last season – Brentford could do a lot worse than Zinchenko. The Ukrainian is renowned for his world-class technical ability, even if his defending remains a concern.",
      "A move abroad still looks the likeliest outcome, but with a year left on his contract, Arsenal are desperate to sell this summer, opening the door for a surprise Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "Joao Felix to Wolves\nPortuguese? Check. Jorge Mendes client? You bet. Surplus to requirements at his current club? Absolutely. Welcome to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Joao Felix.",
      "We’ve already endorsed a move to Leeds, so it’s abundantly clear where we think his level is now after disappointing spells with Chelsea, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid. He’s still technically a Blues player but is certain to leave permanently this summer. Saudi Arabia feels extremely likely for the failed wonderkid, but the most plausible Premier League landing spot for him is Portugal C Wolves.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho to Crystal Palace\nAssuming they will be playing in Europe next season (these things always work themselves out), Palace will need a bit more depth across the pitch. They should feel confident going into a Europa League campaign with a manager who’s won the competition, and adding someone like Sancho would only add to that confidence.",
      "Sancho might think FA Cup winners Palace are beneath him, but we’re not so sure. He doesn’t have a future at Manchester United – even if Ruben Amorim hasn’t tried him out yet – and he flopped on loan at Chelsea, who paid £5m to send him back.",

      "The downfall of this once-great rivalry is underlined by the fact it’s now deemed insignificant enough to be scheduled for matchday one. Two title contenders rarely meet on the opening weekend. Some might argue there are exceptions – like Chelsea against Manchester City last year, or Roy Hodgson’s Liverpool against Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal – but if you genuinely believe those were title deciders in waiting, your head needs a wobble.",
      "We’ll admit the Emirates encounters between these two sides – even when United have been historically rubbish – have usually been fairly decent during Mikel Arteta’s reign. But the last two league matches in Manchester have been forgettable at best. The only thing Sky’s punditry team had to discuss at half- and full-time was the positioning of an Arsenal wall at a free-kick in March’s drab 1-1 draw.",

We’re bored already.",
      "Leeds are a big club with a rich history, sure, but the ‘too big for the Championship’ narrative is tired, and we’re not looking forward to it becoming prominent once again. They’ve spent three years out of a possible 21 in the top flight – and as many in League One. Maybe, after all, they belong in the Championship, bottling league titles and play-off finals.",

      "Not only will their Premier League history and the drunken Geordies take centre stage, but this is also the Carabao Cup final rematch. That adds such an important, significant layer to the fixture that we don’t need high-pitched Carragher excitement to hammer home how good it could be.",
      "Nor does it need clips of matches from a million years ago, or images of a dejected Kevin Keegan slumped over an advertising board. Do ancient clips with completely irrelevant players and managers really get people up for games in 2025?",

As the match nears, Sky will make you believe that missing it merits a death sentence, after they give the fixture a ridiculous name (THE EARLY DECIDER?).

Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",

      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",

      "Mbeumo can also create something from nothing. According to expected goals (xG), he scored nearly eight goals more than the quality of chances presented to him last season - more than any other player in the Premier League.",

      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo says he \"accepts\" the speculation surrounding his future amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Spurs have held initial discussions with Brentford about a deal for Mbeumo, who is more intrigued in a Spurs move now that Thomas Frank has been appointed head coach.",
      "Manchester United are also interested in Mbeumo, and had a bid rejected for him before Spurs started talks to hire Frank. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation, which is in excess of £60m.",
      "\"I think it can be the life of a footballer and you need to accept it.\"",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals in a Brentford side that finished 10th and narrowly missed out on European football.",
      "\"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League,\" he added. \"And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "Brentford's impressive season led to Spurs hiring Frank as their new head coach and Mbeumo expects the Dane to succeed at his new club.",
      "\"He's done so much for me. He literally trusted me from the start,\" Mbeumo said. \"I think he developed the team so well.",
      "\"He developed me as a human and a player as well. So I can only wish him all the best, and I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"I think he knows everything. He's really smart. He knows where he wants to bring the team, how he wants to play. I think he's been fantastic for Brentford.",
      "\"I think he's going to have some time to adapt, obviously. [Champions League] games, more expectations, as you said, but I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"He knows how to talk to people. He knows how to build a group. And that's why we've been playing so well.\"",

      "Andrews had been part of Frank's coaching staff since last year and is well-regarded within the club.",

      "Andrews is one of a handful of names Brentford are seriously considering, but a final decision has not yet been made.",
      "\"It's big shoes to fill,\" Mbeumo said. \"I think, (Frank had) seven years as a head coach. So, obviously it's going to be changing, but let's see.\"",

      "By Sky Germany",
      "Thursday 12 June 2025 22:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, according to Sky Germany.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea are also thought to be interested in the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal.",
      "It is understood United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for Ekitike with Frankfurt demanding around £85m (€100m).",
      "United are in the market for a striker after the arrival of Wolves' Matheus Cunha and the potential signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Chelsea and Liverpool considered among the next landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Read more about Hugo Ekitike's rise",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers."
