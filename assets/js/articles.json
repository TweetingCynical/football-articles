      "Marcus Rashford's humiliating debut for Barcelona comes almost 10 years after his first start for Manchester United, after which he was hailed by former team-mate Michael Carrick. Rashford joined the La Liga champions last week on a season-long loan move after becoming surplus to requirements under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "After kicking off life in Catalonia by training with his new team-mates, Rashford then flew out on the club's pre-season tour of Japan. A 3-1 victory over J-League side Vissel Kobe followed in what was his first match for the club.",
      "However, it was an embarrassing baptism for Rashford, who came on at half-time before being replaced in just the 78th minute. His low-key bow for Barca is worlds apart from when former United star Carrick gushed over Rashford's senior debut for his boyhood club in February 2016.",
      "Rashford was only 18 when he was brought into the United starting line-up against FC Midtjylland in the Europa League as a last-minute replacement for the injured Anthony Martial. He quickly announced himself to the world as he scored twice in a 5-1 United win.",
      "Afterwards, in what is a far cry from the reaction to his Barca debut, Carrick lauded Rashford. \"It's great. You can't put a price on that for the younger lads, especially Marcus. It's incredible and brings back memories for me, when I made my debut,\" Carrick told MUTV.",
      "\"It's what football's all about, and what this club has been about for so long. For a local lad to do that and come through the system like that, I'm delighted for him.\"",
      "After his first minutes for Barcelona, manager Hansi Flick explained why the 27-year-old came off just over half an hour after coming on. \"He's [a] week behind the others,\" Flick said.",
      "\"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us. The first 30 minutes were fantastic.",
      "\"After that we lost a bit of control, but the second half was also very good. I'm pleased. What they do with the ball, how they pressed us, it’s really interesting. You can tell they have a clear idea, and it’s similar to ours.\"",
      "Rashford hadn't played for United since December 2024 after being dropped by Amorin. He spent the second half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Barca have the option to make Rashford's deal permanent for £26million next summer after he was handed the No. 14 shirt, previously worn by Thierry Henry at the club. Since arriving, he has claimed that his new residence feels like home.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford told Barcelona's YouTube channel upon his unveiling. \"It's a club where people's dreams come true, they win big prizes. What the club stands for means a lot for me.",
      "\"I feel like I'm at home and a big factor in my choice to come here is because it is a family place and a good place for good players to showcase their skills. Another factor is because the conversations I had with [Hansi Flick] were positive.",
      "\"What he did last season was terrific. To lead such a young team to a very successful season and come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club and it's everything I wished. I'm eager to learn the Barcelona way.\"",
      "Next up for Barcelona is a friendly against Seoul in the South Korean capital on Thursday. Rashford will have a reunion with ex-United team-mate Jesse Lingard, who captains the K-League side.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford suffered one of the biggest humiliations a top-level footballer can endure on Sunday. The Manchester United forward completed what he hoped to be a dream loan move to Barcelona last week as he looks to get his career back on track.",
      "The deal, which was finalised in time for Rashford to fly to Japan with the rest of the Barca squad, gives the La Liga champions an option to buy the forward for £26million at the end of the season. Rashford’s first pre-season outing came against Japanese side Vissel Kobe, where he started the game on the bench.",
      "Flick brought the 27-year-old on for his much-anticipated debut at half-time, with Rashford showing glimpses of promise and working hard to track back in his new Blaugrana colours. However, he was quickly cut down to size as manager Hansi Flick took him off after just 33 minutes, moments after playing a key role in Barcelona’s second goal.",
      "Rashford and left-back Jofre Torrents made way for Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, who scored Barca’s third goal. While the substitution would have stung Rashford, Flick explained that his decision was not performance related, saying: \"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury.\"",
      "Just seven days ago, Rashford had been part of United’s ‘bomb squad’ – the group training alone and made to use the club’s Carrington training ground only once the first-team squad had gone home for the day.",
      "One player who knows exactly how Rashford would have felt this weekend is former Tottenham midfielder Hossam Ghaly. He was signed by Spurs in 2006 and was used sporadically by then-head coach Martin Jol during the 2006/07 season.",
      "After being in and out of the squad, the Egyptian was brought on against Blackburn Rovers in the first half of the penultimate game of the Premier League season after an injury to Steed Malbranque. But, like Rashford, he found himself substituted 31 minutes after his introduction – only his substitution WAS due to a poor performance.",
      "Unlike Rashford, Ghaly responded in the worst possible way, furiously throwing his shirt on the ground while walking off the pitch. The act infuriated the Spurs faithful as jeers and chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” rang around the stadium.",
      "Ghaly was disciplined by the club and left out of the matchday squad on the final day of the season, before making a public apology. He said: \"I am just so angry with myself. I have always considered it an honour to wear the Tottenham shirt and I never intended to show any disrespect.",
      "\"I knew things weren't happening for me out there, my play was terrible and I could hear the crowd jeering me.",
      "\"I was so upset at the fans' reaction. I have enjoyed playing in front of the club's supporters all season and I felt I had given my best all the time and played some decent football.",
      "\"It is always hard to accept being substituted after such a short period of time and I was upset and taken aback by the cheering. I am a player who plays with my heart.",
      "\"I know my reaction was totally wrong,\" he added. \"I have apologised to the manager and I also want to apologise to the fans. I hope they don't judge me on this incident alone. I have tried hard for the club this season.\"",
      "Despite his best efforts at reconciliation, it marked Ghaly’s last game for Spurs as he was sent out on loan to Derby County in January 2008. He returned to north London for the 2008/09 season but didn’t play a single game before his permanent departure.",
      "Harry Redknapp considered bringing him on during a January 2009 clash with Wigan, but the Englishman decided against it after hearing the fans boo Ghaly while he was warming up and preparing to come on off the bench.",
      "Rashford will want to avoid such a fate at Barcelona, though he will also hope that Flick does not make a habit of subjecting him to external ridicule. The England international has had his fair share of spats with United managers Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim in recent years.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "England midfielder Ella Toone was playing in memory of her late father as she helped the Lionesses win another European Championship. Nick Toone was diagnosed with prostate cancer the day after he watched Ella score in the 2022 final, as England beat Germany 2-1 at Wembley.",
      "In September of last year, Nick died three days short of his 60th birthday. \"For the past few months, I've been trying to figure it all out, trying to get unstuck,\" Ella wrote for the Players' Tribune in January.",
      "\"It's still raw. I still feel the pain digging in, the gutting feeling of not having him here anymore.\"",
      "The Manchester United vice-captain continues to be inspired by her dad and topped off her most challenging season yet with another international trophy. Toone started all but one of England's matches on their way to the final and produced another lung-busting display against Spain.",
      "She was replaced by Beth Mead in the 87th minute, as the Lionesses dug in and took the game to extra-time and penalties before getting their hands on the trophy for the second time in three years. Post-match, Toone shared two emotional Instagram stories and revealed that her mum had been sat next to a spare seat at the final in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "\"Spare seat next to my mum tonight,\" she wrote alongside an image of the empty seat. \"If that's not a sign I don't know what is. I know you were there Dad. Love you cock.\"",
      "Toone also posted a selfie with Mead - who lost her mum, Jane, to ovarian cancer in January 2023 - with the caption: \"We did it for our angels in the sky. Forever with us & forever proud.\"",
      "Who was your Player of the Tournament for England? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "One of Ella's aunties, Tracy Haslam, told the BBC ahead of the tournament: \"He went to all the away games, he went to the World Cup [in 2023]. He used to be right by her side all the time when it came to a football.",
      "\"It's just a bit harder now her dad's not here. There's a lot of firsts when you lose someone close. It's quite hard for when she plays a game, you can see it sometimes, that she misses him.\"",
      "Nick will be proudly looking down on Ella, who scored two goals and provided two assists during England's successful campaign. She also helped United finish third in the Women's Super League last season, having been at the club since they turned professional in 2018.",
      "Sarina Wiegman's legends have made history and brought football home once more after defending their title and winning Euro 2025 in Switzerland. We have produced this special souvenir edition of the Women's Football News.",

      "Liverpool have been very busy this summer and attention has now turned to TWO more massive deals. The Reds continue to chase Newcastle star Alexander Isak and could see their coffers bolstered with the sale of Luis Diaz - who is on the verge of joining Bayern Munich.",
      "Over at Arsenal, it appears that the Gunners are not yet satisfied with their summer business. Attention has now turned to Ebererchi Eze, with a £60million deal for the Crystal Palace playmaker being prepared by the Gunners. They are not the only team who are busy right now.",
      "Manchester United are in the market for a striker and it appears that Benjamin Sesko is high up on their shopping list. Elsewhere, Manchester City are poised to announce the signing of Burnley's James Trafford, while Newcastle are in talks with Southampton to sign England's Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Liverpool are aiming to move on THREE first team stars in afford to afford Newcastle's eye-watering asking price for Alexander Isak.",
      "The Reds are right at the front of the queue for the Swedish striker but any deal won't be cheap, with Newcastle aiming to earn around £150m. But Liverpool have a few players they are willing to sell in order to get a deal done.",
      "With Luis Diaz on the verge of a move to Bayern Munich, Liverpool will then reportedly aim to move on Harvey Elliott, Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa, all of which could earn the Reds around £100m as per ESPN.",
      "Chelsea are reportedly set to reject interest in left-back Marc Cucurella amid rumours that he is under consideration by Al-Nassr.",
      "It was recently suggested that the Spanish defender was being eyed by the Saudi Pro League side amid another summer recruitment drive. But it appears that Chelsea are in no mood to negotiate.",
      "As per our colleagues at football.london, the Blues have no intention of selling Cucurella this summer.",
      "Tottenham prodigy Mikey Moore is poised to join Rangers on loan.",
      "The highly-rated attacker, 17, has had loan interest from a host of Championship clubs.",
      "But The Telegraph report that Rangers are now the red-hot favourites to land the talented teenager.",
      "By Chris McKenna",
      "Luis Diaz has now left Liverpool's pre-season tour in Tokyo and is on a flight to Munich.",
      "The Colombian will undergo a medical before signing a five-year contract with the Bundesliga giants after the Reds agreed a £65m deal to sell Diaz over the weekend.",
      "Newcastle have turned their attention to Southampton goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale after missing out on James Trafford.",
      "Southampton will consider a sale, having been relegated to the Championship and with Gavin Bazunu back fit.",
      "Newcastle want to take the 27-year-old on an initial loan with an option to buy.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is keen on a move to Manchester United.",
      "Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Ambitious moves for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma have gone nowhere, but Lammens is available for €15-20million (£13-17m).",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters after sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him.",
      "\"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",
      "Liverpool are selling Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich. That much is certain. But the fee they are receiving is less so.",

      "That is a guaranteed £58.6m, plus £6.5m in add-ons.",
      "As we reported earlier, Joao Felix is heading to Al-Nassr for an initial fee of £26million which could rise to £43.7m with add-ons.",
      "That is a good result for the Blues, but they still have work to do in terms of flogging unwanted players.",

      "Everton want to sign Luiz on loan, while Juve want to secure as much money as possible, either with an obligation to buy or a straight transfer. His agent, Kia Joorabchian, is on the case.",

      "Liverpool are reportedly preparing an offer for Alexander Isak this week.",
      "Isak has told Newcastle he wants to leave this summer and Liverpool are his preference. The Reds have spent over £265million already in this window but still have wiggle room in their budget, especially with Luis Diaz leaving for £65m in the coming days.",
      "They enquired for Isak before signing Hugo Ekitike and will now test Newcastle's resolve. The Magpies have said he isn't for sale and have slapped a £150m price tag on him. Watch this space.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool have both been linked with Real Madrid forward Rodrygo this summer - and now the Spanish giants are ready to do business.",
      "Spanish newspaper AS says Xabi Alonso wants to get rid of five players in the coming weeks, with Rodrygo the most high profile.",
      "Having previously valued him at €90million (£76.8m), they are now willing to do business for below that fee.",
      "Alfie Doughty is set to undergo a medical ahead of a permanent move to Millwall.",

      "Al-Nassr have snapped up one Premier League flop - and now they want another one!",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is heading to Saudi Arabia for an initial fee of £26million that could rise to around £43m with add-ons.",
      "And now the club of Cristiano Ronaldo are targeting Manchester United winger Antony, who revived his career with a loan move to Real Betis last season. Al-Nassr have made a bid for the Brazilian, whose agent has said he would be open to moving to the Middle East.",
      "Alexander Isak to Liverpool is still a possibility, but Darwin Nunez is unlikely to be going in the opposite direction as part of a swap deal.",
      "Luis Diaz's move to Bayern Munich would appear to have put paid to that, with Newcastle looking at Benjamin Sesko as an alternative striker option.",
      "Luis Diaz is on his way to Bayern Munich for £65.5million and the German club are clearing a path for him.",
      "Sky Sport Germany says that Bryan Zaragoza is heading to Celta Vigo on loan with an obligation to buy, just 18 months after arriving from Granada.",

      "PSG's move could spring United into action, with Ruben Amorim keen on a new goalkeeper of his own. The Red Devils are understood to be interested in Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens, who'd provide competition for Andre Onana.",
      "Although Onana has no plans to leave Old Trafford, the Cameroonian's form has been an issue for Amorim. The United manager even took the 29-year-old out of the firing line towards the end of last season after a string of mistakes.",
      "But instead of signing an up-and-coming shot-stopper like Lammens, the vastly experienced Donnarumma could be an option after privately discussing a move to England with his Italy team-mates. French outlet L'Equipe report that as PSG prepare to welcome Chevalier, both United and rivals Manchester City have registered their interest in Donnarumma.",
      "Chelsea have also been linked with a move while Galatasaray are said to have gone a step further by making a formal approach. It'd be a surprise if City put their hat in the ring after they struck a £27m deal with Burnley to re-sign James Trafford.",

      "\"My priority is to stay at PSG, I don't think there will be any problems in the negotiations,\" Donnarumma told Sky Italia on June 9. \"We're a great team.\"",
      "Napoli have also been linked with Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - dismissed the speculation by labelling it 'pure fantasy'. \"I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project.",
      "\"In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juventus who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganising: these factors are fundamental.\"",

      "They say it is the biggest humiliation a footballer can experience: being a substitute that, after getting on the pitch, is then subbed off. So why did Hansi Flick bring on Marcus Rashford for 30 minutes on his Barcelona debut - and then take him off again?",
      "Rashford, 27, appeared for the first since completing his season-long loan move from Manchester United in midweek, ending his exile at Old Trafford. The forward's transfer - which includes a £26million option to buy - was finalised in time for him to fly to Japan with the rest of Barca's squad, as they embark on a pre-season tour of Asia. First up was a clash with Japanese side Vissel Kobe in a friendly match which was initially suspended before organisers scrambled to make it happen.",
      "Rashford was named on the bench by Flick before the German changed his entire line-up at half-time. The United loanee showed promise during his 30-minute cameo, notably playing a crucial role when fellow new signing Roony Bardghji got on the scoresheet in Barcelona's 3-1 win.",
      "After defender Jofre Torrents won back possession on the left, Rashford collected the ball and played a perfectly-weighted pass through to Robert Lewandowski. Barca's No.9 then picked out Bardghji on the right, as the former Copenhagen hotshot produced an impressive first-time finish.",
      "Seconds later, Rashford was brought off. The England international and Torrents were replaced by Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, scorer of Barcelona's third goal, in the 77th minute.",
      "Post-match, Flick was asked about his decision to haul both Rashford and Torrents off after half an hour each.",
      "\"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury,\" the Barcelona manager explained. Which, obviously, makes perfect sense for a player who, just seven days ago, was a member of Manchester United's 'bomb squad' training alone and made to use the club's Carrington training ground when the first-team squad had gone home.",
      "For Flick, these early days are about getting Rashford up to speed, slowly but surely, helping him adjust to what he wants. Do it correctly, and it's another match winner among Barca's collection of stars. Subbing him on and then off in a pre-season friendly? Not a problem for the manager nor his new player.",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Flick was a 'key' reason why Rashford joined the La Liga champions, having led Barcelona to three trophies in his first season. \"He was another key factor for me to join Barca,\" the 27-year-old revealed during his unveiling.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive. He has proven to be one of the top coaches... He led a young team to such a successful season and has returned to the preseason wanting more.\"",
      "Rashford's team-mates are already looking forward to playing alongside him. \"Rashford is a very talented player,\" Lewandowski told reporters in Japan.",
      "\"We played Manchester United two years ago and he was in great form. He can help us and is able to play in different positions.\"",

      "And while United eventually managed to get their man, they weren’t left particularly happy with the actions of their colleagues at Brentford. Red Devils chiefs had been left furious with Brentford’s attempts to sell Mbeumo elsewhere, with Newcastle, Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal all reportedly interested.",
      "United have accused Brentford of attempting to convince the forward to lower his wage demands, while they also thought the Bees increased their demands once a deal was close.",
      "And given the hostility between the two clubs at the current time, United have threatened to make things even worse by moving for a Brentford target. According to The Sun, both sides are going head to head for Metz youngster Idrissa Gueye.",
      "The teenager has emerged as a key target for Keith Andrews this summer, who may be forced to match the French side’s asking price of £15m for Gueye to fight off competition from United and Burnley. It is suggested that the London side would be willing to offer the youngster instant Premier League football, while United see him as one for the future.",
      "Gueye, 18, is a product of the Metz academy and went on to score five goals in 17 Ligue 2 appearances last term. And he now faces a decision over his future, albeit United will hope that he follows in the footsteps of Mbeumo, who was only interested in signing for the Red Devils.",

      "Signing a player compared to Erling Haaland is one thing - but signing one many believe is better? Now that's a mouthwatering prospect. For Manchester United, that prospect may become reality if they land Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The RB Leipzig striker, who is being linked with a blockbuster £60million move to Old Trafford, had the unenviable task of filling Haaland's shoes at Red Bull Salzburg. In just half a season in Austria, a teenage Haaland smashed 28 goals in 22 games before sealing a career-launching switch to Borussia Dortmund - turning down United in the process.",
      "A year later, Sesko arrived at Salzburg with the same towering frame, explosive playing style, and sky-high expectations. The comparisons to Haaland were inevitable. And while he wasn't quite as ruthless in front of goal, Sesko made just as big an impression - and, in the eyes of some, an even bigger one.",
      "\"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy,\" the Slovenian said in 2021. \"They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn so I can be even better than he is.",
      "\"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "Sesko's rise hasn't been as meteoric as Haaland's, but if he secures a Premier League move this summer, he'll have done so at the same age his Norwegian counterpart made the leap. Arsenal looked set to sign the 22-year-old earlier in the window, but ultimately pivoted to Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea have also shown interest in Sesko, but after signing Hugo Ekitike and Liam Delap respectively, both clubs now look out of the running. This has given United something of a free run at the striker, but a deal is far from guaranteed.",
      "The Red Devils have already splashed £133m on attacking reinforcements, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - and with concerns about the club's financial situation lingering, any further moves must be approached with caution.",
      "Then there's the matter of convincing Sesko himself. Without Champions League football on offer, United are at a disadvantage against several domestic and European rivals. And with the striker tied to RB Leipzig until 2029, neither he nor the club are under pressure to make a decision quickly.",
      "United will also be hoping Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season, has had a change of heart since turning down a move to Old Trafford in 2023, opting instead for RB Leipzig - a decision he later attributed to concerns over United's style of play.",
      "\"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations [about which club I would sign for]. But I think it was better to come [to RB Leipzig],\" Sesko admitted in 2024.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "Now, with a new manager, a fresh attacking core, and a point to prove, United are hoping the timing - and the project - feel different this time around.",
      "If they can convince Sesko that Old Trafford is where he can become not just the next Haaland, but the first Sesko, it could mark the beginning of a new era - one built not just on reputation or comparisons, but on potential fully realised in red.",

      "Fernandes scored both goals in United's 2-1 win over West Ham at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, the first from the penalty spot and the second a sublime strike from 20 yards out.",
      "The United skipper said he would have happily left in the summer, with Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal willing to pay £100million for him, if the club decided it was time to cash in on their prized asset.",
      "But United stuck to their stance that Fernandes was not for sale, despite the huge offer from Al Hilal for a player who turns 31 in less than two months.",
      "And after Fernandes produced a man-of-the-match display to get United's Stateside tour off to a winning start, boss Amorim underlined why he remains such a key player.",
      "“It was so clear last season,” said Amorim. “You can see it in the assists, the goals, but not just that. I think now he has more players [around him]. I've felt that on the tour. I feel that now there are more players to help him to lead the group. That is a good thing.",
      "“But he's our leader, so he's really important. Not just on the field, but also off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and sometimes he plays with pain.",
      "“The problem is that sometimes he gets frustrated and sometimes he loses a little bit of the focus of his job. Sometimes he wants to help his team-mates so much that sometimes it's not the best thing to do.",
      "“They all have to learn. They have to do their job. Bruno also has to wait for the ball in different situations. This kind of thing is what a leader does, but he needs help and he's going to have help.",
      "“Bruno has a function or a position for every game. It's impossible to play in all of the positions. Last year I felt that sometimes I pushed him back, to have more possession in the build-up, and then we missed Bruno near the box.",
      "“I think with different characteristics, with Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo, I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, I think he will have more help this season.",
      "“Bruno runs a lot. Maybe in the sprint he's a different player, but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance. He's smart. The physicality of Bruno is not the concern. He's ready for the physicality, playing deep or as a midfielder.”",
      "Amorim picked a strong team against West Ham and revealed he did so because he needs the team that is likely to start the season to get up to speed as quickly as possible.",
      "“It was a strong team because we need to prepare all the players,” said Amorim. “We needed to take this game seriously. We don't have a lot of weeks, a lot of games to prepare all of the team, but that can change. It's rare that the team plays more than an hour on their first tour game.",
      "“But I was expecting this from the team at this moment. We have all the data, all the information. We know that at this stage they can cope with 70 minutes with a high tempo. So it wasn't a surprise.”",

      "Daily Mirror Manchester Football Correspondent, covering Manchester United and Manchester City. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "After the pain and misery of last season, there was much for Ruben Amorim to be optimistic about after Manchester United's opening US tour game.",
      "Ending last season in 15th place – United's lowest finish for 51 years – and missing out on Europe for only the second time in 35 years have made this a crucial pre-season.",
      "Against that backdrop, United began their three-game tour of the States with an impressive performance against Premier League rivals West Ham at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.",
      "Here is what United boss Amorim will have learned from his team's hard-fought win...",
      "New £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha impressed with his attacking threat and industry, while midfielder Manuel Ugarte pressed with intensity and striker Rasmus Hojlund looked sharp and hungry.",
      "There were other plus points for Amorim – Kobbie Mainoo's influence in a deeper midfield role, Patrick Dorgu's marauding runs down the left and the enduring quality of skipper Bruno Fernandes, who gave United a first-half lead from the penalty spot.",
      "The crowd at the venue for next year's World Cup final may have been sparse – the 80,000-capacity stadium half-full at most – but fans were treated to a competitive game.",
      "Former United managers have made wholesale changes at half-time in pre-season games, but Amorim's plan was to play his starting line-up until the 70th minute, to build up their fitness levels, before making substitutions.",
      "Amorim picked a strong side, although new £71m signing Bryan Mbeumo was left out, with his pre-season preparation slightly behind that of his team-mates.",
      "Pre-season games, particularly the opening ones, can be tepid affairs, with players minded to ease themselves into games gently, for fear of injury or pushing themselves too much.",
      "But United played with a fervour and commitment, epitomised by Ugarte's willingness to snap into tackles and win back possession within seconds of his side losing it.",
      "United served notice of their intent early on, Cunha winning the ball just outside his own area, Dorgu finding Fernandes, who in turn put Hojlund through on goal.",
      "The much-maligned striker, who managed just 12 goals last season, outpaced Max Kilman before striking a post with a left-footed effort.",
      "Minutes later United were in front after West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola dropped the ball then fouled Ayden Heaven in a clumsy attempt to retrieve it, Fernandes coolly dispatching the resulting spot-kick.",
      "With Amorim urging his players to maintain their rhythm and intensity, all the more impressive in the oppressive 80 F temperature, United continued to dominate.",
      "Hojlund scooped a shot over in the 16th minute, while Cunha's tenacity in retrieving the ball and winning a corner led to Leny Yoro heading just wide. Ugarte won possession and fed Amad, who applied a clinical finish, but the goal was ruled out for offside.",
      "But United doubled their lead in the 52nd minute, Mainoo intercepting a poor pass out from Areola then finding Fernandes, who steered a sublime finish into the top left corner.",
      "With the 70 minute mark looming and United's starting line-up tiring, Jarrod Bowen pulled a goal back for Hammers with a fine angled finish, which prompted Amorim to make 10 outfield changes slightly earlier than he planned.",
      "Those who came on struggled to keep possession as assuredly as the starting line-up, allowing West Ham more time on the ball and meaning United came under sustained pressure to maintain their lead and see out the game, which they duly did, with Altay Bayindir making a fine save to deny Bowen a second goal deep into added time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo didn't feature for Manchester United against West Ham because he is behind in his preparations compared to the rest of his teammates.",
      "The £71 million signing from Brentford completed the move a day before the squad flew out to Chicago for the club's pre-season tour in the United States. He was signed after the drab 0-0 draw against Leeds in Stockholm, Sweden.",
      "Mbeumo has trained with his new colleagues in recent days and travelled to the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey but was a notable absence on the teamsheet. It appears he is not quite match fit, with Brentford starting their pre-season preparations a week after United.",
      "Amorim has already proven himself a tough manager when it comes to fitness and Mbeumo's absence follows a similar trend of decisions by the Portuguese. Noussair Mazraoui was another key player missing, with the defender absent through a 'knock'.",
      "Fellow new recruit Matheus Cunha, who arrived after his £62.5 million release clause at Wolves was triggered, did start in what was a reasonably strong starting XI against West Ham.",
      "Altay Bayinder started in goal amid Andre Onana's own injury problems, with Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven ahead of him. Amad and Patrick Dorgu operated in the wing back roles with Mainoo and Ugarte playing central midfield. Bruno Fernandes, Rasmus Hojlund and Cunha led the line.",
      "United ran out 2-1 winners thanks to two goals from Fernandes. Jarrod Bowen pulled one back on the hour mark as the Red Devils held out for a win.",
      "Amorim's team will face Bournemouth on Wednesday but Mbeumo will have to wait beyond that to get his first minutes. The United boss is instead hopeful Mbeumo will play against Everton on Sunday. While his fitness may be a slight concern, there should be no worries over his mentality.",
      "\"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up,\" the forward declared upon signing.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",

      "After recording 45 minutes of first team action against Leeds, Matheus Cunha played another 65 minutes for Manchester United against West Ham on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's side won the encounter 2-1 and while Bruno Fernandes netted both in a man of the match display, Cunha also impressed.",
      "The 26-year-old arrived from Wolves for £62.5 million and, quite frankly, he's a player United have been crying out for. Forgetting the goals he will bring, Cunha's physicality and zealous nature will be warmly welcome at Old Traffford.",
      "After just two minutes, Cunha's best work was at the other end of the pitch. Mucking in on the edge of United's box, the Brazilian won the ball back to turn over possession. His aggression ultimately led to Hojlund baring down on goal and hitting the post.",
      "There's a clear need for him to prove himself and there was no greater example than his long shot at goal midway through the first half. Maybe it was a little eager but it was positive and direct.",
      "His ability to use either foot, as he feigned on one and hit it with the other, will also prove problematic for defenders.",
      "After 35 minutes when his pass to Hojlund on the edge of the box didn't pay off, his verocious nature to win the ball back led to him earning the opportunity of a shot on goal. It was ultimately blocked but the desire was more promising than the end product.",
      "Amorim stuck with his starting XI at half-time, resisting the urge to make wholesale changes to get as many minutes in as many different legs as possible. Perhaps a hint that he is finding his strongest XI already. Cunha is very much a part of that.",
      "Just moments into the second half Cunha broke through the Hammers midfield, driving the ball forward more like a rugby player than a footballer. He did something similar against Leeds too.",
      "That ability to be tough to tackle and burst through the ranks as United transition from defence to attack is something they desperately need.",
      "And to prove his earlier defensive heroics weren't a fluke, on the hour mark he was sliding to win the ball again. His crucial touch was followed by Amad also sliding to win the ball. United won it back.",
      "With the exception of the ever-exasperated Fernandes, it oftentimes felt last season as though only the young Ivory Coast international was the one willing to chase down every ball and put in the effort. Cunha is willing too.",
      "While attitude question marks off the pitch remain, there is no doubting his voracious nature on it.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's summer has seen them land two marquee arrivals, costing them more than £120million, but more was expected of the Red Devils in the transfer market.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha will bolster the team's attack with Ruben Amorim claiming either man could play as a central striker if needs must. The United boss has also claimed he's happy to press on with his squad as it looks despite the lack of change.",
      "He said during the club's pre-season tour: \"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player. If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last term, but Amorim has been afforded the chance to work with his team on his philosophy and system throughout pre-season. That wasn't a luxury he had last term with United's recruitment potentially slowing down.",
      "United have been linked with moves for the likes of Emi Martinez, having a loan approach rejected by Aston Villa, and the MEN understands there is not currently a budget set aside to fund a new No.1 for the club.",
      "Despite not having the funds to go after a new goalkeeper Andre Onana has made it clear he wants to stay in Manchester and has received reassurances that he won't be sold or replaced.",
      "The most likely departure there would perhaps be Altar Bayindir with Tom Heaton, the veteran goalkeeper on the club's books, recently extending his deal. Onana was dropped for a match last term by Amorim, but he still remains the first choice going into the new season.",
      "Amorim has dismissed the notion that Mbeumo and Cunha both choose to move to Manchester to increase their pay cheques given they had offers elsewhere that would've seen them play in the Champions League. The United boss claimed it is \"lies\" to consider the duo only made the switch because of financial motives.",
      "He told the club's website: “Cunha and Bryan, they had different solutions [offers]. They had Champions League offers. And they wanted to come here. People that say that they come here because of the money… that is a lie. That I know for sure. So, I’m really happy with that.",
      "“That is the key point. They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project. And then one really important thing is that they want to come here.\"",
      "Cole Palmer has been tipped to join move to United in the future despite his Chelsea deal tying him down until 2033. Former Red Devils coach Rene Meulensteen told Grosvenor Casino: \"It’s almost a public secret that Cole Palmer is a Manchester United fan, what surprised me is how he slipped through the fingers of United with him being at Manchester City and then getting his chance at Chelsea.",
      "“He is a player that can make a difference, could he play for United in the future? Yeah, I can't see why not. Obviously, he's got a long-term contract with Chelsea, but sometimes things don't work out and players and clubs fall out, then United would be interested and it could be a really good destination for him. He is a United fan after all and he is a player that would bring United back to a higher level.\"",

      "Manchester United did something they're not very good at and scored twice against West Ham to win at the MetLife on Sunday morning.",
      "United travelled to New Jersey from Chicago to take on the Hammers at the same venue where Chelsea hoisted the Club World Cup alongside Donald Trump not two weeks ago. And it was their captain they relied upon once again with Bruno Fernandes scoring both.",
      "The first came from the spot after a messy Alphonse Areola catch led to Ayden Heaven being fouled. The second came just after the interval after another mistake from the Hammers keeper. Kobbie Mainoo capitalized to tee up Fernandes who produced a sublime finish.",
      "Jarrod Bowed grabbed one back on the hour mark and had another late chance stopped by Altay Bayinder as United grabbed a rare but much-needed win.",
      "The starting XI: Altay Bayindir, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Patrick Dorgu, Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha, Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "And it stayed that way until the 65th minute. The fact this team lasted more than an hour shows you where Amorim's head is with his preferred players. Add to the context Bryan Mbeumo wasn't quite ready, Noussair Mazraoui was carrying a knock, and Joshua Zirkzee wasn't in the squad, it's clear the United boss is using pre-season to get his strongest side playing their strongest football as soon as possible. It's a luxury he didn't get last year.",
      "United looked sharp, carried a zip and an energy to their play that hasn't been seen for some time. Most pleasing for Amorim will no doubt be the positivity. There's a long way to go but the pressing was also improved. The defence helped the midfield and the midfield helped the attack. A marked improvement.",
      "The need for additions is still obvious but perhaps fans may get to see a little more of what Amorim wants to do.",
      "Depending on where Amorim sees Mazraoui and Shaw, United's back three of Yoro, De Ligt, and Heaven, is about as strong as it comes. It may well be the back three that starts against Arsenal in three weeks' time.",
      "De Ligt played in the anchor role at the back, mopping up scraggly chances and loose balls. And beside the Dutchman he had Yoro on the right and Heaven on the left. While not perfect, the performance of the three was solid. If a little untidy at times, it did its job in the main.",
      "The worry for Amorim should be that this was against a pretty lifeless West Ham attack. The prospect of those three facing Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli is a little unnerving.",
      "While still raw, the talent in Yoro is clear. He needs more time. Heaven is even younger and Bowen's goal is a prime example that he has much to learn in anticipation and shutting down attackers.",
      "Does the back three have potential? Yes. Is it a top four defence? No. Far from it.",
      "It's worth remembering that Hojlund is only 22 years of age. And despite his form last season there's never a United side that should have relied upon him as their out-and-out goalscorer. That notwithstanding, it was him or Joshua Zirkzee. Zirkzee is not a striker, he's a false nine or a 10 who, at times, had United fans licking their lips with his quick feet and link-up play.",
      "So that leaves Hojlund. After a mere two minutes he showed his three best attributes - speed, strength and mentality. After Cunha won the ball on the edge of the box, Hojlund found himself on the break one v one with West Ham defender Max Kilman. Hojlund outmuscled him, sprinted past him and found himself with an opportunity on goal.",
      "That's where his weakest attribute came in - finishing. The shot was fierce and smashed off the left upright. It was a good chance he carved out for himself but he couldn't apply the finishing touch.",
      "Only moments later he found himself with the ball at his feet in the penalty area. The result was a ballooned shot over the bar. It's always a snatched shot or a power strike rather than a caressed finish for Hojlund. There's no doubting his determination to chase down every ball but that's not enough.",
      "At times last season the Dane was left frustrated by Alejandro Garnacho's selfishness. But with Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha he can expect a lot more service this time around. However, Amorim will need decide quick if he gambles on his goals coming from his two new signings via Zirkzee or from a hit or miss Hojlund.",
      "Amorim has never quite figured out where he wants to play Fernandes. In part, that's due to him being so good the United boss probably wishes he could play him in five positions.",
      "But Amorim did make a mistake in the Europa League final dropping Fernandes deep. Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro had established a semi-solid partnership through the previous European games. The captain replacing Ugarte left not only a hole in attack but created an inability to stop Spurs running through the midfield.",
      "Casemiro's age and Ugarte's legs have left a lot to be desired and it is why United are crying out for a defensive midfielder. It is therefore interesting that Fernandes started in one of the No. 10 positions against West Ham. He was instrumental in several transitions of attack, linking up with Cunha a little better than he did with Hojlund.",
      "His cross ultimately led to Areola's blunder which the penalty came from and it was of course he who slotted neatly from the penalty spot. Like usual, he had no problem bossing his teammates about but it felt a little more commanding coming from an attacking position.",
      "And because he was further forward he was also in a position to delicately curl one past Areola for United's second.",
      "And because Fernandes was further forward it meant Kobbie Mainoo partnered Ugarte in midfield. While at times the common vulnerability of teams running through the pair did show, like when Tomas Soucek had too much room to slot in Bowen, there was still some promise.",
      "Prior to kick-off Amorim declared that he has \"Big plans\" for Mainoo while lauding his talent. And it was on this very pitch two years ago that Mainoo's performance against Arsenal in pre-season caught the eye. It's fitting that he once again purred on the ball.",
      "His silky footwork and confidence on the ball drew \"Oohs\" and \"Aahs\" from the crowd. But perhaps what Amorim will be most pleased with was his doggedness to win the ball. Mainoo raced onto Areola's poor goalkick to intercept the ball in the second half. He quickly fed it to Fernandes who produced a sumptuous finish.",
      "His partner, Ugarte, flattered to deceive last season but did show a side to his play not many have seen. The Uruguayan quickly won the ball back after Mainoo ran into a Claret wall. He proceeded to nutmeg one player before feeding through Amad who neatly slotted away his chance. Unfortunately for the pair it was offside.",
      "It's not rock solid, as Bowen's goal showed, but it was better than last season.",

      "Alan Shearer claims Manchester United are \"four top players away from challenging for the top six\" despite the Red Devils spending more than £130million on the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Ruben Amorim presided over a horror campaign last term as United finished 15th in the Premier League, and marked improvements are now being demanded after a summer on the training pitch and some shrewd recruitment.",
      "The club have been keen to bolster their misfiring attack this summer, alongside Mbeumo and Cunha, Diego Leon has been added, but there are several issues that still exist within the United squad and Shearer claims they have a number of problems areas to address before they can even think about trying to qualify for the Europa League.",
      "United are yet to add a No 9 given the struggles experienced by the likes of Rasmus Hojlund. No new wing-backs have come in despite Amorim playing a 3-4-3 formation and they continue to persevere with Andre Onana in goal.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: \"Last year was a disaster for Man United. It will be better than that this season I've no doubt, but how much better will depend on how much business they do between now and the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"There's no doubt they need a top-class centre-forward which would go well with Cunha and Mbuemo so they've still got business to do and it depends on what quality they bring in. Even with just Cunha and Mbuemo, there's no doubt they'll improve on last season. As I said, they're still three, maybe four top players away from challenging for the top six.\"",
      "Amorim has claimed that, should he begin the season against Arsenal in mid-August with his current squad then he would be happy. However concerns remain around United, who ended up being 24 points off the Champions League spots and 42 off champions Liverpool.",
      "Shearer has also been quick to point out that Mbeumo, one of their major recruits, will leave midseason to take part in the Africa Cup of Nations. That will place more pressure on United's depth.",
      "He said: \"Mbuemo will likely be going to AFCON, but you know that when you sign these players. You just have to get on with it and accept it. He'll be a big player for Man United so to be without him for that amount of time will hurt him and Man United but other clubs will have the same problem.\"",
      "United have reportedly had a loan offer for Emi Martinez turned down. Aston Villa have also made it clear that Ollie Watkins is not for sale. Earlier in the summer Liam Delap, who was on the club's radar, picked a move to Chelsea ahead of a switch to Manchester.",

    "body": [
      "Ruben Amorim has been on Kobbie Mainoo’s case to increase his “rhythm and pace”. Mainoo was quick to intercept Alphonse Areola’s pass to assist Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes caressed the ball as nonchalantly as David Beckham to put United 2-0 up against West Ham. He could have purely milked the acclaim yet made a beeline for Mainoo.",
      "This was the second time Mainoo walked off the MetLife Stadium pitch to murmurs of approval. As an 18-year-old two years ago, he outshone an Arsenal midfield of Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard. Erik ten Hag did not attend a post-match press conference but paused in the mixed zone to wax lyrical about Mainoo to us journalists.",
      "It was apparent that Ten Hag was preparing Mainoo not for the first team squad but the first team. Cruelly, 80 seconds into the friendly with Real Madrid in Houston the following week, Casemiro fouled Rodrygo, who collided into Mainoo’s ankle and he was sidelined for four months.",
      "Back in the United States for his second pre-season tour, Mainoo’s challenge is to regain his place rather than gain it. It augurs well that Amorim not only picked him from the start against West Ham but played Mainoo in midfield, his natural habitat.",
      "Mainoo has occupied three different roles in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system but it is in his and the team’s interests that he returns to midfield. United have a surfeit of possible No.10s - Matheus Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee. They have a shortage of out-and-out central midfielders and Mainoo is one of four.",
      "“I liked Kobbie Mainoo’s game,” Amorim enthused at the MetLife. That was unprompted. He was especially pleased with how Mainoo and the domineering Manuel Ugarte upped the intensity after the drab draw with Leeds United seven days earlier. Both started on the bench in Sweden.",
      "Amorim lamented “the lack of pace” in midfield against Leeds. He picked Fernandes and Casemiro, players with a combined age of 63. That rotational team in Stockholm seemed to be solely about fitness. In New Jersey, United’s starting XI could feasibly line up against Arsenal at Old Trafford on August 17.",
      "\"I spoke about that against Leeds because I felt like everybody in the midfield, the pace was not there,\" Amorim explained. \"Today it was there. Manuel and Kobbie did that job.\"",
      "\"I like the mentality of us today,\" Matthijs de Ligt added. \"High pressing, a lot of intensity.\" Mainoo and Ugarte underpinned that.",
      "Of the outfield players, Mainoo was maybe the least assured of keeping his place. Bryan Mbeumo could muscle his way in, though he will not play until the third tour match against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. United only have one more friendly - at home to Fiorentina on August 9 - before Arsenal board their train to Manchester Piccadilly.",
      "2024-25 was not a season teeming with highlights for Mainoo but he excelled at Arsenal in the spirited FA Cup third round triumph. Arsenal will likely have Rice and Rodri’s heir, Martin Zubimendi, to pit against United’s midfield axis.",
      "Amorim leaned on Casemiro in the final months of last season, predominantly in the Europa League. Mainoo and Ugarte are better equipped to compete with Rice, Zubimendi and Fernandes’ opposite number, Martin Odegaard.",
      "It has gone quiet on the new contract front for Mainoo. He last scrawled his signature on United papers in February 2023 when he was still a teenager and had made two appearances. The deal was highly incentivised but his profile has expanded vastly since, so much so that Nike made a song-and-dance about his renewal last year, arranging for Mainoo to play in a five-a-side game at Venice Beach. United have to remunerate him.",
      "As much of a wrench as it would be for members of the academy to see Alejandro Garnacho depart after five years, Garnacho hails from Madrid, not Manchester. His arrogance was so apparent in the academy that it was inevitable he would not be a one-club man and one day angle for a return to the land of his birth.",
      "It is different with Mainoo. He is a Mancunian and a boyhood United fan. The era of the one-club is in danger of ending and United is the club that has to rail against that.",
      "It is not pure sentiment to safeguard Mainoo’s future. He was integral to United’s FA Youth Cup and FA Cup successes, two of their highlights this decade. His winner at Wembley is one of the great Cup final goals. Mainoo left Wembley that day looking like a schoolboy on a field trip, with his shirt tucked out and a bucket hat resting on his noggin.",
      "He didn’t stand still. Weeks later, Mainoo transformed England’s midfield in their run to the European Championship final. He would enhance most midfields.",
      "Some supporters will be nervous about Mainoo’s sellable asset status. Midfield is also an area where United want to strengthen, once they have made room. Selling Mainoo is a prospect they cannot entertain and, as insignificant as pre-season matches are, Mainoo’s selection against West Ham was somewhat significant.",
      "Whenever Mainoo started in the second half of last season, it was in domestic matches between European ties. Amorim is evidently willing to compromise now, bringing Mainoo back into the midfield fold, and there is not as much noise around him as there was with Scott McTominay last year. Fulham had submitted two offers for McTominay by late July 2024.",
      "Two years ago, Mainoo’s sudden prominence made United receptive to selling McTominay. The plans changed when Rodrygo ploughed into Mainoo’s ankle. Hopefully, he avoids such misfortune in Chicago.",
      "Then he can continue to perfect his rhythm.",

      "Those who stayed up late to watch Manchester United's pre-season tour opener against West Ham United were probably pleased with their decision by the half-time break.",
      "United went into the interval at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey 1-0 up following Bruno Fernandes' early penalty. He confidently slotted the ball home after Alphonse Areola brought Ayden Heaven down inside the box.",
      "United's first half showing in New Jersey was encouraging. They were dominant for long spells of the opening 45 minutes and used the ball with purpose.",
      "They set a good tempo for just their second pre-season friendly of the summer, and the players offered plenty of evidence to suggest they are becoming more and more aligned with Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "Pre-season caveats have to be accounted for, but credit should be given where credit's due, and United played very well up until Amorim, as planned, made ten changes shortly after the hour mark, particularly in the first half.",
      "What was most striking about United's first half showing was the tempo they set. They were too slow and laboured against Leeds United in Stockholm the previous weekend, but they had stored another week's worth of training under their belts ahead of their Premier League Summer Series opener.",
      "Against Leeds, United were arguably better in the second half, following 11 changes at the break, and much of their good work stemmed from the flanks. Wing-backs are essential to making Amorim's system thrive and he is not without options in the wide areas.",
      "While Diogo Dalot, new signing Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will be competing for a starting berth on the right flank, Patrick Dorgu and summer signing Diego Leon will be competing on the other flank.",
      "Dorgu arrived from Lecce back in February, becoming United's first signing of the Amorim era, and cost them a base price of £25million. People who had studied Dorgu's time in Italy closely believed the Reds got a good deal amid the Dane's potential.",
      "Arriving in a new country and joining a club of United's stature where the expectation levels are through the roof, Dorgu was always going to need time to adapt, both on and off the pitch. It would have been naive to expect instant success.",
      "His task of hitting the ground running was made harder by the fact he walked into a team that was struggling and bereft of confidence. Patience had to be required.",
      "While pre-season games are rarely played at the same pace and with the same level of desire as competitive matches, Dorgu banked plenty of credit for his performance against West Ham.",
      "Starting in the left wing-back berth, he produced exactly the type of attacking runs that Amorim both wants and needs to see from his wing-backs. With the two playmakers occupying central positions, the onus is on the wing-backs to provide the width.",
      "The Dane regularly got high up the pitch, occupying attacking positions, and that will have pleased Amorim. The wing-backs are essentially wingers, given how much energy they have to produce.",
      "His bursts into attack-minded areas certainly gave West Ham plenty to think about, with the Dane regularly providing an option on the left flank. He was the target for a couple of excellent cross-field balls from Leny Yoro.",
      "While it is important to remain grounded after just two pre-season outings, Dorgu's performances in the last two games have been encouraging. He is one of several players who ought to benefit from a full pre-season this summer.",
      "United are not thought to be targeting another left-sided signing this summer, meaning the Dane is primed to remain Amorim's first-choice wing-back on the left flank. That was always the plan when he arrived at Old Trafford earlier this year.",
      "With pre-season having started well for the wing-back, he will have ambitions of maintaining his upward trajectory ahead of the season opener against Arsenal next month. His first two performances of the summer have offered enough to suggest he could be as good as a new signing for Amorim.",

      "Manchester United have been credited with holding talks with RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko's representatives about a possible move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to Sky Germany, United, alongside Premier League counterparts Newcastle United, are 'currently in talks' about the possibility of luring him to the Premier League before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "United are desperate to recruit a centre-forward this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "They have already bolstered their attack with the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "Signing a reliable striker is essential for United this summer and reports linking them with Sesko have resurfaced once again. The RB Leipzig forward is one of the most exciting strikers in Europe and scored a respectable 21 goals across all competitions last season.",
      "As documented, Newcastle are also said to be interested in signing the Slovenian international, 22, amid the increasing likelihood they will be lose Alexander Isak this summer. The Magpies marksman is currently being heavily linked with Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "With Newcastle set to be left with no choice to try and find a replacement, it has been claimed Sesko has made his way onto their radar, meaning United have stiff competition to try and secure his signature. Furthermore, Leipzig are yet to have received a formal bid from either club.",
      "Sesko, who was on United's radar in 2022, has been no stranger to transfer speculation in recent months, prompting his agent, Elvis Basanovic, to outline what he and his client will be looking for in a new club.",
      "He said: \"It's not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko but maybe it is right to clarify a few things. Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It's him vs him every day.",
      "\"We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn't affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers.",
      "\"That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club. A special project with a special coach.\"",
      "United, this summer, are embarking on what they hope will be a long and successful marriage with head coach Ruben Amorim, meaning they have high hopes the Portuguese chief will oversee a sharp improvement in the coming years.",
      "After attempting to find his feet at Old Trafford last season, following his mid-season appointment, Amorim has essentially been able to start with a clean slate this summer ahead of his first full season at the helm.",

      "Fernandes' impact was obvious, while the performance of new signing Matheus Cunha was encouraging. Kobbie Mainoo looked bright, too, but Amorim may have been happiest about the performance of a player he had worked with prior to joining United.",
      "It is fair to say the jury is still out on Manuel Ugarte after his first season at the club.",
      "The Uruguayan international joined United from PSG in a deal worth £50million but was largely inconsistent in his first season in England.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "The 24-year-old worked under Amorim at Sporting CP before moving to the French capital and his performances in Lisbon convinced les Parisiens to make their move.",
      "Ugarte established himself as one of the brightest young midfielders in Europe while playing under Amorim and the pair won a Portuguese League Cup together.",
      "As Amorim heads into his first full season in charge of United after some difficulties last term, he will hope Ugarte can be one of the players who can drive standards and establish his ideas in the dressing room.",
      "So his performance against West Ham last night would have encouraged Amorim, particularly how well he played alongside Mainoo at the base of midfield.",
      "One moment, particularly, suggested Ugarte was on song and would have pleased his manager heading into the new season.",
      "With United 1-0 up in the first half, Ugarte flew into a challenge with Guido Rodriguez when a loose ball presented itself in the West Ham half. He then nutmegged James Ward-Prowse before sliding a deft pass through to Amad.",
      "The Ivorian buried his effort past Alphonse Areola and although the goal was ruled out for offside, that one passage of play showed Ugarte at his best.",
      "After a mixed first season, if Ugarte can consistently show those qualities this term United may finally experience the benefits his £50million transfer was supposed to bring.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, July 28.",
      "United were in action over the weekend, with Ruben Amorim's side starting their Premier League Summer Series endeavours with a 2-1 win over West Ham United. Captain Bruno Fernandes scored a brace before Jarrod Bowen pegged one back in the United States to maintain the Reds' unbeaten pre-season.",
      "Attention now turns back to the transfer window and two names that were in the headlines over the weekend were Benjamin Sesko and Gianluigi Donnarumma. Sesko is the latest striker linked with a move to Old Trafford, while Donnarumma's contract situation at PSG has left United on high alert.",
      "There's also the potential for some high-profile exits with Antony now close to securing a move to Saudi Arabia. Al Nassr are said to be the frontrunners to land the Brazilian.",
      "Take a look at all the United transfer news and views as we get it below.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly being watched closely by those at AC Milan.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim that Milan are searching for a striker who will provide competition with Santiago Gimenez.",
      "Hojlund is said to fit the bill, with Darwin Nunez and Juve star Dusan Vlahovic also of interest.",
      "“Rasmus Højlund also remains of interest. His agent recently offered him to Milan, although it’s Manchester United who would need to agree to a loan with an option to buy.”",
      "Manchester United have begun background talks with RB Leipzig over a proposed move for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Fabrizio Romano expressed that on Monday, United's hierarchy opened up conversations about trying to beat Newcastle United to his signature. In a video uploaded to YouTube, he said:",
      "Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko's camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision. So Man United are starting to move, Newcastle have already presented their project and are prepared to match the financial request.",
      "Any deal is seen as slightly complicated due to the finances involved, given the Red Devils still need to seek exits for the likes of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "His price remains set at £60-70m this summer, with add-ons perhaps taking a deal closer to the £80m mark.",
      "Following the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha already this summer, United's next task is to try and find a striker.",
      "They are desperate to secure a new No.9 this summer and they have been linked with countless names in recent weeks and months.",
      "But after signing two Premier League proven attackers to strengthen their No.10 options, it would be no surprise if United followed suit in their search for a natural No.9.",
      "Liam Delap was attainable via a £30million release clause but ended up at Chelsea, meaning that has forced United to look elsewhere for a goal-getter.",
      "In truth, there are a limited number of Premier League strikers United could realistically try and sign before the end of the window, and even then sales remain vitally important. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa and Crystal Palace ace Jean-Philippe Mateta are probably the two most attractive options right now.",
      "Nevertheless, the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha show that United want players with Premier League pedigree.",
      "United are being linked with a move for Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "Evening Standard says the 26-year-old PSG man would be available for permanent transfer this summer.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is a name that simply will not go away this summer.",
      "The RB Leipzig forward has been linked with United, Newcastle and Arsenal, and his future is still not set in stone.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants a new number nine and appears to be waiting for further outgoings before sanctioning his next addition.",
      "TBR Football have today stated that Sesko would 'prefer' a move to Old Trafford over one to Newcastle.",
      "It remains to be seen, for now, whether the talented Slovenian ends up.",
      "Another one you may have missed over the weekend is the story linking United with Aleksandar Mitrovic.",
      "Caught Offside have claimed that the Reds are planning a surprise move for the striker. He has scored 68 goals in the last two seasons in Saudi Arabia and it's been said he would accept a pay cut to move to Old Trafford.",
      "A fee of £20m has been touted.",
      "Al Nassr have submitted an offer for Antony and it's understood that the Brazilian is open to a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "TeamTALK have claimed that United want £43.7m for Antony with negotiations ongoing to reach an agreement. Antony, however, has given a green light to complete the move.",
      "Man United have reportedly made their first move to sign Sporting CP midfielder Morten Hjulmand.",
      "Calciomercato.com has reported that an offer worth €40m (£34.8m) has been submitted in hope of securing his services ahead of Juventus. Hjulmand has a release clause worth €80m (£69.6m).",
      "Sporting are said to be open to offers of €50m (£43.5m) but Hjulmand's entourage are keen to finalise an exit for €30m/€40m (£26.1m-£34.8m).",
      "Randal Kolo Muani is set to be the subject of a bid from Man United in the coming days, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "Juventus are also said to be monitoring the situation after having the striker on loan last season. Kolo Muani scored eight goals in 16 Serie A appearances.",
      "You may have missed it over the weekend but Luke Shaw has been tipped with a shock move out of Man United.",
      "The Sun have claimed that the defender is willing to listen to offers from Saudi Arabia amid uncertainty over his playing time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "German journalist Guido Schafer has claimed that Benjamin Sesko is open to a move to Man United despite the club having no European football to offer.",
      "It's claimed that Sesko would rather sign for United than Newcastle.",
      "Man United are reportedly going head-to-head with Brentford to sign Metz teenager Idrissa Gueye.",
      "The youngster scored five goals in 17 appearances in Ligue 2 and is wanted by some Premier League sides. Brentford are thought to be ready to offer him first-team football.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United hold an interest in signing Donnarumma in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Italian is understood to be at a stalemate with PSG over a new contract and United have shortlisted him as an option to bolster their goalkeepers.",
      "It is claimed that Donnarumma is ready to explore his options and PSG could be willing to sell him this summer as he enters the final year of his contract.",
      "L’Equipe understands that PSG are looking to the future as they potentially hope to replace Donnarumma this summer.",
      "It is claimed that the French and European champions are eyeing a move for Lille’s promising shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier.",

      "According to our colleagues at Bristol Live, United's young goalkeeper Radek Vitek is set to leave the club.",
      "It is being reported that Vitek is of interest to Championship club Bristol City and the Robins are progressing with a deal.",

      "If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players. I know for a fact, these people, Omar, Jason and the club, have a number for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand that clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition. If you want to play in the World Cup next year you need to play.",

      "According to Brazilian outlet Antenados, Antony has rejected two offers to return to his home country this summer.",

      "Last season, the relationship between Watkins and Villa became testy when the forward was dropped in favour of United loanee Rashford.",
      "After making his return to the starting line-up, Watkins made his feelings clear.",
      "He's the manager at the end of the day and you've got to respect his decision, but I'm not one of those players that's happy to sit on the bench. I was fuming I wasn't playing and I let him know that.",
      "While MEN Sport understands that United have not made a formal offer for Watkins yet, it appears that the Reds will have competition to complete a move for him.",
      "The Daily Mail understands Newcastle have the Villa man on their watchlist this summer amid concerns that Isak could now leave them.",
      "We understand that Villa remain adamant that Watkins will not leave them this summer.",
      "United could be about to set off an entire transfer merry-go-round this summer in their bid to sign a new striker.",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport, understand that if United, or another club, pip Juventus to the signing of Kolo Muani they will turn their attention to Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "It is thought the Turin club would want to sign the Dane on loan to strengthen their attack.",
      "Elaborating further on the links to Randal Kolo Muani, ESPN adds that PSG no longer want the forward after loaning him to Juventus for the second half of last season.",
      "Juve would want him back but currently are not in a position to afford him.",
      "The Frenchman has been offered to Premier League clubs. Chelsea are understood to have looked at him but preferred Delap and Pedro, Arsenal always wanted Gyokeres so it seems that United could be at the front of the queue potentially with Newcastle.",
      "Speaking earlier this summer, Sesko's agent Elvis Basanovic explained what clubs like United would need to do to convince his client to leave RB Leipzig.",
      "It’s not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko, but maybe it is right to clarify a few things. Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It’s him vs. him every day. We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn’t affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers. That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club — a special project with a special coach.",
      "According to ESPN, there are three strikers currently on United's radar as they look to bolster their attack.",
      "Watkins, Kolo-Muani and Vlahovic are thought to be on the Reds' watchlist.",
      "However, it is also understood that United will have to sell a striker for one to come in with all eyes being on either Hojlund or Zirkzee to make way.",
      "L’Equipe understands that PSG are looking to the future as they potentially hope to replace Donnarumma this summer.",
      "It is claimed that the French and European champions are eyeing a move for Lille’s promising shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier.",
      "He would likely come in as PSG's new starter and there is a feeling that Chevalier could be the club's first choice even if Donnarumma decides to stay.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United hold an interest in signing Donnarumma in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Italian is understood to be at a stalemate with PSG over a new contract and United have shortlisted him as an option to bolster their goalkeepers.",
      "It is claimed that Donnarumma is ready to explore his options and PSG could be willing to sell him this summer as he enters the final year of his contract."

      "Manchester United have reportedly made their first attempt to try and sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been heavily linked with signing Sesko this summer as they look to bring in a new centre forward. Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are United's current striker options but there are rumours that the club will look to bring in reinforcements before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have both already been signed by United this summer. Sesko's future has been the subject of speculation for some time, with Arsenal and Newcastle being linked with a move for the Slovenia international over the last few weeks.",
      "Now a fresh update has emerged which concerns United's chances of signing Sesko. Journalist Fabrizio Romano has reported that United have made contact with Sesko's representatives with a view to potentially signing the striker this summer.",
      "It has been claimed that United are yet to approach Sesko himself or Leipzig, but that there is definite interest from the Reds to get a deal over the line.",
      "Romano has claimed on his latest YouTube video that United are set to battle Newcastle for Sesko's signature, with the Magpies also approaching the striker over a potential deal.",
      "There is no indication yet of which destination Sesko would prefer at this moment in time, although it's hinted that United have a good chance of completing a deal if a fee can be agreed.",
      "\"I maintain my position,\" Romano said. \"It is going to be a very important week because Newcastle have presented their project to the player's side. Because Newcastle are attacking, so they are prepared to make a big proposal financially to the player and a big proposal financially also to RB Leipzig, obviously with this Isak story ongoing with Liverpool.",
      "\"For Sesko, Newcastle are ready to make something big but don't forget also Man United. Man United have been discussing internally for days about strikers - Ollie Watkins but Aston Villa insist on keeping the player...Sesko but obviously financially it is not an easy deal.",
      "\"But Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko's camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision.",
      "\"So Man United are starting to move, Newcastle have already presented their project and are prepared to match the financial request. So Newcastle are ready to make a very important proposal to Sesko and Leipzig. Man United have started the concrete conversation while they discussed his name internally for weeks.",
      "\"So keep an eye on this Sesko story because in the next hours, days, we will understand more or what Sesko wants to do and so what is going to happen. For Sesko, there is a gentleman's agreement between the player, the agent and RB Leipzig, a very good relationship.",
      "\"If the player tells Leipzig 'there is a club I consider special' there is a gentleman's agreement to make the price drop to €70-80 million. So €70-80m... let's say this is the range and then €5-10m in add ons, so this could be the package for Sesko, a gentleman's agreement if the player wants.",
      "\"So keep an eye on this one, because Newcastle made already a big project proposal - and financial proposal is ready - and Man United made contact to be informed of the situation. Let's see what is going to happen.\"",
      "Sesko is reported to be valued at around €80million (£69.4million), which would include add-ons if a deal was to be agreed.",

      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens has described Manchester United as \"one of the best clubs\" amid ongoing speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "After Andre Onana committed one too many high profile errors last season, United are in the market for a new goalkeeper this summer, and reports linking them with Lammens have been consistent of late.",
      "The Belgian, 23, was linked with United earlier this year and admitted at the time he would find it difficult to turn down a move to Old Trafford. He has been at Antwerp since June 2023.",
      "The shot-stopper started Antwerp's season opener against Union Saint-Gilloise on Friday and was asked about his future and the speculation linking him with a move to United.",
      "\"Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" Lammens said, as quoted by Sport Witness. \"But you never know.",
      "\"It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here. In any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you've earned it.\"",
      "Although he is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury, Onana is of the understanding he will remain United's first-choice goalkeeper this season. He has no plans to leave the club unless United decided they want to sell him.",
      "Despite that, Lammens has suggested he is prepared to leave Antwerp without the guarantee of a regular starting place at his next club, but insists a pathway for him to become a future starter must be in place.",
      "He added: \"I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place.",
      "\"Ideally, that means playing immediately, but it's also possible I'll have to take a step in between. As long as there's a plan, it doesn't matter whether I'm ready for the next step or not.",

      "Marcus Rashford endured one of the most embarrassing moments a professional footballer can face on Sunday.",
      "The Manchester United forward secured his dream loan move to Barcelona last week as he looks to revive his faltering career. The deal, which was completed in time for Rashford to travel to Japan alongside the rest of the Barcelona squad, provides the La Liga champions with an option to purchase him for £26million next summer.",
      "Rashford's first pre-season appearance came against Japanese side Vissel Kobe, where he began the match on the substitutes' bench. Hansi Flick introduced the 27-year-old for his eagerly-awaited debut at the half-time break, with Rashford displaying flashes of quality and commitment to his defensive duties in his new Blaugrana colours.",
      "However, he was quickly brought back down to earth as manager Flick withdrew him after just 33 minutes, right after he had played a key role in Barcelona's second goal. Rashford and left-back Jofre Torrents were replaced by Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, with the latter going on to score Barca's third.",
      "While the substitution would have wounded Rashford's pride, Flick explained that his decision wasn't performance-based, saying: \"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury.\"",
      "Only seven days earlier, Rashford had been amongst United's 'bomb squad' – a group of players training in isolation and permitted to use the club's Carrington training facility only after the first-team squad had gone home.",
      "One player who understands how Rashford would have felt this weekend is former Tottenham midfielder Hossam Ghaly. Ghaly joined Spurs in 2006 and was used sporadically by then-manager Martin Jol throughout the 2006/07 campaign.",
      "After being in and out of the team, the Egyptian was introduced against Blackburn Rovers during the first half of the penultimate Premier League game of the season, after Steed Malbranque suffered an injury. But similarly to Rashford, he found himself taken off just 31 minutes into his entrance – only his substitution was due to a poor performance.",
      "In contrast to Rashford, however, Ghaly reacted in the worst manner possible, angrily hurling his shirt onto the floor while leaving the field. The gesture angered the Spurs supporters as boos and chants of \"You're not fit to wear the shirt\" echoed around the ground.",
      "Ghaly faced disciplinary action from the club and was left out of the matchday squad for the final game of the season, before issuing a public apology. He said: \"I am just so angry with myself. I have always considered it an honour to wear the Tottenham shirt and I never intended to show any disrespect.",
      "\"I knew things weren't happening for me out there, my play was terrible and I could hear the crowd jeering me. I was so upset at the fans' reaction. I have enjoyed playing in front of the club's supporters all season and I felt I had given my best all the time and played some decent football.",
      "\"It is always hard to accept being substituted after such a short period of time and I was upset and taken aback by the cheering. I am a player who plays with my heart.",
      "\"I know my reaction was totally wrong,\" he went on to say. \"I have apologised to the manager and I also want to apologise to the fans. I hope they don't judge me on this incident alone. I have tried hard for the club this season.\"",
      "Despite his attempts at making amends, that proved to be Ghaly's final appearance for Spurs as he was loaned out to Derby County in January 2008. He returned to north London for the 2008/09 campaign but failed to appear in a single match before leaving permanently.",
      "Harry Redknapp contemplated introducing him during a January 2009 clash with Wigan, but the English manager thought better of it after hearing the supporters jeer Ghaly while he warmed up and prepared to come on off the bench.",
      "Rashford will be keen to steer clear of a similar fate at Barcelona, while also hoping that Flick doesn't make a habit of exposing him to public embarrassment. The England star has endured his share of falling outs with United bosses Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim in recent times.",

      "Rashford was given his first run-out for the Catalan giants against Japanese side Vissel Kobe on Sunday. He came on at half-time and lasted 33 minutes before Hansi Flick took him off, a decision based on his lack of pre-season training prior to the game.",
      "\"He's week behind the others,\" he said. \"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes were fantastic. After that we lost a bit of control, but the second half was also very good. I'm pleased. What they do with the ball, how they pressed us, it’s really interesting. You can tell they have a clear idea, and it’s similar to ours.\"",
      "Barcelona play FC Seoul and Daegu FC in South Korea before returning to Spain to conclude their pre-season. After winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey and Supercopa de Espana last term, Blaugrana are looking to retain their titles as well as win the Champions League.",
      "Rashford goes into a team littered with talent. Joining the United loanee in attack is Robert Lewandoski, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Roony Bardghji. There's not many teams in Europe who boast a forward line with that many options.",
      "That being said, the United academy graduate must also up his game if he wants to secure a permanent move away from his boyhood club next summer. Barcelona have the option to make the deal a permanent one, but the England international knows he has to perform near his best.",
      "The deal in general is quite a bizarre one. Not often in football does a club on the back of their worst season in 51 years let a talented senior player leave, on loan, one of Europe's best. For Rashford, it's a superb deal but for United, it could be a harsh reality.",
      "Looking at the player's situation, there's more chance of it being a success than not. Should he help Barcelona retain their league title and compete in Europe while also recording impressive statistics on an individual level. The reality is, he's gone from playing in an under-performing United team to being shunned out, made to play elsewhere, to now being at one of Europe's best.",
      "For United, there was no other choice. They had to sanction his exit. But if Rashford proves himself in Spain, they will be left red-faced, especially when you consider all eyes are on which striker will be brought in to help Ruben Amorim's side.",

      "Mbeumo will line up alongside fellow new-boy Matheus Cunha, after the former Wolves man made his debut against Leeds in the summer's opening pre-season friendly.",
      "While there's plenty to look forward to on the field, as is so often the case on pre-season tours, it's the off-the-field action that could prove to be the most fascinating aspect of the trip to the US.",
      "United are still on the hunt for a striker and number of players still need to be offloaded. Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona has been confirmed but wantaway quartet Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are still on the club's books. Progress needs to be made in the coming weeks.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt insists Manchester United owe their supporters a successful season after a catastrophic 2024-25 campaign.",
      "United ended last term trophyless and 15th in the Premier League to officially mark their worst season since the club was relegated in 1974.",
      "Club figures are targeting a top-six finish in the upcoming season and United made a positive start to their pre-season tour of the United States with an enterprising 2-1 win against West Ham United in New Jersey.",
      "United take on Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday and Everton in Atlanta next Sunday before their final friendly against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim apologised to the supporters on the final day of last season and admitted it had been a \"disastrous\" campaign, but reminded them \"if there is one club in the world that has proven in the past it can overcome any situation, any disaster, it is our club. It is Manchester United Football Club.\"",
      "\"Of course we owe it to them,\" De Ligt stressed, referring to the supporters. \"But I think, first of all, we owe it to ourselves. I mean, we are all unhappy with our performances last season. So that's the first thing we have to do.",
      "\"We owe it also to ourselves to play much better. And then, obviously, the fans are the most important thing also. So hopefully we can give them a lot more joy this season.",
      "\"I don't think it will be difficult (to move on from last season) because, as you said, last season is last season. New season [is a] new season. Like I said, there's a lot of positivity now in the camp. Also, some new players. We have a lot of time to train now. So that aspect is really, really important now.",
      "\"I think after a season like that, it's normal to have to build your confidence. So that's why I think a win like today is really important. I think with winning, you become more confident. You start to believe more in what you're doing.",
      "\"Today was a good example of what we can show. And hopefully with this, the group becomes even better. These games are really important for us to win. So we can build on this.\"",
      "De Ligt also acknowledged the absence of European football could be a benefit for United. \"I think if you use the time well, it can definitely be an advantage. Obviously, as a football player, you want to play as much as possible. So it's a shame we are not in Europe.",
      "\"But I think if you saw the last season, also in the Premier League, some teams in the Champions League had a difficult season in the Premier League. So I think if we use the time well, if we train every day at maximum, we can make it our advantage.\"",
      "De Ligt started in the middle of a back three with Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven either side of him against West Ham. The majority of the starters could feasibly line up against Arsenal in three weeks, although Amorim downplayed the strength of the United side at his post-match press conference.",
      "United were deserving of victory against West Ham as Amorim kept the starting XI on for 65 minutes and De Ligt was encouraged by their start to the tour.",
      "\"Obviously we've been here already with [Amorim] for eight months, more or less,\" he added. \"Last season was not good enough, we know that. And now we have to find a way to improve.",
      "\"I think we've made some good signings already. You saw today already, Matheus (Cunha), he can bring a lot to the team. I like the mentality of us today, high pressing, a lot of intensity. Some chances also. I think we defended also quite well.",
      "\"So overall, I think it was a good performance.\"",

      "Following the win in Asia, Barcelona posted a statement in regard to their live stream of the friendly. It read: \"The club apologises for inconvenience caused during the broadcast of the game against Vissel Kobe.",

      "On Saturday, Kobbie Mainoo returned to the stadium where he announced himself to the world.",
      "Mainoo was just 18 when he started against Arsenal at the MetLife Stadium in July 2023, and that summer preceded an outstanding breakout campaign for the Stockport-born midfielder.",
      "During that tour of the United States, it was obvious Manchester United had a supremely talented young player on their hands. Mainoo looked unfazed playing in front of 82,500 fans and his laid-back nature endeared him to Erik ten Hag, who had no qualms about playing him in the Premier League.",
      "Mainoo was rewarded with a place at Euro 2024 for his performances during his first full season, but his second year as a first-team player didn't go as planned and the new campaign feels big for him.",
      "The 20-year-old has not consolidated himself in Ruben Amorim's preferred starting XI, partly because of injuries and partly because Amorim doesn't seem to know his best position.",
      "Mainoo has played as a No.10, a striker and in deeper midfield in Amorim's system. That hasn't been conducive to Mainoo showing his best form, but Amorim appears to be close to settling on his role this summer.",
      "The youngster came on from the bench against Leeds in Stockholm to play in the pivot and subsequently started in that role against West Ham. Mainoo was excellent against Arsenal at MetLife Stadium in 2023 and was hoping to deliver a similar display at the scene where the world recognised his potential.",
      "Some believe Mainoo does not possess the athleticism to operate in central midfield, but there were promising signs against Leeds and further positives to build on against the Hammers.",
      "Mainoo's range of passing isn't utilised when he plays as a No.10. However, when he starts in the deeper role, he can play like an NFL quarterback, orchestrating play and picking passes to start attacks.",
      "Amorim needs to settle on a role for Mainoo because it's impossible for him to find his rhythm when his position is changed each week, and the 40-year-old has admitted Mainoo needs to be close to the ball.",
      "Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: \"I think he can play in both positions, in the midfield. Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball.",
      "\"I think he is a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. I think he needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I'm always on top of that with Kobbie, because he is so good sometimes but he can be better. So I have big plans. But again, like I said, one game per week, the competition is going to be huge.\"",
      "Amorim made wholesale changes on the 65-minute mark and Mainoo was brought off. It's fair to say he didn't dazzle as he did against Arsenal 24 months ago, but that performance was a high benchmark.",
      "The question is whether Mainoo can be as effective in Amorim's system as he was when Ten Hag was in charge. Amorim is trying to fit Mainoo into his plans because he is too talented to leave on the bench.",
      "The remaining pre-season fixtures will provide further clues on Amorim's thinking, but it seems he is leaning towards the conclusion that Mainoo is best suited to playing in midfield.",
      "Provided Amorim can get the best out of Mainoo, he could be like a new signing.",

The opening could come from Newcastle, who are planning to make an initial offer of around €73 million to snatch him from RB Leipzig. The German club knows they will be attacked for their player before the end of the transfer window.”",

      "“We have ridden our luck, but I don’t think we were lucky.”",
      "It’s quite hard, we imagine based on absolutely no personal experience whatsoever, to speak with any great eloquence in the immediate aftermath of achieving something absurdly enormous. But we reckon Leah Williamson has come up with something quite wonderful here after England’s Euro 2025 triumph.",
      "Williamson, who genuinely might already have been the most Spoke Well, I Thought figure in women’s football, repeated the trick later in the same interview with a similar bait-and-switch: “Total disbelief, but at the same time I knew it was going to happen.”",
      "Both those statements appear to contain an unsolvable paradox, yet both in fact contain an essential truth about football, sport and – if you want to be a truly insufferable tagnut of a wanker about it – life itself.",
      "That second quote is really just a variation on the classic ‘name on the cup’ trope. Very obviously, no team’s name is ever on the cup. There is no such thing as destiny. No tournament is pre-ordained. But that doesn’t mean that the feeling of it being so is of no value or consequence.",
      "It can become self-fulfilling. It seems perfectly accurate to say that a huge part of England somehow winning this tournament boils down to England simply believing – knowing, on some level – they would do so. The sheer refusal to accept defeat is a huge part of the reason a team that led for one minute of the 360 minutes of knockout football they played in Switzerland was able to walk away with the prize.",
      "It’s that quote about luck that really grabbed us, though. We’d never really given much thought to the semantic difference between a team having luck and a team riding their luck. But when Williamson said it, we had some kind of eureka moment. Because it’s exactly and entirely correct.",
      "If you’re the sort of person who goes through life without a tinfoil hat on your head, then even giving a moment’s cursory thought to the idea of some teams or some players being intrinsically luckier than others is palpably absurd. It’s just such a childish notion when you think about it at all.",
      "Which is not at all to say luck does not exist, or play a large part in football. Of course it does. But it’s not ever what matters, not really, not by itself. And it’s not really what we’re saying, if we’re all honest with ourselves, when we say a team is ‘lucky’.",
      "Sheer dumb luck is probably more of a factor in sport (and, again, everything else) than any of us would care to admit. But the point isn’t that you had good luck; it’s that you capitalised upon it.",
      "England rode their luck in Switzerland. Again and again. To an almost ludicrous extreme. But what they did with that luck is what counts, what separates them from the rest.",
      "England’s desire, heart, determination, bottle, skill, talent and everything else helped them take the bits of luck that went their way and extract the absolute maximum possible. And like Williamson, we’re not at all prepared to write that off as just an accident. As itself just more good luck.",
      "And once you start down this road, you realise that distinction Williams draws between ‘luck’ and ‘riding your luck’ explains almost everything. There’s hints here of the classic ‘the more I practise, the luckier I get’.",
      "It’s about positioning yourself to be able to capitalise on those moments of fortune that come your way. To be remembered as a lucky side is really just to be remembered as one that made the most of that good fortune.",
      "Who remembers the lucky side that finished third? Absolutely nobody. Nobody is remembering lucky also-rans. Everyone remembers the lucky winners.",
      "When Manchester United were winning every trophy in sight under Sir Alex Ferguson, you’d hear this all the time. Lucky United. Another decision going their way.",
      "But while there may well be plenty of validity in the idea that United and big clubs in general get more decisions, what United under Ferguson were indisputably the best at was making any such good fortune count. Riding that luck.",
      "You see it still, now, with the more out-there of Online Arsenal Fans and their conspiracy-addled nudge-nudge wink-wink asides about the decisions that have gone Manchester City’s way, or Liverpool’s way, or PSG’s way or whatever.",
      "But of course those teams had luck go their way. You know which teams have a bit of luck going their way sometimes? All the teams. Absolutely every one of them. But one fairly obvious difference between the teams that win and the teams that finish second again is that the teams that win have made those moments of good fortune count more often.",
      "We’d suggest that the idea of a team being ‘lucky’ is rarely made in good faith, that whatever – if any – evidence that purports to support the position has been cherrypicked or manipulated. It is, by definition a glib and simplistic narrative designed not just to denigrate the target but to absolve you or your team from responsibility.",
      "It was the referees. It was that ricochet. It was that deflection. It was the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself. It was luck. It was, therefore, Not Our Fault. Being expected to compete against the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself is even more absurd than expecting a team to compete with 115 Charges FC.",
      "But Williamson has got to the heart of it. The lucky teams aren’t the ones that have more luck; they are the ones who make damn sure they make that luck more significant, more memorable. The ones that make it count for something.",
      "Maybe it is better to be lucky than good, but any amount of the former will get you nowhere without a healthy dose of the latter."

The Serie A champions remain intent on signing Dan Ndoye from Bologna but if Forest win that race then Antonio Conte is quite willing to sanction a move for Sterling. Jack Grealish is also a possibility for Napoli.",

      "17) Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "16) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "14) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Nothing on Isak, mind…",
      "",
      "",
      "11) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "10) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted.",
      "",
      "7) 🆕 Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",

      "4)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle are trying to fight what feels like the inevitable and we should see something in the way of an offer from Liverpool this week. We can be almost certain the first bid will fail, but when the player is as keen to move as Isak reportedly is, the Toon are fighting the tide. The Swede just needs to hope that Liverpool’s desire matches his own.",
      "3) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nLiverpool let on that Diaz wasn’t for sale, for the player wanted to leave and Bayern have compromised on their initial valuation. A fee of £65million has been agreed so that the Colombian can travel to Bavaria for a medical. There’s half the Isak money…",
      "",
      "2)🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect. A medical is due to begin on Monday.",

      "Man Utd are set to discuss a potential deal to sign Benjamin Sesko in a meeting with Ruben Amorim next week, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Red Devils have already completed the attacking signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has also joined.",
      "Man Utd are still looking to make at least three more signings, according to reports, with a centre-forward, defensive midfielder and goalkeeper on their list of priorities.",
      "RB Leipzig’s Sesko and Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins have emerged as two of the most mentioned options to improve their attack but it is currently unclear who they will make a concrete move for.",
      "And transfer expert Romano has revealed that Man Utd “will discuss” a potential move for Sesko next week with Amorim as a deal could become “expensive”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Next week will be important, very important for the future of Benjamin Sesko. Newcastle are going very big with a contract proposal ready for the player and they are also ready to approach RB Leipzig. Newcastle are going very strong and are prepared to make important things happen for the Slovenian striker. They will go big next week.",
      "READ: Manchester United keep or sell: Amorim to offload Hojlund alongside Garnacho, Sancho, Antony",
      "“Manchester United are still discussing Benjamin Sesko internally. It is an expensive deal, so it is not easy, but don’t forget the gentleman’s agreement I told you. For some clubs, indicated by Benjamin Sesko as ‘special clubs’ for him, the price of the package can be €70m to €80m fixed, €5m to €10m in add-ons. It can be an important factor.",
      "“With Newcastle going very big and Manchester United discussing strikers and Sesko internally. Keep an eye on this story in the next week, in the next days. Newcastle will go with a big proposal, Manchester United will discuss his name again with the coach involved in the conversation, with the directors to see if they can make it happen or not.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils would be better off with a more experienced striker than Sesko after their struggles with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Ferdinand explained on his YouTube channel: “I think you’ve got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man Utd. That’s what I said about a number nine. I’m not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I’m saying Man Utd need experience at the top of the pitch.",
      "“They’ve got Hojlund, they’ve got Zirkzee, they’ve got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go, ‘That’s how you play as a number nine.’ That’s how you do it. When you’re going to buy somebody who hasn’t got as much experience as I’d like, I think that’s another risk. Is it worth taking with inexperienced players at this level?”",
      "After taking Mbuemo off Brentford’s hands in the summer, The Sun now claim that Man Utd could ‘hijack’ the Bees’ deal to sign young Metz forward Idrissa Gueye.",
      "Man Utd and Burnley have now ‘joined the hunt’ for the 18-year-old with the competition forcing Brentford to ‘now look at matching his French club’s £15m asking price’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Brentford can offer Gueye a chance at early Premier League football, while United only see him as a long-term project.’",
      "Man Utd face a potential knockout blow in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle are the ‘most serious’ contenders, according to reports.",

      "Romano said on YouTube earlier this week: “In the recent hours [Man United] had direct contact with Aston Villa. There was a club to club conversation – Man United asked about the situation of Ollie Watkins, the answer from Aston Villa is that they want to keep the player.",

      "It’s supposed to be a summer of change for Manchester United after finishing 2024/25 trophyless and 15th in the Premier League. They’ve signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but are struggling to shift the deadweight.",
      "With that in mind, we’ve analysed the entire first-team squad at Old Trafford and decided who should be kept, sold, or loaned out before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "You can read our recent Arsenal keep or sell here.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana: Sell\nManchester United are reportedly open to selling Onana after another unconvincing campaign, but the Cameroonian wants to stay. Why wouldn’t he? He’s under contract at a Premier League club for another three years, earns £200,000 a week, and is 30 next year. Sure, he could get a fat(ter) wage in the Middle East, but he’s comfortable and knows there’s no chance he’ll lose his spot in goal if he stays.",
      "The Red Devils have bigger priorities with a smaller budget than desired and need to sell attackers before buying a new striker, unless they cheap out and go for Jamie Vardy or Dominic Calvert-Lewin. As alluded to, they’d need to sell Onana to sign a new goalkeeper, which would be the ideal scenario, because the ex-Ajax ‘keeper hasn’t been good enough.",
      "",
      "Altay Bayindir: Sell\nErik ten Hag did everything in his power not to play Bayindir when he was in charge, asking Onana to travel for the African Cup of Nations straight after playing against Tottenham Hotspur at one point.",
      "It turns out Ten Hag had very good reason for doing so. It’s for the best that the Turkish goalkeeper moves on this summer.",
      "",
      "Tom Heaton: Keep\nIf United want to be a serious club again, they can’t let a young talent like Heaton go.",
      "",
      "Diogo Dalot: Keep\nDalot’s versatility makes him an important player. He can play on either side and as one of Ruben Amorim’s three centre-backs. Despite being unconvincing so far under his compatriot, we don’t think it’s right to sell the Portugal defender.",
      "",
      "Matthijs de Ligt: Keep\nDe Ligt was fairly consistent in his first year at Old Trafford. There were a few blunders, but all in all, he’s been decent.",
      "",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Keep\nOnly signed in January, Dorgu obviously won’t leave in the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Tyler Fredricson: Loan\nWith no European football to contend with, Amorim might want to loan out a few of his promising young players, including Fredricson. The 20-year-old defender played twice in the Premier League last term, with both matches three days after Thursday evening Europa League ties.",
      "",
      "Ayden Heaven: Keep\nLoaning Heaven wouldn’t be a bad idea, but his performances in a dysfunctional United team have been very promising. He didn’t play too often, but when he did, he arguably looked the most confident and talented player in Amorim’s defence. He could contribute next season, for sure.",

      "Lisandro Martinez: Keep\nBack after an unfortunate anterior cruciate ligament tear, which came after an injury-ravaged 2023/24 campaign, the Argentine suits playing left in a back three, and will be someone Amorim heavily relies on this season.",
      "",
      "Harry Maguire: Keep\nTruthfully, Maguire suits a back three well. He might earn a colossal £190,000 a week and be out of contract next year, but the lack of potential takers means losing him for nothing next year might be the way to go.",
      "",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Keep\nLike Dalot, Mazraoui’s versatility makes him an important player. And he actually played well for the majority of last season.",
      "",
      "Luke Shaw: Sell\nThere is reportedly interest from Saudi Arabia and United must be all over it. We all know about Shaw’s injury record, which should be enough reason to consider cashing in on their longest-serving player. Whether they get offered £5m or £25m, taking the opportunity to sell him is vital if it presents itself.",

      "",
      "Harry Amass: Loan\nKeeping Amass wouldn’t be the worst idea, especially if Shaw leaves, but a year of consistent first-team football could be huge for him. He’s a top talent and has the potential to be one of Europe’s leading wing-backs. United have to get his development right. So, in other words, he’s the next Brandon Williams.",

      "",
      "Casemiro: Sell\nUnited have been trying to sell Casemiro for what feels like an eternity, yet for some reason, reported interest from Saudi Arabia has never led to a formal bid.",
      "The Real Madrid legend was brilliant in his first season at Old Trafford, but his form took an almighty nose-dive at the beginning of 2023/24, which he didn’t really recover from until Amorim’s arrival last winter. He has been fine playing central midfield in the 3-4-2-1 system, but it’s still painfully obvious that United need to sell him.",
      "",
      "Toby Collyer: Loan\nThere are not enough minutes available for young Collyer with no European football for United, so a loan makes sense.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Keep\nThe captain carried United through the majority of last season. Without Bruno, there would have been no Europa League final run, and relegation might have been a real concern – if the bottom three hadn’t been so shockingly poor.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Keep\nUnited could alleviate some PSR concerns by selling Mainoo, and Chelsea and Spurs are two of the clubs linked with the 20-year-old England midfielder. It’s just not a good idea to sell him, though, is it?",
      "He’s one of the best players to come through the club’s youth academy in recent years and despite being off the pace for much of last season, he can be a brilliant player now and world-class in the future.",
      "",
      "Mason Mount: Keep\nClearly a very talented player, Mount’s career has been hampered by injuries, which have limited him to 19 starts for United in two years at the club.",
      "We reckon it’s a case of last-chance saloon at United for the 26-year-old. If he can prove his fitness and ability in 2025/26, then great. If not, next summer will be the time to cut ties.",
      "",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Keep\nUgarte hasn’t lived up to his £51m transfer fee yet, but he’s someone Amorim knows how to get the best out of. He’ll be better this season.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho: Sell\nThe first of seven attackers, Sancho is surplus to requirements after an average year on loan at Premier League rivals Chelsea. The Blues could’ve signed him permanently for £25m but preferred to pay a £5m penalty fee to send the 25-year-old back to Manchester.",
      "He returns to a team managed by Amorim, not Ten Hag, with whom he publicly fell out, but a change in manager isn’t enough to save his United career. Sancho’s best position might be in one of the wide 10 roles behind the striker, but it’s unlikely that he’ll get the chance to prove it.",
      "Juventus are the club most keen on signing Sancho this summer, but the winger’s salary is proving to be a huge stumbling block. There’s no doubt that he needs to take a wage cut if he wants to play regularly for any team in 2025/26.",
      "MORE: Marcus Rashford only second in sellability ranking of Man Utd bomb squad",
      "",
      "Antony: Sell\nDespite an outstanding six months on loan at Europa Conference League runners-up Real Betis, Antony doesn’t have a future at Old Trafford and is one of four currently ostracised as the club’s hierarchy desperately tries to sell them.",
      "His time in Spain was fruitful for him and United, who are delighted that the winger’s value has risen from around £15m to at least double that. Selling an £80m signing for £30m will be painful, but that’s still a helpful fee as the club’s centre-forward search goes on.",
      "",
      "Amad Diallo: Keep\nAnother rare bright spark in a rubbish United team last term.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho: Sell\nThe fourth and final ostracised player, Garnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and reportedly has interest from Aston Villa and obviously Chelsea. United want a huge £60m for the Argentine, which is wildly unrealistic. Regardless, head coach Amorim says the club will stand firm with their valuation, and if he isn’t sold, he’ll be welcomed back into the first team. Sure he will.",
      "Whatever the Red Devils receive for Garnacho will be deemed pure profit, which has become highly valued under current PSR rules. Despite what Amorim has said, we can see the 21-year-old leaving for closer to £45m at the end of August.",
      "",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: Loan\nTricky one, this. Loaning or selling Hojlund only makes sense if there’s enough time to sign a replacement after his departure, or if one has already been brought in.",
      "After a stellar 2022/23 campaign at Atalanta, there is interest from Serie A this summer, namely from Inter, who currently have Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram as their starting strikers.",
      "A buy option would surely be included in any deal, with an obligation unlikely unless it’s for a huge fee, like, say, £50m. After four Premier League goals last term, that’s never going to happen.",
      "He’s only 22, so selling now might come back to bite United on the arse. Giving him fresh surroundings for a year while Amorim and Ratcliffe try to clean an almighty mess could be perfect for Hojlund, who desperately needs confidence and a chance to prove he’s good enough to be United’s long-term No.9.",
      "",
      "Chido Obi: Keep\nThe lack of striker depth means Obi should stick around and get the occasional first-team opportunity.",
      "",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Keep\nThe last time we did one of these, it was keep Hojlund, sell Zirkzee. We’re not completely sure what’s changed our mind, but here we are.",
      "In fairness to the Dutchman, he’s slowly but surely improved after a poor start to life in England, with the pace of the league all a bit too much for him.",
      "There could be a Joelinton-style transformation for Zirkzee to become an excellent box-to-box midfielder. He also looks well suited to the wide 10 role. Up front, though? We’re not convinced.",

      "",
      "10) Juventus – £91.84m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Still, a report in Spain claims Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Robert Lewandowski have been ‘genuinely upset by Joan Laporta and Deco’s decision to sign him’.",

He won’t be travelling on the Asian tour, and his future was set to be with Valencia, but in the last few hours, everything has taken a radical turn, and he’s most likely moving to Portugal. More specifically, to Sporting Braga, who are willing to pay around €12 million for his signing.",
      "‘And Virgili soon received the first blow, after Flick decided to drop him after the first training sessions and didn’t call him up for the trip to Asia. It seems that RCD Mallorca will be the team that ends up recruiting the winger born in 2006 , who could follow Pablo Torre’s example.’",
      "Marcus Rashford is said to be a “very lucky boy” to leave Manchester United for Barcelona as a move to the Championship club would be more “logical”.",
      "Lamine Yamal reportedly feels he has been ‘deceived’ by Barcelona over the signing of Marcus Rashford, and is angry that he was not ‘involved’ in the transfer decision, like Lionel ...",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",

      "We take a look and wonder whether Liverpool or Newcastle might be interested, or maybe even Manchester United; they need a striker more than anybody.",
      "",
      "10) Kylian Mbappe (Real Madrid)\nWe start with a player obviously very attainable. A ridiculous player with ridiculous statistics. Didn’t help Real Madrid win any trophies last season though, did he?In all seriousness, Liverpool really did come relatively close to signing the Frenchman, who apparently agreed to join the Reds three years ago for £169m. But PSG wanted a world-record fee, just two years before losing him for nowt.",
      "And now Liverpool are briefing the media that they think they have signed a player with Mbappe-like potential in Ekitike. Even better than the real thing?",
      "",
      "9) Vinicius Jnr (Real Madrid)\nThis is why Real Madrid are not in the market for Isak; they already have two pretty good clones. And with the Brazilian’s price being in the £300m-plus bracket, the only suitors are likely to come from the Middle East. Remember when Vinicius being a target for Manchester United was briefly A Thing? Good times.",
      "",
      "8) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nWe took the pee out of Liverpool’s attempts to brush over the fact that the Frenchman has a poor goalscoring record but he was probably the very closest they could sign to Isak in terms of style, which will be handy if they don’t manage to sign the original too…",
      "",
      "7) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nNow this one really does make sense for Newcastle. He’s likely to be pushed down the Chelsea pecking order by Joao Pedro and Liam Delap and Manchester United have been strongly linked. But Newcastle can offer a) Champions League football and b) a style that suits Jackson rather more than the Pep-ball Lite at Stamford Bridge. All Chelsea need to do is stop pretending he is worth £80m and double their money at around £65m instead.",
      "",
      "6) Mateo Retegui (Al-Qadsiah)\nThe Italian striker has already taken the filthy lucre (over £50m over three years, according to reports) to leave Atalanta for Saudi Arabia, so it will be a hot year at least before he is looking for a transfer back to Europe.",
      "",
      "5) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City)\nPoor Eintracht Frankfurt. They lost Marmoush to Man City in January after an excellent 15-goal half-season and then lost Ekitike to Liverpool in July after a 15-goal full season. We have a feeling that Marmoush may be brilliant for City in 25/26 after a full Pep pre-season.",
      "But it does mean that we only have Jackson as a viable alternative to Isak so far and things are not about to get any better…",
      "",
      "4) Jonathan Burkardt (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nThe 18-goal Mainz striker is the replacement for Ekitike (or is it Marmoush?) so he’s another Isak-like footballer who is not available to Newcastle United, Liverpool or Manchester United.",
      "",
      "3) Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan)\nNow this is genuinely interesting as the Frenchman was strongly linked with Newcastle United two years ago, while links with Manchester United have been persistent, and even Arsenal have had a sniff.",
      "He scored 14 Serie A goals last season and outscored his xG by 4.1, but the number that might put off potential suitors is his age: He will be 28 next month, making him over two years older than Isak.",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)\nEx-Manchester United footballers will never tire of telling you Manchester United should sign Harry Kane. It ain’t going to happen yet, but we think he will be back.",
      "",
      "1) Georges Mikautadze (Lyon)\nWe predicted a Manchester United move in the wake of his brilliance at Euro 2024 and he has since been linked with the Reds, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United and Sunderland. He would be the cheapest option on this list by some margin, with Lyon looking for around £25m for the Georgian striker who scored 11 Ligue Un goals last season despite starting just 13 games as he found Alexandre Lacazette a difficult man to shift."

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has completed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, which, SSN understands, includes an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa; now Spain switch presents a big opportunity",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 11:34, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."
