      "Erik ten Hag's sacking at Manchester United came just hours after the Premier League side were told to ditch the Dutchman by Jamie O'Hara. The 55-year-old was dismissed from his role at Old Trafford last October, just one day after his side lost 2-1 to West Ham at the London Stadium.",
      "With the Red Devils taking on the east London side on Sunday, it's the first time they'll do so since the first match between the two sides sparked the sacking of Ten Hag after over two years in charge.",
      "The defeat was United's fourth in just nine league games and saw them languishing 14th in the table and it was eventually too much for the club's hierarchy to accept.",
      "However, before the decision came down to remove the ex-Ajax boss from his job, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was told to do just that by O'Hara, who called on the 13-time Premier League champions to get rid of him.",
      "\"I'd get rid of him; I would have gotten rid of him three months ago,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have gave him a contract after the FA Cup, I'd have said, 'Thanks very much, you've finished with a trophy, go out on a high.",
      "\"They should have got something from the game today but overall they've been poor. I've watched them in the Europa League as well and they've been poor.\"",
      "The pundit was proved right as less than 24 hours later, Ten Hag was sacked with United confirming their decision in a statement. It read: \"We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future.",
      "\"Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited.\" While Amorim arrived over two weeks later, United's form only got worse and have remained in the bottom half since Christmas and currently sit 15th with three games to go.",
      "However, the Portuguese boss is on the verge of delivering a European trophy in his first season with his side set to duke it out with Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final later this month.",
      "There have been changes at West Ham also, as Julen Lopetegui was relieved of his duties in early January, four days after their 4-1 loss at Manchester City.",
      "It was ex-Chelsea boss Graham Potter who was appointed as the Spaniard's replacement, but the Hammers' fortunes haven't changed much. They've earned just three league wins in their last 15 games as they sit a lowly 17th."

      "Manchester United will take advantage of a little-known Football Association rule to wear a different home shirt for Sunday's clash with West Ham. The Red Devils will host Graham Potter's side with three games to go in the Premier League season.",
      "On Thursday, Ruben Amorim's men booked their place in the final of the Europa League. Amorim has already admitted that his full attention now rests on that game in Bilbao in a fortnight.",
      "But club chiefs are keen to finish the season strongly, with United sitting down in 15th. The Red Devils will be making history on Sunday by swapping out their iconic home shirt for the first time.",
      "Instead of their normal kit, United will wear a special-edition shirt for the visit of the Hammers. The kit will bear the logo of the RED charity, in place of usual sponsors Snapdragon.",
      "The technology brand have donated their logo space to promote RED's life-saving work through its Global Fund, which focuses on tackling the world's deadliest pandemics, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.",
      "To change kits, United have taken advantage of the little-known section 6(d) of the FA's Kit and Advertising Regulations. The rule allows clubs to temporarily replace their main shirt sponsor with the logo of a charitable organisation for up to three charities a season.",
      "This will be the first time a charitable organisation has appeared on the front of a United shirt for a league fixture. The move has been backed by legendary skipper Gary Neville.",
      "He said: \"By donating the front-of-shirt logo, Snapdragon is showing the world that football can drive real change. Together, we can unite millions of fans to fight global health injustice, harnessing the power of football to make a difference and create a brighter future.\"",
      "In a further move in support of the charity, United, Snapdragon and RED have collaborated with Adidas to create a limited-edition merchandise collection. All net proceeds will be donated to the Global Fund, while fans will also be able to bid for the shirts worn during the matches, with the money raised also supporting the cause.",
      "Amorim meanwhile is focused on protecting his players ahead of the crucial final against Tottenham. He said: \"What I will protect is the players that can get an injury. We have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.",
      "\"Again, we cannot save anything from the Premier League. But I think it's a good thing for them as we'll not have a lot of trainings. They will fight for the places in the final in these games.",
      "\"We also have to acknowledge that we are Manchester United and we need to win games, also in the Premier League, and we have to use every game to improve, even to prepare for the final, but, especially, to prepare for the future.",
      "\"We are trying to do our best but I agree, we can do better. But I have to make a choice. What is the best for the club not what is the best for me. I make a choice in this moment [that] I'm going to try to save all the players because it's really important for us to win the final.\""

      "Ruben Amorim's squad demolished Athletic Club with a 7-1 aggregate victory, setting up a showdown with Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao in just 10 days. Spurs also had an impressive run, beating Bodo/Glimt 5-1 over two legs.",
      "Despite their struggles in domestic competitions, Ange Postecoglou's side have managed to defeat the Red Devils three times this season. For Spurs, lifting the trophy would break a 17-year drought, while for United, it could provide a silver lining to a disappointing season.",
      "It's worth noting that the Europa League winners automatically secure a spot in next season's Champions League. However, for United, this might not be a given.",
      "Previous UEFA rules stated that two clubs under the same ownership can't compete in different European competitions. As Sir Jim Ratcliffe has stakes in both Man United and Ligue 1 team Nice, it would have been impossible for both clubs to play in Europe.",
      "Despite a 2-0 loss to Rennes on Saturday, Nice are well-positioned to qualify for next season's Champions League as they currently sit fourth in the Ligue 1 table.",
      "Last year, the regulations were tweaked to accommodate multiple clubs under the same ownership, with each case being evaluated individually. This is evident in Manchester City and Girona, both part of the City Group, participating in this season's tournament.",
      "United have already encountered issues due to Ratcliffe's involvement with Nice, as seen when Jean-Clair Todibo's move to Old Trafford was blocked. However, there are two reasons for United to remain optimistic about the situation.",
      "Ratcliffe is reportedly considering selling the French club. If the sale goes through before a specific date, assuming United wins the Europa League and Nice secures a Champions League qualification spot, there should be no problems.",
      "Furthermore, it has been clarified that there isn't a one-size-fits-all rule for every situation. Even if Ratcliffe retains stakes in both clubs, there's still a possibility for both to compete among Europe's top teams, as indicated by a UEFA statement.",
      "The statement asserted that \"no one is simultaneously involved, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition; and no one has control or decisive influence over more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition.\"",
      "Therefore, all that's really required is evidence that the two clubs aren't managed concurrently. Ratcliffe's intention to sell his stake in Nice could certainly strengthen their case if the worst happens."

      "The German side could only claim the DFL-Supercup for silverware as Bayern Munich became league champions once again. However, Schick's return to goal-scoring prowess could result in the 29-year-old earning a move abroad. The likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal have been linked to signing the striker after five years at Leverkusen.",
      "The Czech international first cut his teeth in Germany during a loan spell with RB Leipzig in the 2019/20 season from Roma. It turned out to be a success with the striker netting 10 goals in 22 league games, with the side finishing third in the league and reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League.",
      "It was during his stint at Leipzig that Schick revealed that while he had already realised his dream of playing in Italy, the opportunity to compete in England was one that he relished.",
      "\"When I left the Czech Republic, my dream was to play in Italy and I achieved that,' he told iSport.cz in 2020. \"Now, I feel very attracted to England, to be honest. Leipzig was absolutely the right choice for my career. I had also talked to Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke here in Germany.",
      "\"In England, there were Everton and Crystal Palace, plus Valencia in Spain. I just felt that Leipzig wanted me more, and I was also attracted to the playing style of coach Julian Nagelsmann. I am sure that I made the right choice.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's plans to sell Nice have suffered a blow after the French side missed out on automatic qualification for the league phase of the Champions League. Ratcliffe, through his company Ineos, bought Nice back in the summer for 2019 for around £85million.",
      "He has endured a rocky time at the Allianz Riviera though, with the regime deeply unpopular among supporters. Ratcliffe has increasingly turned his focus away from Nice and onto Manchester United.",
      "Despite that lack of attention, Nice have enjoyed their most successful season yet since Ratcliffe took over. After losing manager Francesco Farioli to Ajax last summer following a fifth place finish, Franck Haise was appointed in his place.",
      "With one game to play, Haise has all but secured European football for his side. They currently sit in fourth place, but are level on points with both Lille in fifth and Strasbourg in sixth.",
      "Due to Ligue 1's diminishing status in European football, only the top three in Ligue 1 qualify automatically for the league phase of the Champions League. With one game remaining, Nice cannot catch third-place Monaco, who sit four points ahead of them.",
      "Les Aiglons must beat Brest on the final day to secure their fourth place finish. But they will then face the arduous test of the qualifying rounds, with Ligue 1's fourth-place team entering at the third stage.",
      "That would mean a two-leg play-off for Nice at the start of August, before a final play-off round at the end of that month. Nice's chances of finishing in the top three were dashed by a poor defeat away at mid-table Rennes on Saturday.",
      "Two goals from Arnaud Kalimuendo secured the three points for the hosts. He first turned in a cross from Ludovic Blas after 15 minutes, before breaking through to finish past Marcin Bulka late on.",
      "Missing out on automatic qualification is a serious blow for Ratcliffe's hopes of selling the team. It was revealed last week that the billionaire is looking to move on from the South of France.",
      "He has engaged New York-based investment bank Lazard to find a buyer, with the hope of bringing in £213m. A 'blind trust' have been operating Nice this season, with neither Ineos nor Ratcliffe having 'control or decisive influence' at the club.",
      "That was due to UEFA rules around multi-club operations as both United and Nice qualified for the Europa League. Bringing in such a large fee is already complicated by the TV rights crisis in French football.",
      "And the potential lack of Champions League money coming in is an added blow. Ratcliffe has already made it clear he has little interest in Nice, now he has taken over at United.",
      "\"With Nice, in the French league, you can buy a club for £100million. It’s much cheaper access. But I don’t particularly enjoy going to watch Nice because there are some good players but the level of football is not high enough for me to get excited,\" he told The Times.",
      "“The best season that Nice has had is this one where we’ve not been allowed to get involved because of multi-club ownership rules. They’ve been so much better without our interference! Maybe there’s a lesson there as well, you know.\""

      "It's been 20 years since the Glazer family took the reins at Manchester United. The takeover in May 2005 sparked protests from around 300 United fans outside Old Trafford, and even led to Bobby Charlton issuing a public apology to the owners for their frosty welcome.",
      "Fast forward to 2025, and the family has splashed out more than £2billion on transfers in a bid to secure Premier League and Champions League success, yet they continue to be a bone of contention among the United faithful.",
      "Despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS acquiring a minority stake in the club last February, with aspirations of injecting new life into the club by taking over football operations, there's been little improvement on the pitch.",
      "United ended up in eighth place in the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, despite board support, and this season looks set to be even worse with a record low Premier League position looming.",
      "More investment is definitely needed in the upcoming summer transfer window if the board hopes to turn things around under latest manager Ruben Amorim, but it hasn't always been doom and gloom in the north west.",
      "In fact, some of the first signings made under the new era at Old Trafford went on to have stellar careers with the Red Devils under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Van der Sar was instrumental in helping United clinch the Premier League title in the 2006/07 season, and followed it up with a league, Community Shield, and Champions League treble the next year – showcasing his skills particularly during a nail-biting European final penalty shootout against Chelsea.",
      "With four Premier League titles to his name, Van der Sar bid farewell to United in 2011, having made 266 appearances in total. He left as the club's best goalkeeper since Peter Schmeichel's departure in 1999.",
      "In his post-playing career, Van der Sar became Ajax's marketing director in 2012 before being promoted in late 2016 to the role of CEO. But in May 2023, he resigned from his post.",
      "Just a month after Van der Sar's arrival in the north west, the Red Devils secured the signing of Ji-sung Park from PSV for £4m. The midfielder's transfer marked him as only the second Asian player to sign for the club, following Dong Fangzhuo in 2004.",
      "Although Park didn't score as many goals as fans had anticipated, he was a key part of Ferguson's squad and featured in 45 matches in his first season. Despite his second year being marred by injury, he still managed to secure a Premier League winners' medal after netting five goals in 14 games.",
      "He was also part of the team that clinched the 2008 Champions League title, although he was left out of the squad for the final by Ferguson in a tough call. Park's most fruitful season came in 2010/11 when he netted eight goals in 28 matches before moving to QPR at the end of the season. He retired after returning to former club PSV Eindhoven for the 2013/14 season.",
      "Park completed his coaching badges as he took charge of QPR's Under-16 side as part of his coaching B license. After leaving the west Londoners, Park joined K League 1 side Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors as their technical director in 2022. There, he appointed ex-Chelsea star Dan Petrescu as manager, but the Romanian's time in charge didn't last long as he resigned mid-season.",
      "Park then became an advisor at the club, who opted for another former Chelsea man in the form of Gus Poyet, as he was announced as manager last year.",
      "Ferguson spotted Ben Foster while he was playing for Wrexham in the Football League Trophy final and snapped him up for United for £1m in July 2005. However, his stay in Manchester was short-lived as he was loaned out to Watford to gain some much-needed experience.",
      "He spent two years at Vicarage Road, making 81 appearances before returning to his parent club in summer 2007. A cruciate ligament injury sidelined him for about six months, but Foster finally made his United debut in March 2008.",
      "Sadly, he didn't play another first-team game for the rest of the season. After featuring in a total of 23 games for the club and even winning the League Cup with United twice, Foster moved to Birmingham City on a permanent deal in 2010.",
      "Since retiring from the game after a short spell with Wrexham, the 42-year-old has put plenty of effort and time into his popular podcast, Fozcast.",
      "Nemanja Vidic joined the Red Devils in January 2006 in a £7m deal from Spartak Moscow. Ferguson threw him straight into the mix, with his debut coming in a League Cup semi-final second-leg match against Blackburn.",
      "The centre-back had a rocky start, in and out of the team for his first six months, before forming a formidable partnership with Rio Ferdinand ahead of the 2006/07 season. This duo has since been hailed as one of football's most iconic pairings.",
      "Vidic played a key role in United's Champions League victory in 2008, and also bagged five Premier League titles during his tenure at the club. After making 300 appearances for the Red Devils, Vidic bid farewell to United at the end of the 2013/14 season, having netted 21 goals – an impressive tally for a central defender.",
      "After leaving United, 18 months on the books at Inter Milan followed, before he hung up his boots for good following a string of injury problems that eventually saw his contract terminated by mutual consent.",
      "Torn between Inter Milan and United, Patrice Evra eventually chose a move to England for £5.5m in January 2006. However, the French full-back initially struggled to adapt to the English game.",
      "Despite early hiccups, Evra managed to iron out his mistakes and became a vital part of the United squad, ending his first season with 14 appearances under his belt. Although he wasn't a regular starter in the 2007/08 season, he still contributed significantly to United's Premier League title win and soon became a mainstay in the team."

      "Of the 17 players to have played for both Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League era, Zeki Fryers is among the more likely who would go down as a Pointless answer.",
      "But the left back was once part of a controversial transfer that left Sir Alex Ferguson fuming and calling for a Football Association investigation into what he claimed was “blatant manipulation.”",
      "Fryers had left United for Belgian club Standard Liege in August 2012 for a small compensation fee after Spurs refused to pay £6m. Except by the following January Spurs had paid Standard £3m for Fryers, who claimed he was feeling homesick.",
      "\"I'm disappointed in Tottenham. I think it's a blatant manipulation of the situation,\" Ferguson said not long after the transfer to north London went through. \"I think the league should look into it and I think they should stop his registration until they examine it.\"",
      "Tottenham claimed afterwards that they only made a second approach for Fryers after being made aware that he was not enjoying life in Belgium.",
      "A Spurs spokesman said at the time: \"Zeki enjoyed his time at Standard, however, when Standard sacked their manager in November Zeki wasn't part of the new manager's plans which he accepts and understands happens in football. Unfortunately, a combination of this and the fact he had become homesick meant he wanted to return to England.",
      "\"His representatives made contact with clubs in England. This afforded us a second opportunity to sign the player and as per Fifa's solidarity contribution mechanism, Manchester United will receive 5 per cent of the transfer fee we have paid.\"",
      "Standard Liege later issued a statement which read: \"The young defender felt homesick and had difficulty acclimating to life away from home and family. So when the London club became interested we understood the situation and were not opposed to the return of the player in England.\"",
      "But fuming Ferguson added: \"They tried to buy him from us at the end of last season. They then took him on trial and said they couldn't afford him and all of a sudden he signed for Standard Liege. I expected him to go to Tottenham in the January transfer window. The league should look into it.\"",
      "Fryers, who was most recently playing in the Swedish third tier, went on to make 16 appearances in 18 months at Spurs before moving to Palace, for whom he made 14 appearances."

      "But the smile was back on Old Trafford faces after he got on the scoresheet as United booked a Europa League date with Tottenham with a 7-1 aggregate hammering of Athletic Bilbao. However, Hojlund still admits it's been a disappointing campaign for the Reds.",
      "He said: “We’re very happy about being in the final, but it can’t take away the focus from the entire season. Domestically it has not been good enough - but then again we play to win trophies and we are in a good position to win a European one.",
      "“I think we’ve been improving in the last few weeks, even though the results in the Premier League have not been overly good, just in Europe. But in the Premier League we are gradually getting there - although we know we need to get better.",
      "“Obviously there have been hard times for me. When you go without a goal for a lot of games - I wouldn’t say I lost self-belief, but you’re going to be a bit more down and a bit more frustrated.",
      "“It’s been about going back to basics and focusing on what I can do to try and improve myself. I will check myself, chat with my team-mates, get in better positions…these sorts of things.",
      "“It is the hard times that make you better and you learn a lot from them. I have always said I know what this football club is all about and it’s a lot of pressure, but that is why I’m here. I want to show myself on the biggest stage.",
      "“We are focusing on the opportunity we have here. That can give us something from this year to take into the next season - because winning a trophy is always important for a club this size.”",
      "United now face West Ham at Old Trafford as they attempt to improve their poor Premier League position in the last three games of the season. Amorim has been boosted by the return to action of Amad Diallo, the young winger who has been sidelined for three months with an ankle injury.",
      "Amad produced a stunning cameo performance against Bilbao on Thursday night - and Hojlund said: “Amad is wonderful. I obviously knew him a bit before I came here because we played at Atalanta. Not at the same time, but they talked of him. He’s a great talent, what a player.",
      "“He came through the Atalanta academy. He’s a very good lad, very humble and down to earth. That’s why he is where he is now.",
      "“Last season he didn’t really have a lot of game-time but now he has shown himself and he is so calm and focused on improving. We know his qualities and this season they have been shining through. Full credit to him.”"

      "Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes isn't a fan of Ruben Amorim's approach of playing a weakened side for Premier League matches while chasing European glory. Amorim made major changes to the starting XI for last week's defeat at Brentford, including leaving captain Bruno Fernandes on the bench, in order to keep players fresh to face Athletic Club on Thursday.",
      "United lost 4-3 at the Gtech and then fell behind early on in their Europa League semi-final second leg. They rebounded in style, though, scoring four times in the final 20 minutes to wrap up a 7-1 aggregate victory, but Scholes believes his old employers are taking a big risk.",
      "\"It’s almost as if they go into Premier League games and there’s an acceptance that they’re not going to win the game, which is madness. I think the acceptance has come from everyone.",
      "\"I think it’s come from the manager even though he won’t admit it. He’s not playing teams to win games of football in the league. I think even fans are thinking let’s get these league games out of the way because the league has been a disaster.\"",
      "United aren't the only ones who have attempted to shuffle the pack in the league while competing in Europe. It didn't quite work for Arsenal, who lost their Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, but Spurs' rotation at West Ham last week left them fresh to beat Bodo/Glimt and join Amorim's team in the Europa League final.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's match, Amorim was asked whether he would continue resting senior stars now that a spot in the final has been secured. \"No, they will play because sometimes it's better to play,\" he replied.",
      "\"What I will protect is the players that can get an injury. For example, Bruno, or the last game before Tottenham but we moved the game to the Friday against Chelsea. So we'll have time to recover.",
      "\"We want to win and to be competitive, also in the Premier League. Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury [touches wood] but Harry [Maguire] has. So we have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.\""

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane once admitted that he financially benefited from the Glazer family's takeover of the club. The American ownership has been a contentious issue among fans since they acquired the club 20 years ago.",
      "Writing in his 2014 autobiography, The Second Half, Keane revealed his smart idea to pocket shares in United as part of his contract, meaning he saw a small fortune head his way thanks to the family's acquisition of the Red Devils.",
      "\"From the players’ point of view, it didn’t bother us too much,\" Keane, 53, wrote. \"I had a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me\".",
      "The Glazers are now approaching two decades at the helm of United, having acquired the club from Irish shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus for £790million on May 12, 2005. Initially holding a 57 per cent stake, they increased it to 75 per cent just days later.",
      "Despite the team's early successes under their ownership, including five Premier League titles, the 2008 Champions League, two FA Cups, six League Cups, the Europa League, and the FIFA World Club Cup, fans have expressed concerns about the Glazers draining the club's resources.",
      "Their tenure has been marred by fan protests and widespread dissatisfaction with their management of the club. And the situation reached a head in 2022.",
      "Their reign at the helm of United seemed on the brink in November of that year when they announced the club was up for sale. Keane hailed the move as \"good news\" at the time, criticising the family for prioritising business over their rapport with the supporters.",
      "However, the plot took a twist when Sir Jim Ratcliffe instead acquired a minority 25 per cent share, leaving the Americans in post but with Ratcliffe and his INEOS team taking control of football operations. However, United's financial woes have persisted, with debts mounting and job cuts becoming a regularity under Ratcliffe's time in charge.",
      "While Keane may have profited from the initial sale, he has since been vocal about his disapproval of United's current management. In October 2024, he lamented the transformation of the club on the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"United was always about good people and good characters, but I don't see that now. I don't recognise this team, I don't recognise the club,\" he said.",
      "\"They're chopping and changing and getting rid of everyone in the background which is fine, there's a business side to it, we know that. But when we're discussing Man United, it's more like a business than a football club\"."

      "Manchester United will be hoping to build on Thursday night's 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao when they welcome West Ham United to Old Trafford in the Premier League this afternoon, kick-off 2.15pm.",
      "United booked their place in the Europa League final in midweek with an impressive victory over the Spanish outfit, with goals from Mason Mount (2), Rasmus Hojlund and Casemiro sealing a 7-1 aggregate triumph.",
      "However, focus switches back to domestic matters this afternoon and a league tussle with a Hammers side also experiencing a forgettable Premier League campaign.",
      "United head into the contest winless in their last six league outings and without a home win in the Premier League since the end of February.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim had made changes for the visit of West Ham. Here's the United starting XI: Bayindir; Mazraoui, Yoro, Shaw; Amad, Ugarte, Mainoo, Amass; Fernandes, Mount; Hojlund.",
      "Follow the LIVE blog below for regular updates and analysis from Old Trafford throughout the day.",
      "Three minutes in and we have had the first rendition of Amorim's chant. There are few United players who are serenaded these days. Fernandes often is and he earned that acclaim long ago. It is rather telling that United fans cannot be bothered to add to their biblical songbook for some of the others.",
      "Amad and Fernandes just combined smartly for a shot at goal but the latter could not keep it down.",
      "Mainoo has started in the right hand side No.10 role. Mainoo and Amad are friends away from the pitch and their chemistry should help them link up down that right flank this afternoon. David Moyes is in the directors' box and the West Ham fans chanted his name before kick-off.",
      "We are off and underway at Old Trafford!",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, one of the most redundant employees at United, is in the directors' box in the Ineos row with Omar Berrada and director of communications Toby Craig. Whatever United achieve, it will have nothing to do with a bloke who used to run a cycling team, regardless of how warmly he clasps hands with Diogo Dalot. If United win the Europa League, it’ll be down to Ruben Amorim, his staff and the players.",
      "Both sets of players are starting to gather inside the tunnel ahead of kick-off.",
      "Stay tuned to this LIVE blog for regular updates throughout the afternoon.",
      "The directors' box is a lot sparser today, unsurprisingly. There is only a few million pounds riding on the game (which makes it sound important) and it is such a blissfully warm day many would rather do something else. That said, the majority of the regulars sat around the press box are here today to justify the expense of their season tickets.",
      "The countdown to kick-off at Old Trafford is very nearly over. Stay tuned to this LIVE blog for regular updates throughout the afternoon.",
      "Leny Yoro will be playing between Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw in the back three. Yoro has been on the left recently but will shift inside to accommodate Shaw. The trio are just warming up in order at the moment.",
      "This already has an end-of-season feel to it, mostly because of the gorgeous weather. The players are just finishing their warm ups and should return to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off in a moment.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why he has made six changes to his starting XI for this afternoon's clash with West Ham.",
      "The United boss, as expected, has shuffled his pack for today's game, but the starting line-up is much stronger than almost all of us anticipated.",
      "On the changes, Amorim told MUTV:",
      "\"First of all we want to win the game and perform, it's really important for us. Of course, we are going to save some players that could have the risk of some injury, even if it's a small thing, we are so near a big goal for our season. But we need to win, to perform, and we have players to do that today.\"",

      "United's clash with West Ham is one of five Premier League games taking place today, with the first kicking off at 12pm.",
      "That clash saw Newcastle United and Chelsea go head-to-head at St James' Park and Newcastle currently lead 1-0 with 20 minutes to go.",
      "The rest of today's games see Nottingham Forest host Leicester City (2.15pm), Tottenham Hotspur face Crystal Palace (2.15pm) and Liverpool take on Arsenal at Anfield (4.30pm).",
      "'Really looking forward to Aaron Wan-Bissaka's return'. Said no one. It only just occurred to yours truly that he is making his return to United today. In keeping with the man's character, it is a low-key return.",
      "Someone just said he is one of West Ham's player of the year contenders. He did quite well in the reverse fixture and actually scored, never mind attacked, against Newcastle in the first half of the season.",
      "He did well to have five years at United and win two trophies. He was very good in the FA Cup final, his last appearance for the club.",
      "The assumption is that Kobbie Mainoo will start in one of the No.10 roles, with Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte in the pivot, but the Stockport-born lad could start in the deeper role again. Everyone expected Mainoo to start as a No.10 against Bournemouth last month and he was given another chance in the deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro.",
      "Having deservedly bagged a start after scoring twice via the bench against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night, Mason Mount will be looking to score for the third game running this afternoon.",
      "He scored as a starter at Brentford last weekend and scored two superb goals late on in midweek after coming off the bench.",
      "He has more goals in the past week (three) than he had previously got in the whole of his United career (one).",
      "United have three wins in their last ten and they were all in the Europa League. They have not won a Premier League match since the domestic season restarted after the March internationals. That last league win at Leicester was nearly two months ago on March 16.",
      "If United lose again today, they will still embark on a half-lap of honour and get clapped. The support I can understand. The half-lap of honour I can't. And the happy-clappy reactions are sometimes unbecoming for the club's worst domestic side in 51 years.",
      "There was much more rancour over defeats (City at home and Bournemouth at home) and decisions (substituting Rasmus Hojlund against Brighton and Kobbie Mainoo against Burnley) last season. United supporters are now completely accepting of how bad the team is. And so are people at the club, which is why this season has been a strangely calm one to cover.",
      "A couple of confirmations from Ruben Amorim's latest selection: Christian Eriksen is not deemed up to it in this system and his compatriot, Chido Obi, is not ready to start competitive matches.",
      "Eriksen will be gone by the end of next month. Obi has potential but cannot be one of the two first-team squad strikers next season.",
      "That's a much stronger team than probably everyone expected to see this afternoon. Rasmus Hojlund is the only senior striker who is fit in the dressing room and retains his starting role. That could be seen as a risk ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "Former United right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka has been included in the West Ham starting XI this afternoon.",
      "Your starting XI in Manchester pic.twitter.com/DzxOIft7Af",
      "Looking at that United side, you wonder whether the team against Chelsea will be weaker now. Ruben Amorim was fretting over Noussair Mazraoui in midweek but is starting him today and his inclusion in a back three, as well as Amad on the right wing, feels significant. Those two should be starting in those roles in the final.",
      "United starting XI vs West Ham United: Bayindir; Mazraoui, Yoro, Shaw; Amad, Ugarte, Mainoo, Amass; Fernandes, Mount; Hojlund.",
      "Substitutes: Heaton, Fredricson, Lindelof, Maguire, Dorgu, Eriksen, Casemiro, Garnacho, Obi.",
      "The all-important team news from Old Trafford will be confirmed at 1pm, meaning we will soon be able to bring you details of how United will line-up this afternoon.",
      "The expectation is that head coach Ruben Amorim will ring the changes following Thursday night's 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League.",
      "After making an impressive impact off the bench in midweek, Amad will be desperate to get his first start since overcoming his ankle injury this afternoon.",
      "He should start the Europa League final in just over a week's time and he needs to improve his match sharpness ahead of it.",
      "West Ham haven't won a game for almost three months. They last won against Leicester City on February 27. They've been horrendous in the Premier League this season and haven't made any progress since Graham Potter's appointment.",
      "They've only maintained their top flight status because there are three worse teams, and United should be confident of winning this afternoon, even with a much-changed starting side. West Ham are without a league victory for eight fixtures now and the last time they recorded a longer winless run in the Premier League was between March and May 2011 (they were relegated). That is awful.",
      "Courtesy of Betfair, here are the pre-match odds ahead of today's game at Old Trafford:",
      "The 'keeper was not spotted arriving alongside his teammates this morning. Altay Bayindir is expected to start in goal with Tom Heaton on the bench. Dermot Mee will assist in the warm-ups with goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital.",
      "Read why Onana is missing from today's squad here >>>",
      "We've rarely seen Ruben Amorim smile this season, but there was a wide grin etched across his face when Mason Mount came off the bench to score twice on Thursday night. Mount's first goal was brilliantly taken and the technique for the halfway line goal was tremendous.",
      "Mount's time in Manchester has been stop-start due to a few muscle injuries, but he has continued to do everything right away from the pitch and deserves the rub of the green going forward. Hopefully his display against Athletic Bilbao will ignite his time at the club.",
      "It feels like Chido Obi will make his first start at Old Trafford. The young striker started against Brentford at the Gtech Stadium last weekend. He worked hard and put himself about, but his inexperience was obvious, and Amorim said:",
      "\"Chido fought all game but you can feel he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body. He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these kind of games, this is the best way. So we can take that positive, the rest we didn’t win points so just that.\"",
      "Obi only celebrated his 17th birthday in November and he still has a long way to go.",
      "The Europa League final is 10 days away and Ruben Amorim will spend each of those days preparing for the most important game of the season. Fixtures against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League are sandwiched in between.",
      "There will be several changes to the starting line-up this afternoon and perhaps we will see a first-team debut handed out. Tyler Fredricson, Chido Obi and Harry Amass have done well since their promotion to the senior squad.",
      "Andre Onana has been rested for today's game. Altay Bayindir's post all but confirms he will be starting, with Tom Heaton on the bench.",
      "This has been such a dismal Premier League season the 'Champions League qualifying race' is not even engaging, despite the best efforts of some punters. City had a humiliating draw at Southampton and will still sleepwalk to a top five finish.",
      "Finishing fifth and getting into the Champions League is far worse than winning the Europa League and getting into the competition. Jose Mourinho (of course) made a similar point of United's triumph in 2017. In his case, he deliberately tossed off the league and United finished a comfortable sixth. They could be ten places worse off this season.",
      "Hopefully, for our sake, there is so little to play for between United and West Ham that both teams go hammer-and-tong for a win. One doubts it, though."

      "When Hojlund made the same journey in August 2023, joining United from Atalanta in a move worth up to £72million, he was excited to see the player he had heard so much about in action, but whose trajectory had stalled a little at Old Trafford. While Hojlund was making a big enough impression at Atalanta to catch the eye of United, Amad was getting back into form with an impressive loan spell at Sunderland.",
      "His first start for United last season came only a year ago on Monday, but the last 12 months have seen him make a breathtaking breakthrough, from fringe first-teamer whose days looked to be numbered, to probably the most dynamic and exciting attacking talent in the squad.",
      "There have been 20 goal contributions in 43 games during the last 12 months, despite spending three months on the sidelines with a recent ankle injury, and he has made an instant impact on his return to the side, turning Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg on its head when he came off the bench.",
      "He set up the third goal for Hojlund in the 4-1 win that secured a 7-1 aggregate success against Athletic Club. The Dane pointed to Amad in front of the Stretord End, and when he was asked about him after the match, his face lit up as he explained how people had Atalanta had still talked about his talent.",
      "\"He’s wonderful. I obviously knew him a bit before I came here because we played in the same club. Not at the same time, but they talked of him. They spoke of him very highly. He’s a great talent, what a player,\" he said.",

      "Amorim made eight changes for the clash with the Bees from the 3-0 win over Athletic in the Basque Country less than 72 hours before, with only Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Alejandro Garnacho retaining their places.",
      "The chances are Amorim will make a crop of alterations to the side that started the second leg of the semi-final triumph, meaning the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Amass, Kobbie Mainoo, Christian Eriksen, Mount and Amad will all be targeting starting berths.",
      "Youngsters Jaydan Kamason, who is still waiting to make his senior debut, and Chido Obi will also be vying for starting berths in what will be another Premier League game with very, very little riding on it. Obi made his full league debut last weekend.",
      "Although United's Europa League form has given their supporters plenty to celebrate in the last few weeks, their Premier League form has done anything but. The Reds head into today's game winless in six in the league, losing four.",
      "Of course, strong arguments will be put forward for United's league campaign long since petering out and full focus being applied to their Europa League campaign instead, but the players will still have the ambition of winning and sending their supporters home happy.",

      "One of United's stars of the season, he must start the Europa League final, meaning it is important he builds up his match sharpness ahead of the trip to Spain in just over a week's time.",
      "With no midweek fixture to think about this coming week, Amorim will be tempted to unleash Amad from the off. However, it will be interesting to see if he starts at wing-back or as the right-sided No.10.",
      "Despite highlighting the gulf between academy football and the first-team stage at Brentford last weekend, Chido Obi is worthy of his second start and his first at Old Trafford.",
      "He was tasked with leading the line last Sunday, replacing Hojlund, but he struggled to impose himself on proceedings in the way he would have liked.",
      "However, at the tender age of 17, the only way the Dane is going to adapt to life at the highest level is by playing. Facing a West Ham side that have massively underperformed this season, Obi will fancy his chances of trying to flex his muscles a little more than he did last weekend.",
      "With next to nothing riding on this game, what is the worst that can happen?",
      "For the first time since leaving United last August, Aaron Wan-Bissaka will return to Old Trafford this afternoon. He joined West Ham almost a year ago in a deal worth £15million, signing a seven-year contract.",
      "United always planned to sell Wan-Bissaka last summer in order to recoup a fee for the right-back. His exit also paved the way for Noussair Mazraoui to arrive from Bayern Munich.",
      "Wan-Bissaka, who made 190 appearances during his time at United, has played 35 times for the Hammers this season, chipping in with two goals and three assists.",
      "Producing an unexpected resurrection in the second half of the 2022/23 season under former United boss Erik ten Hag, the London-born defender should receive a warm reception from the home fans."

      "Manchester United have the opportunity to salvage their season with Europa League glory - but they could still be banned from the Champions League next season.",
      "Although the winners of the Europa League automatically qualify for the Champions League next season, that may not necessarily be the case for Ruben Amorim and Co. Under UEFA rules, two clubs under the same ownership are not allowed to compete in European competitions simultaneously, even if they were in different tournaments.",
      "Since Sir Jim Ratcliffe holds stakes in both Manchester United and Ligue 1 side Nice, it would have been prohibited for both clubs to participate in European football at the same time.",
      "The club were facing a similar situation this time last year, with UEFA eventually allowing both clubs to participate in European competition under certain provisions.",
      "Ineos vowed not to transfer players between Nice and United on loan or permanently and the clubs would not engage in any level of cooperation, technical or commercial agreements. The clubs are also prohibited from sharing a joint scouting or player database.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was also forced to transfer his shares in Nice into a 'blind trust', meaning decision-making at the French outfit rests solely under control of a trustee, with other changes also taking place at board level.",
      "However, shares in Nice are due to be transferred back on July 1 this year, meaning the problem could rear its head once again this summer should United secure European qualification.",
      "A statement released by UEFA on July 5, 2024, explains: \"The First Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body (CFCB First Chamber) had previously opened proceedings involving: Girona FC (ESP) and Manchester City FC (ENG); and Manchester United FC (ENG) and OGC Nice (FRA) due to a potential conflict with the multi-club ownership rule provided for in Article 5 of the UEFA club competitions regulations.",
      "\"Following the implementation of significant changes by the concerned investors in Girona FC and OGC Nice (respectively City Football Group and INEOS), the CFCB First Chamber accepted the admission of Girona FC and Manchester City FC to the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League as well as Manchester United FC and OGC Nice to the 2024/25 UEFA Europa League. The clubs were able to demonstrate that such changes brought them into compliance with the multi-club ownership rule, considering that:",
      "\"More specifically, the significant changes made to the ownership, governance, and financial support of the concerned clubs, substantially restrict the investors’ influence and decision-making power over more than one club, ensuring compliance with the multi-club ownership rule during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"In particular, the concerned investors have transferred their shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice to independent trustees through a blind trust structure established under the supervision of the CFCB First Chamber. Such blind trust was accepted by the CFCB First Chamber on an exceptional basis for the 2024/25 UEFA competitions. The trustees will regularly exchange information with the CFCB First Chamber during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"As a result, the following applies at the level of Girona FC and OGC Nice for the 2024/25 season:",
      "\"Furthermore, as additional evidence of their independence, the concerned clubs committed to the following:",
      "\"From 1 July 2025, the shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice will be transferred back to their respective investor. As a result, in the absence of any major modifications to the clubs’ shareholding, governance or financing, the above-mentioned clubs shall be considered, as from that date, under the control or decisive influence of their investor.",
      "\"The CFCB First Chamber will continue to monitor the above-mentioned situations to ensure that the multi-club ownership rule continues to be complied with during the 2024/25 season.\""

      "It has been easy to pick apart Manchester United's recruitment mistakes in recent years, but occasionally, they get things right. As Ruben Amorim plots his Old Trafford rebuild, he has at least a couple of players who can signpost a brighter future.",
      "Despite their success in the Europa League this season, United's route back to the top is not easy. Their base camp is 15th after a desperate domestic season. Yet there are signs of promise and hope for years to come.",
      "Academy graduates Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho offer that. The pair of 20-year-olds have had mixed success under Amorim so far and might see their futures in the spotlight again this summer, but they have the talent to be part of the team, even if both are adapting to new roles in a system they are not accustomed to.",
      "It would be a shame and quite probably a mistake if United opted to cash in on either player. They are two sellable assets at a time when they need to raise funds, and they would be booked as pure profit under PSR rules. Both might not be in Amorim's strongest XI at the start of next season, but they should have roles to play in the future.",
      "Two young players whose immediate futures are absolutely guaranteed are Amad, 22, and Leny Yoro, 19. United paid fees for both as teenagers, but the combined outlay of £96million is beginning to look like a steal as they continue their trajectories.",
      "The path was bumpy for Amad after his £37million move from Atalanta, and there have been times when the initial £19million fee, with a further £18million in add-ons, looked like a waste. But the attacker never gave up. A successful loan spell at Sunderland unlocked his potential, and his rise in the last 12 months has been stratospheric.",
      "He might have been battling Bruno Fernandes for player of the year awards without his recent three-month layoff, but coming on as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao, he showed that the injury hasn't slowed him down. He turned the game with his directness and dribbling ability and must start the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The image of Amad, on his own and surrounded by four defenders in blue shirts, was reminiscent of the famous picture of Diego Maradona in an Argentina shirt facing up to six Belgian defenders.",
      "That's not to compare them as talents, but Amad's work on the ball has the capacity to attract defenders towards him, which can be priceless in opening up space for others.",
      "The question at the moment is whether the Ivorian ends up as a wing-back or as a No. 10 in Amorim's system. In the short term he might be pressed into action on the right, but it has looked recently like Amorim wants him as one of his attacking midfielders, and you can see why that would be the case. He should be a fixture in this team for years to come.",
      "That can be said for Yoro as well, an initial £52million signing from Lille last summer. United beat Real Madrid to his signature, but he suffered a foot injury in his second pre-season game and wasn't fit to start until December, by which time the manager who signed him had gone, and he was being asked to play in a back three system that was unfamiliar to him.",
      "He is now starting to show why many observers consider him the best young centre-back in Europe, and those comparisons with Rio Ferdinand don't look so fanciful. His defending is assured but with obvious room for improvement given his tender age in that position, but his grace in position is particularly eye-catching.",
      "Yoro is starting to show more confidence in carrying the ball forward, which is a vital skill in a wide centre-back role in a back three. He is becoming more of a fixture in the final third.",
      "He set Mason Mount's first goal up against Athletic, and that unpredictability can be a major weapon in United's system.",
      "There are certainly areas where this squad can be improved, and there are plenty of examples of where money has been wasted. But in Amad and Yoro, United have two players who look like generational talents and two players who can form a major part of a successful team under Amorim."

      "Heading into the clash with Hammers winless in their last six league games, the Reds will be determined get three points on the board and increase their confidence levels ahead of the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in just over a week's time.",

      "Amorim isn't going to make wholesale changes to his United side over the next few games but this feels like the ideal opportunity to give some players a rest and get minutes into others, starting in goal, where Tom Heaton deserves a game as he gets closer to signing a one-year contract extension.",
      "In defence, Shaw and Fredricson can come back in. Shaw needs the minutes as he builds up fitness and although Fredricson struggled in the second half last week, this should be easier. Maguire can play the experienced role in the middle.",

      "Mount has to start again after his efforts this week, with Eriksen alongside him, and Obi can come back into the side as Hojlund gets a rest.",
      "Despite having no midweek game to consider this coming week, Amorim should still use the visit of the Hammers to shuffle his pack and increase the fitness levels of players still working their way towards full-match sharpness.",
      "Shaw has rotated between starter and sub in recent games, meaning he should be recalled and start on the left of the back-three. Mazraoui has been pushed to his limit in recent weeks, meaning Kamason deserves the nod at right wing-back to make his debut.",
      "Casemiro and Ugarte are a sure bet to start alongside each other in midfield in the Europa League final, meaning they should not be risked less than 72 hours after their last outing.",

However, if the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle reignite their previous interest in the 25-year-old, and can offer him Champions League football, it will make life difficult for United if they fail to beat Spurs in Bilbao.",

      "\"I have cried a lot with my mother, with my wife and with my siblings. Because we went through very tough times. I am living a dream now.\"",
      "The aim of Antony's temporary switch to the Seville-based club was to try and develop a situation that would benefit both him and United. The former Ajax man, who joined the Reds in September 2022 for £86.3million, needed to get out of Old Trafford to get regular minutes under his belt and find the true version of himself.",
      "Scoring seven goals and registering five assists in 21 games, the winger has created a market for himself ahead of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Betis bosses have waxed lyrical about the winger throughout his time at the club and chief executive Ramon Alarcon confirmed in midweek they would like to extend his stay at the club by a further year, but conceded United will hold all the cards on any decision that is made.",
      "\"Obviously, if someone comes with a very high offer, he's a great player for Manchester [United], and they have the final say,\" Alarcon told El Desmarque. \"But we've always worked with respect.",
      "\"Every week, Manu Fajardo, who has done a spectacular job, has sent them the report from the player's week of training, the tactical and physical report from the player's match, and they've seen that we've taken very good care of their asset.",
      "\"We also have to value the player's commitment, as he has 20 days left with the team and is like one of the team members. We'll see when summer arrives if there's an option to bring him in for another year.\"",
      "Signed for £86.3m less than three years ago, it goes without saying that United paid over the odds, meaning they have no chance of recouping a fee anywhere close to what they paid.",
      "United, under profit and sustainability rules [PSR], will have to bank £32.52m to avoid a loss on him. His current form has created a market for him, meaning his stock is much higher than it was in January, but the aforementioned price tag could still put prospective suitors off.",
      "Another loan exit, this time for a full season, could be United's best chance of offloading Antony again this summer. A season-long loan deal with an option to turn it into a permanent deal at the end of it feels as though that could be the most likely type of deal to be struck.",
      "Whatever happens in the summer, Antony deserves credit for making his mark at Betis in the way he has. La Liga is not as physical as the Premier League and his performances have been much more satisfying to watch.",
      "United will have to hold their hands up and accept they misjudged Erik ten Hag's recommendation to bring him to Old Trafford, but they know they have a £32.5m target to keep in mind."

      "After appearing to be undroppable by Roberto De Zerbi's men earlier in the season, Greenwood has been involved in a number of incidents that have sparked doubts over whether he will stay with Les Phoceens for next season.",
      "Criticism of his work rate from supporters and then attitude by De Zerbi have seen reports link him with a move away. Saudi Pro League clubs have been keen, while Barcelona have been credited with interest previously.",
      "A move to Italy or Spain are understood to be likely for Greenwood, but according to The Telegraph, those close to the striker have speculated that there is growing interest from Premier League clubs.",
      "The report adds that the former United academy graduate is 'pining' for a return to the north of England, with reports in France claiming at least two Premier League clubs are considering a move."

      "Manchester United’s midfield in the past four months has gone from one depleted of quality, energy and skill to compete to no longer being an area of concern for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Back in the final game of 2024, United were outclassed in every department by Newcastle United at Old Trafford, losing 2-0. Over 73,000 spectators witnessed a downbeat United fail to challenge Eddie Howe’s side with gapping holes in Amorim’s system continuing to hinder them.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Casemiro were United’s midfield two on the night and were levels off Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes. As a result, Casemio was an unused substitute for the next five league games and Eriksen played just 11 minutes of Premier League football before March 9.",
      "Summer signing Manuel Ugarte, who cost an initial fee of £42million, became a regular as the season unfolded and Amorim discovered a hidden gem in placing captain Bruno Fernandes slightly deeper to orchestrate play.",
      "Recently, Casemiro has enjoyed a sweet revival of his career at Old Trafford and is now viewed as undroppable. In the two Europa League semi-final victories over Athletic Bilbao, Ugarte and Casemiro have started with Fernandes playing alongside Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Mason Mount’s return to injury, and form, gives Amorim more flexibility in the attacking midfielder roles while Kobbie Mainoo has often replaced one of Ugarte or Casemiro.",
      "Now 33, relying on Casemiro to start week in, week out, should United make it to the Champions League wouldn’t be Amorim’s smartest idea since arriving. Despite his turnaround in recent weeks, new blood is needed with the Brazilian being more of a squad player.",
      "United’s priority for the summer transfer window is clearly to improve the attack for next season. But as they have fallen victim to too many times this season, games are won and lost in the middle of the park.",
      "It’s no surprise the slight increase in potential midfield targets in recent weeks. Ederson, Douglas Luiz, Fermin Lopez and Frenkie de Jong are all names mentioned but the shock link to Tonali, ironically the player who single-handedly put United’s midfield to shame in December, that could be a serious statement of intent.",
      "Reports in Italy have claimed United are ready to make a move for the former AC Milan star this summer in a deal worth €100million (£85m). Corriere dello Sport have suggested the club are set to compete with Juventus to sign the all-round midfielder, with United class as the ‘new big contender’.",
      "The signing, like the majority of business that United can do this summer, relies on them winning the Europa League and booking their spot in the Champions League. Even then, it's hard to see Newcastle even being tempted to sell the midfielder, but there is logic to the move for United.",
      "An uber fit midfielder, Tonali has played 42 games already for Newcastle this season, missing zero Premier League games since his suspension concluded at the start of the season. On the ball, he has completed 83.5% of his passes this term and off the ball, his sheer presence makes him a physical block for teams to play through the middle third.",
      "In Amorim's system, two strong, defensive midfielders are pivotal in shunning attacks and building possession for the more creative sparks in the team to create. At 25, seven years younger than Casemiro, Tonali's energy levels would take the pressure off Fernandes to assist and give him more attacking freedom."

      "Predicting how Manchester United could line up against West Ham United at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon is an almost impossible task.",

      "United came from behind on the night to beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 and progress 7-1 on aggregate, meaning they advanced without too much fuss in the end.",
      "Having moved one step closer towards achieving their primary ambition of winning the Europa League and securing Champions League qualification for next season, Amorim must navigate United's way through Sunday's clash with West Ham and next Friday night's tussle with Chelsea with the trip to the San Mames Stadium at the forefront of his mind.",
      "The Portuguese chief, who has not seen United win at home in the Premier League since February, must now strike the right balance between not pushing his players too hard and ensuring they do not lose their match sharpness ahead of the club's most important game in years.",
      "But considering the clash with West Ham will arrive less than 72 hours after the clash with Athletic, changes will be inevitable against the Londoners.",
      "For example, Amorim, less than 72 hours after the first leg against Athletic, made eight changes to his starting line-up for the 4-3 defeat to Brentford last Sunday, and it would be no great surprise to see him make a similar number of alterations this weekend.",
      "Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Alejandro Garnacho were the survivors from the team that started the first leg against Athletic, but it feels almost too risky to ask the trio to go again on Sunday.",
      "Mason Mount, who scored two brilliant goals to inspire United's third successive four-goal haul at home in the Europa League, and Amad both stepped off the bench and made telling contributions on Thursday night, meaning they will be pushing for starting berths against West Ham.",
      "Amad must start the final in the Basque Country, meaning he needs to increase his minutes to develop his match sharpness after almost three months out with an ankle problem. He has made three substitute appearances since his return at the start of this month.",
      "On the flip side, other players are in need of a breather, not least Noussair Mazraoui. The Moroccan has played in all but two games since his arrival at Old Trafford last August and Amorim admitted post-match on Thursday night that he can sense he is running low on energy.",
      "\"Nous we rest but you can feel Mazraoui does not have the energy in this moment and we will try to help in that department,\" Amorim said.",
      "With Diogo Dalot still sidelined because of a calf problem, the opportunity has never been better for Jaydan Kamason to become United's latest debutant. He has been on the bench for each of United's last four Europa League matches but was surprisingly left out of the squad against Brentford, despite Amorim confirming Mazraoui would play no part.",
      "Kamason, 18, has been one of the shining lights for United's Under-18s this season, coming on in leaps and bounds. He was a key player in their run to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals, earning plenty of plaudits for his contributions in the wins over Chelsea and Arsenal.",
      "Equally comfortable defensively and offensively, the emerging right-back has the athletic profile to do a job in Amorim's system as a wing-back.",
      "He has frequently been training with the first-team in recent weeks and his inclusion in the matchday squad for each of the last four European fixtures is a nod to the progress he has made.",
      "Kamason, who has contributed six assists for United across all youth competitions this season, is an emerging talent that United have high hopes for. Under-18s boss Adam Lawrence described him as a player with \"really big potential\" earlier this year.",
      "With United's Premier League campaign long since having petered out, Amorim can afford to take a risk or two and run the rule over the younger members of his squad ahead of next season.",
      "The Europa League final is all that matters for United between now and the end of the campaign, meaning Amorim should not be afraid to blood new faces into the team and leave opposition managers unsure what to expect.",
      "It is hardly surprising Graham Potter, on Friday, said he had \"no idea\" what to prepare for."

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane once confessed that he financially gained from the Glazer family's takeover of the club.",
      "The American ownership has been a contentious issue with supporters since their acquisition two decades ago. In his 2014 autobiography, The Second Half, Keane revealed how an astute decision to include shares in United as part of his contract led to a tidy sum following the family's purchase of the Red Devils.",
      "\"From the players' point of view, it didn't bother us too much,\" Keane, 53, wrote. \"I had a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me\".",
      "The Glazers are now nearing their third of ownership having acquired the shares from their £790 million buyout on May 12, 2005. They initially took over a 57 per cent stake from Irish shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, which quickly became a 75 per cent majority just days later.",
      "Since then, their tenure has been a consistent source of frustration. Protests have been frequent and widespread dissatisfaction with their management of the club is a common concern among fans.",
      "Despite securing the Premier League title five times, the Champions League in 2008, the FA Cup twice, the League Cup six times, as well as the Europa League and FIFA World Club Cup under their leadership, fans remain concerned about the Glazers draining the club's resources.",
      "Their reign at the pinnacle of United appeared to be in coming to an end in November 2022 when they announced the club was on the market. Keane hailed the development as \"good news\", criticising the family for prioritising business over their rapport with supporters.",
      "Subsequently, Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a 25 per cent share, leaving the Glazers as the predominant stakeholders but granting Ratcliffe control over football operations.",
      "Nevertheless, United's financial health has deteriorated, with revenues falling and debts rising. The club has also experienced job cuts and austerity measures since Ratcliffe's involvement.",
      "Although Keane may have profited from the initial sale, he has openly condemned the current management of United. In an October 2024 appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, he lamented the transformation of the club.",
      "\"United was always about good people and good characters, but I don't see that now. I don't recognise this team, I don't recognise the club,\" Keane said.",
      "\"They're chopping and changing and getting rid of everyone in the background which is fine, there's a business side to it, we know that. But when we're discussing Man United it's more like a business than a football club\"."

      "But both Greenwood and Marseille have returned to form at the right time, with three goals and an assist from the 23-year-old helping the Ligue 1 side to three wins and a draw in their last four games.",

      "",
      "The year: 1955\nThe honoured: Chelsea\nThe honourers: Manchester United\nThe reason: Chelsea’s first title win",
      "It was Matt Busby who orchestrated the first known example of a guard of honour in top-flight English football and unwittingly started this curious obsession. Chelsea captain Roy Bentley later recalled that he “made sure we got the full red-carpet treatment” at Stamford Bridge in the final game of the season, the legendary manager even eulogising the Blues in the matchday programme.",
      "Bentley went on to score in a 2-1 defeat to United, who finished five points behind in fifth. Busby’s side won the title in both the next two seasons, presumably powered by shame.",
      "",
      "The year: 1974\nThe honoured: Leeds\nThe honourers: QPR\nThe reason: Leeds’ second First Division title",
      "Liverpool losing 1-0 at home to Arsenal confirmed that the wonderful Don Revie would have a championship to show for his final season in charge of Leeds, and QPR were happy to pay tribute to one of the most dominant teams of the era.",
      "Allan Clarke capped the club’s stellar campaign with the only goal in west London, before those title medals were consigned to the biggest dustbin the players could find.",
      "",
      "The year: 1979\nThe honoured: Liverpool\nThe honourers: Leeds\nThe reason: A third Liverpool title in four years",
      "It might be that Liverpool were toasted by the opposition for their exploits in 1973, 1976, 1977 and beyond, but the only official record is of Leeds upholding tradition and paying their respects to a team that would reign as European champions for only two more weeks in 1979.",
      "Liverpool thanked them by securing a 3-0 win at Elland Road that set two unbroken top-flight records: most points in a top-flight season with two for a win (68); and fewest goals conceded in a 42-game campaign (16).",
      "",
      "The year: 1991\nThe honoured: Arsenal\nThe honourers: Manchester United\nThe reason: Winning the First Division title (and thus stopping Liverpool)",
      "Alex Ferguson had a Cup Winners’ Cup final against Barcelona to prepare for nine days later but was never likely to miss an opportunity to recognise greatness and humble his players.",
      "It is unknown whether he would have been quite so keen had it not been Liverpool who Arsenal won the title at the expense of. But the Reds slipping to defeat earlier in the day against Nottingham Forest meant Manchester United lined up to applaud the champions at Highbury before Alan Smith scored a decisive hat-trick.",

      "‘I had no intention of surrendering to Abramovich’s wealth in the months to come,’ wrote Sir Alex Ferguson in his 2013 autobiography of the time he ordered his players to assemble and welcome England’s new champions to Old Trafford. Chelsea returned the favour by coming from behind to win and set a new Premier League points record of 94, which they would extend with a draw at Newcastle – who also provided a guard of honour – on the final day.",
      "Phil Neville later recalled that “it was almost like Sir Alex enjoyed it” and “it was almost like a motivation for the season after to make sure that it didn’t happen again”. Chelsea retained the title and poor PNev was sold in between.",
      "",
      "The year: 2007\nThe honoured: Manchester United\nThe honourers: Chelsea\nThe reason: Manchester United winning their first Premier League title in four years",
      "While Gary Neville, Roy Keane, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy were in the starting line-up which gave Chelsea a guard of honour two years prior, neither Ferguson nor Jose Mourinho picked full-strength teams when the Blues offered that same courtesy at Stamford Bridge in 2007.",
      "We did at least get the sight of John Terry clapping Kieran Lee, Chris Eagles and Dong Fangzhuo onto the pitch before a 0-0 draw. Yet that somehow isn’t the most embarrassing guard of honour involving Chelsea’s Captain, Leader, Legend.",

      "The year: 2011\nThe honoured: Manchester United\nThe honourers: Blackpool\nThe reason: Manchester United’s title win",
      "A cagey 1-1 draw against Blackburn in the previous game had delivered what remains Manchester United’s penultimate Premier League title. Blackpool needed an unlikely win at Old Trafford to preserve their top-flight status on the final day and even took a brief 2-1 lead through Charlie Adam and Gary Taylor-Fletcher, but eventually lost 4-2 to a team that had dropped two points at home all season.",
      "It was a given that Ian Holloway would get his players to pay tribute before the game.",

      "The year: 2013\nThe honoured: Manchester United\nThe honourers: Arsenal\nThe reason: The little boy within Robin van Persie",
      "One of the most memorable instances of a weirdly popular genre. Absolutely the most awkward and compelling, as Arsenal stood in orderly fashion to welcome England’s new champions to a soundtrack of boos that built to a crescendo as Robin van Persie was the last United player to walk out, later scoring a penalty on his return to north London.",
      "“I want the traditions of English football to be respected,” said Arsene Wenger. “That is what great clubs should do,” said Ferguson. “**** off you ******* ******** ************ Marouane Chamakh wannabe ******* ********,” said the Arsenal fans.",

      "Even though Mourinho pointed out that “it’s a bit artificial” if “some of them don’t want to be there and they are just there because somebody tells them to be there”, Brendan Rodgers ensured the manners of his Liverpool players did not slip in 2015.",
      "Steven Gerrard admitted “it wasn’t nice doing it” but did spare a word or nine for the Chelsea fans who had taunted him all game before partaking in a standing ovation upon his 79th-minute substitution: “Nice of them to turn up today for once.”",
      "",
      "The year: 2016\nThe honoured: Leicester\nThe honourers: Everton and Chelsea\nThe reason: Leicester had won the sodding title",
      "With Tottenham only managing a draw against Chelsea in Mark Clattenburg’s directorial debut, the miracle was complete. Leicester were Premier League champions and had two games – home and away – to bask in that glory.",
      "First was Everton at the King Power Stadium, who duly rolled over in a 3-1 defeat. Then came the team Leicester had replaced on the throne, as Chelsea marked their worst season in a generation by applauding the Foxes on at Stamford Bridge and letting Danny Drinkwater score to secure his fondest memory at a stadium he would soon technically call his own for five entire years.",
      "",
      "The year: 2017\nThe honoured: Chelsea\nThe honourers: Watford and Sunderland\nThe reason: Chelsea’s fifth Premier League title",
      "Chelsea, much as Manchester United, seem to do it because they know the roles will be reversed soon enough. That came to pass the following year when Antonio Conte guided them to the summit with two games to spare, both of which Watford and Sunderland marked appropriately at Stamford Bridge.",

      "The year: 2018\nThe honoured: Manchester City\nThe honourers: Swansea, West Ham, Huddersfield and Brighton\nThe reason: Manchester City’s third Premier League title",
      "There was no time for a guard of honour in either 2012 or 2014, with both titles won on the final day. So Manchester City decided to claim their third Premier League trophy with five games left, the first four of which were honoured by Swansea, West Ham, Huddersfield and Brighton. But not Southampton, as Mark Hughes explained:",
      "“I did ask about if we were going to do that but they said they were going to have a line of flags, kits and guys from the academy so we thought that was more appropriate but it wasn’t a sign of disrespect from ourselves – absolutely not.”",

      "Last season, everything Foden touched turned to gold, but he has been rotten this term and his alarming decline has sparked internal ‘concerns’.",
      "Fatigue is likely a contributing factor as he risks being left behind during Thomas Tuchel’s England era and returning to the periphery at Man City, starting only 20 Premier League games this season.",
      "Still, Foden is *somehow* only 24 and has already racked up over 300 appearances for his boyhood club, so hitting a brick wall is understandable.",
      "He can be forgiven for having a season off, as long as he returns to form next season. For a player of his immense ability, it is surely only a matter of time before this happens and Kevin De Bruyne’s exit gives him the opportunity to finally become Man City’s main man.",

      "Lewis is one such example as he’s previously displayed the appropriate level of footballing intelligence to fill various roles in Guardiola’s fluid system. But this season has been chastising for the 20-year-old, with his head coach resorting to playing Matheus Nunes right-back over him following Kyle Walker’s exit.",
      "Lewis is far from the finished article and still needs to develop physically, but unless City buy a new right-back, he remains the obvious long-term option – and more experience should help him win back Guardiola’s trust.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "The Sweden international is among Europe’s top scorers in 2025, netting a remarkable 95 goals in 99 appearances for Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Arsenal are not alone in targeting Gyokeres, with a move to Man Utd mooted after he worked well under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",

      "Arsenal have also ‘submitted their ‘first official offer’ to Sporting Lisbon’s hierarchy, with the bid reportedly worth around 75 million euros (around £63m).",

      "“You can be good in your club, in your league, but when you go to the Premier League, it’s different,” Gallas said.",
      "“Nobody can deny that Gyokeres hasn’t been one of the hottest strikers in Europe for two seasons now, but he’s been doing it in Portugal. The argument would be that he has scored goals in the Champions League, but there are still doubts about his pedigree in the Premier League.",
      "“Isak, at Newcastle, he was not good at the beginning. He was a good player, but he didn’t have that performance level that he has right now. You need to know if you can give your players time to adapt.",
      "“But sometimes you can’t wait, you need a striker who can score right away. That would be my concern about Gyokeres. I would go for Isak, because he is already proven in the Premier League. He’s already posing problems and already knows how to deal with the opponents.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the calendar year on an absolutely ridiculous 52 goals. Can he do it again?",

It’s one thing getting your chance and blowing it (Antony of 2024 I’m looking at you), but Mount hasn’t really had a shot at all. By all accounts that is through no shortage of hard work on his part.",

The jury is still out for me in terms of what exactly he does, but it’s great to see him thrive now with the platform to show it.

PSG are in here, but really need to win something other than League 1.",
      "The third tier are clubs that were once powerful but time has moved on and they are now operating in small leagues, Ajax, Benfica and the like. A team that seeing their jersey makes you nostalgic but you know they will never be back at the top table. Forest and Villa may be dancing around the edges of this group for English football fans of a certain vintage, but they are more sparkling wine than champagne.",

This is where a fair number of teams reside, if you draw them in Europe its an ‘ah that’s’ nice sort of fixture rather than the excitement of drawing one of the above. I reckon this is where Arsenal sit, they have more money than their counterparts in other leagues but a decent Scandinavian outfit will fancy beating them every so often.",

Tottenham may have a shiny stadium and Brentford may be well run but they just don’t cut it. Celtic probably reside here, not enough European success to be in the third tier.",

Nobody has said that much (365 aside) about Solanke (and I hate to say this) not properly delivering on a 65m investment. About world cup winner’s being crap. About Madders going missing.

      "“Manchester United have an ageing squad,” he said.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, who has a massive job on his hands, has brought a lot of young players through. They have to keep their hands off the panic button this summer. They need to give him time, and there are players there that he needs to move on.”",
      "Waddle also stressed that United’s biggest challenge this summer might not be who they bring in, but who they can afford to get off the books.",
      "“They need a big investment,” he continued.",
      "“Four or five players need to come in, but the even bigger challenge will be getting rid of some. They’re on massive wages. The clubs that will want them won’t have the financial muscle United do, and it’ll be tough to sell them on to Italy or Spain.”",
      "Amorim is expected to be backed in the transfer market this summer as Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe look to reshape the first team and staff structure behind the scenes. But patience, Waddle thinks, will be just as important as new signings.",
      "“They lost 4-3 to Brentford, but until Amorim gets his own team together, it’s too early to judge. I think the top six is still a massive challenge for United next season. They need two or three years with Amorim in charge. They have to stop changing managers.”",
      "Still, the club is moving early to secure what could be their first major incoming of the Amorim era – a dynamic, versatile forward who has been one of the standout attacking players outside the traditional top six this season.",

      "Waddle, while full of praise for the Brazilian’s ability, was quick to temper the hype.",
      "“Cunha is a fantastic footballer. He can be temperamental, but perhaps United would be the making of him,” he said. “You can’t be mardy at a club like that — the fans will let you know.”",
      "Cunha, 25, has scored 15 Premier League goals this season for Wolves and is widely viewed as ready for a step up. Waddle believes the move could be transformative if the player embraces the pressure.",
      "“He probably thinks he’s at the stage when he should be at a club like United. Wolves are a big club, but Cunha will be looking for another level up.",
      "“He’s got a huge opportunity here. If he’s one of the players to turn United around and [get them] challenging again, he could be like Eric Cantona, the man who changed United.”",
      "It’s a lofty comparison, but one that hints at the scale of hope and expectation surrounding Amorim’s first major recruit.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",

      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

      "United beat Athletic Club 4-1 at Old Trafford to secure a 7-1 aggregate win over the Spanish side in their semi-final, while Tottenham won 2-0 away at Bodo/Glimt to ease through 5-1 across two legs.",
      "It means we’re set for an all-Premier League final on May 21 between two sides who have endured miserable domestic campaigns.",
      "United and Spurs are 15th and 16th respectively in the Premier League, but have made relatively light work in getting to the final of a competition which not only offers the chance of unlikely silverware in a dire season but would also grant them entry into the Champions League next season.",
      "And Scholes thinks the “history” of United will see them claim the trophy, despite the Red Devils losing to Spurs on three occasions already this season.",
      "“We know Spurs have beat them three times this season and they’re a really good team. I like Tottenham.",
      "“If they watch that first 70 minutes [of United’s second leg against Bilbao] Spurs will think they’ve got a good chance.",
      "“But I just think about the history of this club. It’s almost like Real Madrid at times, they can not play well and still win cups.",
      "“I just feels the odds are slightly in United’s favour. But I do think Spurs are a good side on their day.",
      "“I just think the history and the experience of the club will get them over the line. I really like Ange and think he’s got a good team but I just favour Manchester United.”",
      "Scholes’ former United teammate Owen Hargreaves added: “It’s going to be fascinating. There is so much at stake for everyone.",
      "“But if United in a down season can win a trophy and get into Champions League, it tells you what the club is all about.",

      "Spurs have looked oddly at ease in Europe, completely contradicting their Premier League form, while Ruben Amorim’s side remain the only unbeaten team in European competition this season.",
      "They brushed aside Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate, with a pair of three-goal wins. And while Thursday’s second leg flirted with drama, the failure of Bilbao to find a second goal meant Old Trafford never truly descended into panic.",
      "In a competition United have to win, Amorim took no risks, naming the same XI that had coasted to victory in Spain.",
      "It was never going to be as easy this time – it simply couldn’t go any worse for Ernesto Valverde and his players than it had in the first leg. Even without the Williams brothers, with both Nico and Inaki ruled out through injury. Yes, that Inaki Williams – the one who once played 251 straight La Liga games. Turns out he’s not indestructible.",
      "Bilbao were trying to overturn a 3-0 deficit against a side worth considerably more than them. To put it into context, they’ve only twice spent more on a player than United did just to sack Erik ten Hag and hire Amorim. There’s your pointless stat of the night.",
      "And yet, for all that disparity, any away side has a bit of hope at Old Trafford these days. Bilbao gave it a go. The issue? Finishing. Or lack of it.",
      "Alex Berenguer tried to find the postage stamp and overhit it. Mikel Jauregizar, just 21, did manage their only shot on target – a lovely long-range strike that Andre Onana parried into the net.",
      "It was a brutal 60 seconds for United: Bilbao scored to inject a bit of tension, and at the same time, £80million flop Antony was bending in a free-kick for Real Betis. Manchester United players getting good again the second they leave Old Trafford’s orbit will never not be funny.",
      "Another common occurrence is Alejandro Garnacho missing simple one-on-ones. His dink wide only added to the unease, and the sense grew that Bilbao might just nick a second and make this properly nervy.",
      "But it didn’t happen.",
      "Mason Mount’s sublime equaliser killed the tie and Bilbao completely gave up. Casemiro added another – a header, as in the first leg – just to rub it in and make sure United’s unbeaten record in Europe lives on.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund thought he’d rounded it off with a tap-in, but the cherry was reserved for Mount’s second – and third in two games – a left-footed effort from somewhere near Salford. Listen, fair play.",
      "Amorim’s subs did the damage. Mount bagged a brace. Amad Diallo set up Hojlund. Kobbie Mainoo squeezed in two take-ons in just 11 minutes. Lovely job.",
      "And so, we get the final we didn’t know we needed: two broken Premier League giants, 15th vs 16th, 35 combined defeats, not a single one of them on 40 points. And yet, they’ll meet in Bilbao with a place in next season’s Champions League and millions on the line.",
      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Including four Manchester United players, transfer expert David Ornstein has named 22 players ‘available’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "It promises to be a busy summer, with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all targeting a striker.",
      "Several strikers are being linked with moves to the Premier League, including RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Lille’s Jonathan David, while Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap are expected to join another English club.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",
      "However, they will need to sell players in order to buy, and Ornstein has stated that they have three players they could sell. Christian Eriksen will also be available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract.",
      "In addition to Eriksen, Ornstein mentions that on-loan stars Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are ‘available’.",
      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle and Man United are being strongly linked with the Cameroonian.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nWho will take a chance on Darwin, then? A Liverpool exit seems inevitable.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nOut of favour at Arsenal, who are addicted to signing left-backs under Mikel Arteta, Zinchenko will leave this summer and knowing the Gunners, they’ll get £5m for him and he will go on to be world-class elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nNewcastle tried and failed last summer. They should come back for him in June.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Jorrel Hato (Ajax), Mike Maignan (Milan) and Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nThe rest, I guess. The only surprise out of these four is AC Milan and France goalkeeper Maignan. He is club captain and his country’s long-term No. 1, but he is out of contract next year so the Italian giants could seek a fee this summer.",
      "Tah, meanwhile, is out of contract in 2025 and wanted by a host of clubs. The latest we have on Gittens is that Arsenal want him, and Hato is one of the most promising defenders in the world and wanted by every top club."

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",

      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",

      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",

      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",

      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",

      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",

It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season - a huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",

      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",

      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
      "Tottenham await Man Utd in the Europa League final, which takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim claims his team could be the worst Premier League side to lift a European trophy; United face Athletic Club in the second leg of the Europa League semi-final on Thursday and hold a 3-0 lead",
      "Thursday 8 May 2025 21:02, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has claimed his side could be the \"worst Premier League side to win a European trophy\" if they go on to lift the Europa League.",
      "United head into the second leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Club with a 3-0 lead as they look to book their place in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\"",
      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
      "\"That is it.\"",
      "They join long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee on the sidelines.",
      "Garancho says he is \"happy\" at the club amid interest from Napoli and Chelsea.",
      "\"As a footballer, you will hear rumours about the future,\" he said. \"I am contracted until 2028, and I am happy here.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Daily Mail report this week claimed Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could be the target for a big-money offer from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal this summer.",
      "The Portugal international's representatives reportedly held talks with Al Hilal on Monday after initial contact between the two camps last year before Fernandes signed his new Old Trafford deal until the summer of 2027, which has an option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""
