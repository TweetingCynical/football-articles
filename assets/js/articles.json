      "Jonny Evans' wife Helen shared an emotional post after the veteran defender finally ended his long-running association with Manchester United after two spells. Evans said farewell after their 2-0 win over Aston Villa to round off the season, having clocked up 241 appearances in total for the Red Devils.",
      "Evans joined United as a ten-year-old and played 198 times in his first spell before joining West Brom and later turning out for Leicester City. Eight years later he return to United on a short term deal in 2023 to bolster the team's numbers in pre-season - but that turned permanent after he impressed on tour.",
      "The 37-year-old met wife Helen during his initial spell at United and the pair enjoyed some touching scenes with fans after the Villa game as they said a final goodbye to the club.",
      "Helen celebrated her partner's career achievements since meeting Evans in 2013, having welcomed three children with the centre-back, before lauding United fans for their support.",
      "\"12 years later, 8 year break in the middle and 3 kids added to the squad... over and out OT!' Helen said in a social media post. \"Best fans in the world.\"",
      "Evans leaves United with three Premier League titles, two League Cups, one FA Cup and the Champions League and will go down as a club legend.",
      "He has netted eight times in total at United and has a career total of 537 appearances and 23 goals. On the international stage, he earned 107 caps for Northern Ireland.",
      "He was given a rousing reception from supporters as the club announcer hailed the trophies he had won with the Red Devils and was embraced by his team-mates.",
      "Evans is one of three players who are set to depart on free transfers, along with Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof as United look to make sweeping changes this summer.",
      "A United statement hailed Evans for \"serving United with distinction for more than a decade as a senior player, across two spells at the club\".",
      "Ahead of the Villa game, they said: \"Manchester United have confirmed that Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Christian Eriksen will leave the club at the end of the season.",
      "\"Everybody at United thanks Victor, Jonny and Christian for their contributions during their time at Old Trafford, and wishes them the best of luck for the future. Each of them received a great ovation from the appreciative crowd on Sunday.\"",

      "Former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has been appointed the new manager of Bayer Leverkusen. The German club have announced that Ten Hag has signed an initial two-year contract, replacing Xabi Alonso after he joined Real Madrid.",
      "The Dutchman was chosen by Leverkusen after they were unable to prise preferred candidate Cesc Fabregas away from Italian side Como following talks between the two clubs. Ten Hag, 55, has been out of work since October when he was sacked by United.",
      "Having joined the Red Devils from Ajax in 2022, Ten Hag won two trophies - the League Cup and FA Cup - over the course of his tumultuous tenure. Ten Hag's position was under threat last season following an eighth-place finish before United's new hierarchy decided on keeping him.",
      "The ex-Ajax, Utrecht and Go Ahead Eagles boss was then backed with £200million in the summer, but failure to improve results led to his dismissal. Ten Hag was patient after departing Old Trafford, focussing on ventures outside of football.",
      "It's understood that he wanted to wait until the summer to return to management. And his patience has paid off with a move to former Bundesliga champions Leverkusen.",
      "They've confirmed that Ten Hag has signed a contract until 2027. Unfortunately for the 55-year-old, he's set to miss out on the chance to coach some of Leverkusen's best players who helped them win the title in 2024.",
      "Defender Jonathan Tah has opted not to sign a new contract and will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer. Meanwhile, star attacker Florian Wirtz and highly-rated wing-back Jeremie Frimpong are both in talks to join Liverpool, potentially banking Leverkusen close to £150m.",
      "It's not the first time that Ten Hag has worked in Germany. He spent two seasons in charge of Bayern's reserves between 2013 and 2015, learning from then-first-team manager Pep Guardiola.",
      "Recently, Ten Hag opened on life outside of coaching. \"There are so many other things I could do,\" he told the SEG Stories podcast. \"Maybe in football, in a new position as a manager. That's an option. And maybe something completely different.\"",
      "Ten Hag added: \"I've been working with my brothers lately. We have our own company. Or rather; they have their own company. But we also run a company together with our father. That's also something I love to do I can now give that more attention and it's also a lot of fun.\""

      "The 20-year-old winger attracted interest from Napoli and Chelsea in the January transfer window. And after admitting his frustration at being benched for United’s Europa League final defeat by Spurs, it seems a summer move is on the cards.",
      "The i Paper reports that Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna will soon meet with United officials to begin the negotiation process over Garnacho. The Italian champions saw a £40million bid rejected in January and have been told that United value the Argentina international at closer to £70m.",
      "It is understood that a compromise closer to £50m could be reached, while Napoli are also trying to sign Kevin De Bruyne on a free transfer following his exit from Manchester City. Napoli secured the title under Antonio Conte, but are braced for a summer of change, with the ex-Chelsea boss set to step aside.",

      "United will pay the Brazilian's £62.5million release clause and make him their first signing of the summer transfer window. Cunha, 25, impressed Old Trafford chiefs after firing Wolves to safety with 15 goals and six assists in the Premier League.",
      "Entering his peak years and proven in the English top flight, the ex-Atletico Madrid forward is viewed as the ideal signing to transform Ruben Amorim's goal-shy attack. Cunha was the subject of interest from Arsenal and Nottingham Forest in the January transfer window, but despite not playing in Europe next season, United have convinced him to head north.",
      "talkSPORT claim that in order to sweeten the deal, Cunha will be given the No.10 shirt. Rashford has sported the number since 2018 but after being made available for transfer, he'll reportedly lose it.",
      "The England international has no future under Amorim, who sanctioned his loan to Aston Villa in January. Rashford wasn't included in United's 32-man squad for their post-season trip to Asia this week which comes after their 2-0 win against 10-man Villa on Sunday.",
      "While Amorim was giving a speech to the Old Trafford crowd and vowed that 'the good times are coming', Cunha appeared to wave goodbye to Molineux, where he's spent the last two-and-a-half seasons. The 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes as Wolves drew 1-1 at home to Brentford.",

      "That's it then: the 2024-25 Premier League season is officially in the books and it was one to remember for Arne Slot and Liverpool.",
      "Few people fancied the Reds to win the title in the Dutchman's first year at the helm. But Slot handled the unenviable task of slipping into Jurgen Klopp's sizeable shoes with ease to make history at the expense of Arsenal, who have to make do with silver for a third successive year.",
      "Then it got interesting. After a frenetic final day Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle booked themselves their spots in the Champions League. Aston Villa will feel aggrieved after a controversial refereeing decision cost them at Manchester United - and they now have to make do with the Europa League.",
      "Things at the bottom have been decided for months. The three who came up are going straight back down. In truth Leicester, Southampton and Ipswich have struggled to put up much of a fight.",
      "We've had some shining lights, as we always do, in England's top flight. Some have come out of nowhere, others have been as brilliant as usual. Equally we've had individuals who have massively underwhelmed.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Come on, who gave him a shot? To go into a mega club, following a legend - and then winning the title by an absolute country mile. What a story. He has done it brilliantly, too. Managing the squad, fitness and overseeing incredible consistency.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "I am sick and tired of managers saying they are going to stick to their principles. What? At the expense of results? If you do not have the players to play a certain formation, then change. It is a weakness and inflexibilibity. Not a strength. He has underperformed to whole new levels.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Goals, assists and highlights. I love the way he has taken his game to new levels. Just brilliant. He has lit up the Premier League.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Dean Huijsen",
      "I love this player. And it also allows me to give a big hat tip to Bournemouth for a terrific season. Bought for a modest price, sold to Real Madrid for £50m. What a season.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Seeing the bottom three go down again. That’s two years running. That impacts on the Premier League. The top five has been supremely competitive. The bottom three boring, predictable and hopeless. That is what you get when the gap is too big. It’s a huge worry for all. I excuse Ipswich as they gave it a go - but even they fell so short.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "What a signing. £12m from Fiorentina. One of the best stories of the season. I’d have him in my Team of the Year. Uncompromising, strong and defiant. Terrific. Incredible player for Forest. I’ve done about six double takes to check it was just last summer and the price. Brilliant business.",
      "Worst transfer: Riccardo Calafiori",
      "I want to be absolutely clear here. I like Calafiori and I think he’s such a good player (even though Arsenal spent £42m on a player with a bad injury record). But Arsenal bought a left back when they already had left backs coming out of their ears. And they needed a striker. Any striker. Just a striker. And they signed a left back. That is why Arsenal fell short. Awful transfer business.",
      "Biggest moment: Mo Salah celebrating the title at Anfield in front of the Kop. Just beautiful. Five years ago, there were no fans. This time it was for the fans. What a great season and story.",
      "Team of the year: Crystal Palace",
      "I’ll be clear. My team of the year was Liverpool. But I’ve given them manager, player and moment. I want to celebrate Palace and their FA Cup win. Amazing. To win against one of the teams in English football history in Manchester City, is just sensational. But it was the fans. Oliver Glasner. They turned Wembley blue and red. What an upset. They wrote their name into FA Cup folklore and won the first trophy in their history. I loved it.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Came in to replace Jurgen Klopp, big shoes to fill but he didn't walk in the German's path. He created his own and took Liverpool to the Premier League title.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric",
      "Few candidates but how Southampton went down without a fight after he replaced Russell Martin was, quite frankly, pathetic. Doubt we will see him in England again.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Only one winner. Outstanding goal return, loads of assists and one of the main reasons Liverpool are champions of England.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Ryan Gravenberch",
      "Didn't look like that smart of a signing last season when he joined from Bayern Munich and had little impact. But in his new No 6 role under Arne Slot, he became one of the best players this season in the Premier League.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Kobbie Mainoo",
      "After his breakthrough last season, we expected so much from the player who scored in the FA Cup final and started for England in the Euros final but injuries, manager change and a struggle to fit into a new system has seen him struggle for most of the campaign. Will be hoping to bounce back next term.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "Signed for £12m from Juventus and sold for £50m already to Real Madrid. From a financial perspective it couldn't have been a better move from Bournemouth but the Spain defender was also brilliant this season for the Cherries.",
      "Worst transfer: Jadon Sancho",
      "\"Freedom\" he said about Marcus Rashford's move to Aston Villa but he didn't use his own \"freedom\" to prove Manchester United wrong and now Chelsea are going to pay £5m to send him back instead of taking up the £25m obligation to buy him. That tells its own story.",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning FA Cup",
      "Their first ever major trophy and beating big boys Manchester City at Wembley. The scenes were epic and it should be a reminder to every mid-table team manager who plays a weakened team in the Cup what those days can bring for fans.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Sometimes a new manager doesn’t need to take a sledgehammer to what’s gone before, and instead just needs a subtle touch. That’s what Slot brought to Anfield, tweaking things here and there with the same players that Jurgen Klopp had in his final season as they finished off the title pace. He rejuvenated some players, got a little bit extra out of others and led them to the title, comfortably, with an understated confidence throughout.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "Arrived at Manchester United with a growing reputation, supposedly the ace who was meant to right the ship and turn them into challengers once again. Instead, seven months down the line, he looks like little more than a busted flush. It’s going to take some turnaround next season to prove he isn’t just someone able to do it in a second tier league but found badly wanting in our top flight; the Ricky van Wolfswinkel of Premier League managers, if you will.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "For the majority of the season, has been on another level to the rest of the Premier League. Hat tips to Newcastle’s Alexander Isak and Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who doesn’t get anywhere near the credit he deserves.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Pau Cubarsi",
      "OK it’s not the Premier League, but for the Barcelona defender to do what he’s done in his first full season at senior level, to play as many games, with seemingly a different partner every other week - not to mention in Hansi Flick’s ridiculously aggressive defensive line - all at the age of 18 is nothing short of incredible.",
      "Biggest disappointment: West Ham",
      "It couldn’t be Manchester United, because seeing that level of failure while Sir Jim Ratcliffe sacks staff left, right and centre while pleading poverty at a club with revenues the size of theirs isn’t a disappointment.",
      "Tottenham save themselves thanks to their Europa League triumph and Joao Felix doesn’t get picked either because I’m still uncertain if he’s a beautiful mirage or not.",
      "So I’ll go with West Ham. Julen Lopetegui spent a lot and some of his press pals gave it the big build up - then continued to make clear how right he was and how it was everybody else who was wrong as things went from bad to worse. It's not got much better under Graham Potter either.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "In these days of everyone wanting defenders who can play, it’s good to see a big solid unit just being absolutely dominant in his own box and defending like his life depends on it. Has been brilliant for Forest for only £12million.",
      "Worst transfer: Riccardo Calafiori",
      "He cost £47million when they already had two left-backs - and then had Myles Lewis-Skelly coming through anyway! He’s not a bad player the Italian, but it wasn’t necessary from Arsenal when they had obvious other needs.",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning the FA Cup",
      "Quite simply what football is all about.",
      "Team of the year: David Raya; Daniel Munoz, Nikola Milenkovic, Virgil van Dijk, Marc Cucurella; Alexis Mac Allister, Bruno Guimaraes, Declan Rice; Mo Salah, Bryan Mbeumo; Alexander Isak",
      "Best manager:",
      "It’s got to be Arne Slot - he had the good sense to leave the side he inherited from Jurgen Klopp alone, like Claudio Ranieri inheriting Nigel Pearson’s team at Leicester in 2015, and they both won the title unexpectedly.",
      "Worst manager:",
      "In a crowded field, it’s got to be Ruben Amorim - not just for finishing the season without a trophy at Manchester United, but his refusal to adapt that sacrosanct 3-4-3 formation. Systems don’t win football matches, players do. Stick to your principles or stick ‘em in the bin? Amorim’s given us all the answer.",
      "Best player:",
      "Mo Salah - the Egyptian king’s contract stand-off at Anfield was a distraction from his 29 goals and 18 assists. Absolutely phenomenal.",
      "Best breakthrough season:",
      "Dean Huiijsen - if you’d never heard of him before this season, he was the £50 million defender snapped up by Real Madrid after an impressive season for Bournemouth.",
      "Biggest disappointment:",
      "West Ham - a wasted season. Julen Lopetegui wasn’t an obvious fit at the Taxpayers Stadium and his results soon showed why. In a year when Tottenham and Crystal Palace won trophies, the Hammers weren’t even at the races.",
      "Best transfer:",
      "Nikola Milenkovic - he brought steel and assurance to Nottingham Forest’s unlikely pursuit of Champions League football. OK, they ended up in the Thursday Night Smorgasbord Conference, but at £12m he was a steal.",
      "Worst transfer:",
      "Raheem Sterling - his season on loan at Arsenal yielded a solitary goal, against Bolton in the League Cup, and he spent most of it on the bench. At Euro 2020 he was England’s best player, but his star has fallen so far even astronomers can’t find it in the solar system now.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser for Everton in the last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Bedlam, controversy, madness, passion. All the things we love about football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Rice, Gravenberch, Guimaraes; Salah, Isak, Eze.",

      "Team of the year: Raya; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Rice; Salah, Wissa, Isak",
      "For all the impressive work done by some of the Premier League’s surprise packages this season, it’s hard to look past dominant champions Liverpool. In other years, Nuno Espirito Santo’s efforts might earn him manager of the year, but Arne Slot’s seamless work after following Jurgen Klopp earns him the nod.",
      "Forest do get a nod in my team of the year, with Nikola Milenkovic gelling brilliantly with Murillo in one of the most impressive defences in the league. Matz Sels and Chris Wood are also close to inclusion but just miss out, with Liverpool and Arsenal the only teams with multiple representatives - though it’s worth noting that none of Arsenal’s three are attackers.",
      "Former Manchester City youngster Morgan Rogers edges out his one-time Under-21s colleague Liam Delap in the breakthrough category by virtue of his Champions League exploits, but both have shown they’re more than ready to thrive at this level.",
      "The biggest disappointments - aside from PSG going three for three against English sides in the Champions League knockouts - are two Spaniards. Julen Lopetegui wasted a big-spending summer in his half-season at West Ham, while £49m Nico Gonzalez hasn’t even been Manchester City’s best Nico, let alone their best player.",
      "City’s title defence - or lack thereof - has been the story of the season. Rodri’s September injury accelerated their decline, and his return could yet be one of the factors when the time comes for end-of-season assessments 12 months from now.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "It is hard to look past a man who wins the title in their first season in the Premier League despite having made no major signings. Slot has led Liverpool roaring to top spot, easily handling the job of replacing Jurgen Klopp.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "At the other end of the scale, Ruben Amorim has been disastrous for Manchester United. He has won just six Premier League games, with a points per game average of 0.92. If he'd have been in charge for the full season, United may well have been in a relegation battle.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Once again, I'm going route one with this award. Mo Salah has been by far the best player in the Premier League this term. In a season in which his contract was expiring, Salah has delivered a historic performance, scoring 33 goals and notching 23 assists in all competitions.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "The 18-year-old made his debut back in September as a last second sub in Arsenal's draw with Manchester City. He has since become the Gunners' first-choice left-back and looks set to enjoy a successful career at the top level.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Phil Foden",
      "The reigning Premier League Player of the Year has endured a woeful season. He has scored just seven goals and notched only two assists in the top-flight. The midfielder looks far from the player many pundits wanted England to build their team around.",
      "Best transfer: Liam Delap",
      "OK so Ipswich went down, but Liam Delap has enjoyed an impressive season leading the line for the Tractor Boys. The striker has scored 12 goals and notched two assists. He looks likely to leave Portman Road in a £40m deal this summer.",
      "Worst transfer: Manuel Ugarte",
      "Bought for £50million, Manuel Ugarte has endured a difficult debut season in the Premier League. He has failed to solve United's midfield problems and has struggled to convince boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski's goal vs Liverpool",
      "With just seconds remaining of the final Merseyside Derby at Goodison Park, Everton were trailing 2-1. But then James Tarkowski smashed in a volley to equalise, sending the Toffees into delirium. It had the added benefit of ensuring that the Merseyside Derby record at Goodison Park ended up with 41 wins for each side and 38 draws.",
      "Team of the year: Matz Sels; Tino Livramento; Virgil van Dijk, Nikola Milenkovic, Milos Kerkz; Youri Tielemans, Declan Rice, Bruno Guimaraes; Mo Salah, Chris Wood, Josh Murphy",

      "It's sometimes forgotten in this era that a manager's job is to make the best of the players that he has and win games. For me, no one has done that better than Nuno Espirito Santo, doubling Nottingham Forest's points tally from last season, a Premier League first.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric",
      "I liked him in Italy but sorry, you can't escape his abysmal results.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Talismanic.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Ryan Gravenberch",
      "A lesson in not judging players too early. Good job for him that Liverpool never signed Martin Zubimendi.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Manchester United",
      "All change at the top yet the same mess on the pitch. But the Europe-less nadir that they've reached could actually force a hard reset.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "Talk about turning a profit, he cost Bournemouth £12.6million and was sold to Real Madrid for £50m just 34 appearances later.",
      "Worst transfer: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall",
      "Premier League-only, of course. Chelsea paid £30m for 258 minutes of football.",

      "Best manager: Arne Slot.",
      "Boring answer, but anyone who tells you they thought he’d win the league in his first season, with Federico Chiesa as the only summer signing is lying.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim.",
      "I bought into the hype, but it’s been a car crash so far – United’s squad is poor but he should’ve done far better and there have been some indefensible decisions along the way.",
      "Best player: Mohamed Salah.",
      "He’s tailed off a little of late – who can blame him? – but he’s been absolutely electric.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Jacob Murphy.",
      "At the age of 30, it has all clicked for the Newcastle winger, who is a lot better than I thought he was. A great story.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Southampton.",
      "Russell Martin’s style of play was always going to lead to some hairy moments, but they’ve been an embarrassment, plumbing the depths of Premier League history.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic.",
      "Everything you want from a signing: he was a bargain at £12m, has played every week for Nottingham Forest and been extremely consistent.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix.",
      "He cost £45m and has one Premier League goal. A player Chelsea didn’t need but went for anyway. A colossal waste who epitomises Chelsea’s buy now and question later policy.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski's last-minute equaliser vs Liverpool.",
      "A wonderful bit of unfiltered raw emotion in the last Merseyside Derby at Goodison Park.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Livramento, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Mac Allister, Rice, Rogers; Salah, Mbeumo, Isak.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Winning PL in first season is not to be sniffed at although if Nuno secures top-five, he’s my manager of season.",
      "Worst manager: Julen Lopetegui",
      "Shocking, should never have landed the job, wasn’t an upgrade on David Moyes.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Slowed down but in the thick of it, Salah provided big moments and put huge numbers on board again.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Liam Delap",
      "Always been highly rated but cracked the Prem to prove he belongs at this level.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Man Utd",
      "Ridiculous season having spent big again last summer.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "Bargain, colossal at the back for Forest, incredible business.",
      "Worst transfer: Sterling to Arsenal",
      "Spent a lot of time contacting people about this deal on deadline day and it was effectively much ado about nothing, really poor for all parties.",
      "Biggest moment: Palace winning FA Cup",
      "Not Prem related but a monumental achievement and underdog story that restores your faith in football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Munoz, Van Dijk, Milenkovic, Kerkez; Mac Allister, Rice, Gibbs-White; Salah, Mbeumo, Isak.",
      "Best manager: Oliver Glasner",
      "I know Arne Slot won the title in his first season but Oliver Glasner won Crystal Palace’s first trophy after 164 years.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric/Russell Martin",
      "Take your pick at Southampton but they had no chance of survival after one win in 16 under Russell Martin.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Honourable mention to Alexander Isak but Mo Salah has been different class.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "The Serbian centre-back has been an outstanding signing for Nottingham Forest.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Chelsea.",
      "A team of inexperienced players with an inexperienced manager.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen.",
      "Bought for £13m from Juventus and sold for £50m to Real Madrid after an excellent season at Bournemouth.",
      "Worst transfer: Raheem Sterling.",
      "Arsenal desperately needed a goalscorer. They took the Chelsea winger on loan and he scored one Carabao Cup goal in 27 appearances.",
      "Biggest moment: Liverpool 2 Man City 0 February 23.",
      "The official changing of the guard at the top of the Premier League.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Liverpool fans won’t like it but the fact that the Dutchman has won the title in his first season in England indicates that Jurgen Klopp might not have been the genius they claimed.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "An easy conclusion given that Amorim himself reckons he’s the worst manager in United’s history.",
      "Best player: Virgil van Dijk",
      "The Kop captain has been the rock on which the title success has been built.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "It’s always great to see a talented young player emerge at the club he supports. But Lewis-Skelly also has a bit of devil about him that makes him extra special. His Erling Haaland impression was a stand-out moment.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Refereeing standards and VAR",
      "And Howard Webb trying to suggest our officials are doing a good job is offensive.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "An absolute steal at £13m - and any club that meets his £60m buy-out will also be getting a bargain.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix",
      "Spending £46million on the Portuguese striker may have been driven by FFP and PSR considerations but has there ever been a bigger waste of money?",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning the first trophy in their history and what it meant to their fans.",
      "Team of the year: Newcastle edged out Nottingham Forest on the final day. For Eddie Howe to win the club’s first major trophy for 70 years AND qualify for the Champions League means he’s surely going to get a statue commissioned.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "There are other worthy contenders, such as Nottingham Forest's Nuno Espirito Santo and Newcastle's Eddie Howe, but to win the title in his first season at Liverpool, with effectively the same squad he inherited from Jurgen Kloop, was a remarkable achievement from Slot.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "Manchester United fans may sing his name and he may yet turn the club around in time, but seven wins from 28 Premier League games is shocking and would have seen them in danger of relegation in any other season.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "An obvious choice, but with 29 goals and 18 assists in the Premier League this season, a modern-day record for goal involvements, it is hard to look beyond the Liverpool forward as player of the season.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "He only made his first Premier League start in December, but the left-back, 18, has made the position his own and earned an England call-up with his fearless attitude and confidence on the ball.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Manchester United",
      "Even with the upheaval of changing managers mid-season, to finish 15th and lose 18 games is wholly unacceptable for such a big club, with the calibre of players they have and the financial resources at their disposal.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "The Serbia defender had an incredible debut season for Forest after signing from Fiorentina for £12million, forming a formidable central defensive partnership with Murillo and taking them to the brink of the Champions League, until the final day.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix",
      "Once regarded as one of Europe's hottest young talents, Chelsea spent £45m on the 25-year-old, who made three Premier League starts before being shipped out on loan to AC Milan. A calamitous and costly signing.",
      "Biggest moment: Manchester City's collapse",
      "Maybe not a single moment, more of a seismic spell, but City's return of five points from 27 from November 2 to December 26 was the shock of the season, given their relentless consistency of recent years, and ultimately handed the title to Liverpool.",
      "Team of the year: Liverpool",
      "Again, there are other worthy contenders, such as Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, but winning the Premier League at a canter, with a new manager at the helm, following a managerial icon in Jurgen Klopp, makes Arne Slot's side the team of the year.",
      "Best manager: It’s got to be Arne Slot - he had the good sense to leave the side he inherited from Jurgen Klopp alone, like Claudio Ranieri inheriting Nigel Pearson’s team at Leicester in 2015, and they both won the title unexpectedly.",
      "Worst manager: In a crowded field, it’s got to be Ruben Amorim - not just for finishing the season without a trophy at Manchester United, but his refusal to adapt that sacrosanct 3-4-3 formation. Systems don’t win football matches, players do. Stick to your principles or stick ‘em in the bin? Amorim’s given us all the answer.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah - the Egyptian king’s contract stand-off at Anfield was a distraction from his 29 goals and 18 assists. Absolutely phenomenal.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Dean Huiijsen - if you’d never heard of him before this season, he was the £50 million defender snapped up by Real Madrid after an impressive season for Bournemouth.",
      "Biggest disappointment: West Ham - a wasted season. Julen Lopetegui wasn’t an obvious fit at the Taxpayers Stadium and his results soon showed why. In a year when Tottenham and Crystal Palace won trophies, the Hammers weren’t even at the races.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic - he brought steel and assurance to Nottingham Forest’s unlikely pursuit of Champions League football. OK, they ended up in the Thursday Night Smorgasbord Conference, but at £12m he was a steal.",
      "Worst transfer: Raheem Sterling - his season on loan at Arsenal yielded a solitary goal, against Bolton in the League Cup, and he spent most of it on the bench. At Euro 2020 he was England’s best player, but his star has fallen so far even astronomers can’t find it in the solar system now.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser for Everton in the last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Bedlam, controversy, madness, passion. All the things we love about football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Rice, Gravenberch, Guimaraes; Salah, Isak, Eze.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "United's failure in the Europa League final means they missed out on the Champions League, which has massively hit their finances. It may hamper what they can do, but they are still tipped to pursue Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap.",

      "\"You know better than me that we have rules with FFP,\" Amorim said following the final match of the season. \"We can't change that in this year. We need to do something in the summer. We have a plan and we are doing that in a while. We also have a preseason to improve the players we have.\"",
      "Christian Eriksen has confirmed he will leave Manchester next month. The Dane will depart officially at the end of June when his contract expires. Eriksen marked his final appearance for the club by netting a penalty in their 2-0 triumph on the final day. He stepped off the bench in the second half and was given the opportunity to score in the closing minutes as he enjoyed the perfect send off.",

      "Ruben Amorim delivered an impassioned message to Manchester United fans after their 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford saw them finish in 15th - their worst ever Premier League finish.",
      "The Portuguese boss finished his difficult first season with a win as the Red Devils saw off Unai Emery's side. It came just days after they were beaten in the Europa League final, which curtailed their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Amorim has continued to speak candidly throughout the season, making some bold statements, including claiming he was managing \"maybe the worst Manchester United team in history.\" United have lost shy just of half of their league games.",
      "But the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss, who has continued to shoulder responsibility for the club's struggles, got on the mic after the full-time whistle and apologised to the fans for their dire campaign, but was adamant that good times were coming.",
      "Amorim said: “I want to apologise for this season. I know you are really disappointed with me and with the team. The second thing I want to say is thank-you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, which I know was really bad.",
      "“It was really hard in many games, but now, for me, we have to make a choice – stay stuck in the past - because this season is in the past, it's over. We fight each other or we stick together and move forward. Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you the storm is coming,",
      "“Today, after this disastrous season, I want to tell you - the good days are coming. If there is one club in the word that can overcome any situation, any disaster it is our club, Manchester United. I also want to say thank-you to my players. Sometimes I am not fair, but always I try to be honest with you. Thank-you very much, see you next season.”",
      "Amorim endured huge struggles after replacing Erik ten Hag. The 40-year-old's first defeat came at Arsenal in early December, before he went on to lose five times in a single month. In 2025 United have only beaten two teams outside the relegation zone.",
      "The Portuguese boss added: \"We are trying. We had momentum in other games like this. In the [Europa League] final, we were clearly the strong team. But sometimes we do not score. We had so many chances today. We are improving but we have a lot more to do next season.\"",

      "And just look that, it's all over. Manchester United's most horrendous of all seasons, their most dire Premier League campaign since the league's inception, is complete.",
      "My word how they'll hope there's no repeat. However, unless there's major, major change over the next three months to an unprecedented degree, next season may well be as much of a struggle as this one has been.",
      "Goals from Amad - one of their stars this season, enjoying a really smart breakthrough campaign - and a penalty from the soon-to-be departed Christian Eriksen, both late in the day, ensured the three points on a day where supporters protested outside the ground against the club's owners, the Glazer family and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, and Alejandro Garnacho was dumped from the squad, with his future now almost certainly set to be elsewhere.",
      "Amorim insists the Argentine will be part of the club's post-season tour and that he's still a Manchester United player. He may well head on the former, but whether he truly is the latter, we'll only find out when the August transfer deadline has been and gone.",
      "As usual, Bruno Fernandes played his part, his lovely chipped ball finding Amad for the opener against 10-men Villa, for whom Emi Martinez was sent off in the first half for what can only be described as a rush of blood to the head.",
      "That looked like being the day's main talking point in Manchester, the defining moment as the Villans missed out on a spot in the Champions League. But with the scores still goalless, and with less than 20 minutes remaining, it was rendered obsolete by the refereeing error that will leave Aston Villa furious.",
      "Morgan Rogers put the ball into the net but was deemed to have fouled goalkeeper Altay Bayindir in the build up. Referee Thomas Bramall blew his whistle very quickly - but it wasn't even a foul.",
      "And because Bramall blew his whistle, the decision couldn't be changed by the Video Assistant Referees.",
      "A statement from the Premier League Match Centre declared: \"The referee’s call was a free kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession. The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "Their fury was compounded by Amad and Eriksen's goals - the penalty decision for the latter leading Unai Emery to applaud sarcastically in his technical area. Emery followed the officials down the tunnel to vent his frustrations, unsurprisingly.",
      "One touching note in the second half came as Jonny Evans was brought on for his 241st and final United appearance. He's leaving at the end of the season when his contract runs out and looks likely to retire. Still, among many United fans, there remains puzzlement that Louis van Gaal allowed him to leave - for just £6million - to West Bromwich Albion when in his prime 10 years ago.",
      "He won't be a part of what Amorim hopes will be a new-look United next season. Nor will Eriksen, who confirmed post-match: “I wish Man Utd and the fans all the best. Incredible stadium and club, they will be back at the top at some point I’m sure.”",
      "They won't be the only ones.",
      "Amorim apologised to fans with his on-field address after the final whistle and vowed “good days are coming”.",
      "“I want to apologise for this season. I know you are really disappointed with me and with the team,\" said the Portuguese. \"The second thing I want to say is thank you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, which I know was really bad.",

      "Fifteenth in the Premier League and trophyless officially marks the worst Manchester United season in 51 years. In the end, their league position was better than anticipated.",
      "The unexpected final-day victory over Aston Villa saw United end an eight-game winless league run and rise to a flattering 15th. They even broke the 40-point mark.",
      "Although there is a post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong to navigate over the next week, the domestic season could not have ended quickly enough for United. Progression in the Europa League made the season salvageable but United lost to the worst Tottenham team since they were last relegated.",
      "Here are how the United players rated in 2024-25:",
      "Andre Onana",
      "It is easy to forget how secure Onana was in the first three months. That changed after Arsenal cornered him and he committed too many clangers, with the nadir away to Lyon. 4",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Played ten times and was the hero of the FA Cup triumph at Arsenal but he was almost always unconvincing, including in the only Premier League match United won with him in net against Aston Villa. 4",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Started to make some headway in March and early April but his form before then was nondescript. United missed him when he was injured but they need a new right winger. 4",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "One of United's most consistent performers. Mazraoui missed one game through illness and played in seven different roles. He is lacking in attack but is a valuable squad player in defence and provided value for money. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "On an individual basis, possibly his best campaign with United. Maguire scored huge goals, was more often than not solid defensively and has become a captain without the armband. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Struggled in his first six months but found form in March before he sustained injury at Nottingham Forest at the start of April, which effectively ended his season prematurely. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did not debut until December after he recovered from a metatarsal fracture but Yoro grew in confidence during the run-in and is an established starter in the back three. An encouraging first year. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Had a sloppy first half of the season but found form in January with some big goals and big moments. Then his season was over in February due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. 5",
      "Victor Lindelof",
      "Started 12 games in his least-involved season. Outstayed his welcome after United ill-advisedly triggered the one-year extension in his contract and United have paid millions to service Lindelof. 3",
      "Jonny Evans",
      "Barely qualifies as he started six games and made one substitute appearance in the final five months of the campaign. Was excellent in the goalless draw with Aston Villa. 4",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Amorim turned to him in the final month and that faith was misguided. Shaw missed seven months of football and was shoddy in the Europa League final. 3",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "The mid-season arrival had an enterprising few weeks in March and April but he suffered from Dalot's injury and failed to have any impact in United's remaining matches, despite starting regularly. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Had a handful of decent games and scored a couple of good goals but, for a 24-year-old, he has seldom looked ready to anchor United's midfield. His form was so poor in recent weeks he was benched for the Europa League final. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Went from redundant to relevant in the Europa League knockout stage, when he was totemic. That skews the perception of Casemiro, who had a forgettable domestic term. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Another injury-prone season was almost salvaged with a few goals and a start in the Europa League final. Then Mount reminded everyone in Bilbao why he and United have always looked a mismatch. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Lost his starting place a long time ago. He will always have the Lyon equaliser from his second full campaign but this has been one to forget for a player whose future is uncertain. 4",
      "Christian Eriksen",
      "Started 19 games in a season that was destined to be his last at United. Eriksen scored five goals but his only one in the league was the final-day penalty against Villa. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "The turning point for Fernandes was his red card at Wolves on Boxing Day. Before then, he looked like another United player who had eased up after signing a new contract. In 2025, he has been such a driving force that comparisons with Bryan Robson are legitimate. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Might have been United's player of the season but for his two-and-a-half-month lay-off between February and May. Tallied 11 goals and came up with memorable moments against Manchester City and Southampton. 8",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Has become a borderline cult hero since his 33rd-minute withdrawal against Newcastle. Zirkzee rallied in 2025 and produced good performances in a more withdrawn role. But he is not a striker. 5",
      "Alejandro Garnacho",
      "Not got anywhere near the highs of 2023-24 in a season of personal lows. Garnacho has done decently for a 20-year-old adapting to a new system but he has often been juvenile and crossed his head coach one too many times. 6",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "After his matchwinning goals in Plzen on December 12, Hojlund scraped three goals in 35 matches. Hojlund scored 10 goals and only four of them were in the Premier League. Drained of confidence and not good enough. 3",
      "Players must have started at least five games to be eligible for a rating. Loanees are excluded."

United bought 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro in a €70m deal from Lille in July while Amad signed a five-and-a-half-year contract in January. Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven only joined in the winter transfer window.",

      "This time, the ball did. For the first time in 346 minutes. Amad's cushioned header ended an eight-game winless run in the Premier League. Manchester United hit Emiliano Martinez, posts right and left, the crossbar and anything either side of the goalframe. Amorim kicked a water bottle, Casemiro kicked the post. Amad used his head.",
      "They even scored again. Soccer Aid is not until next month yet Ruben Amorim made some charitable selections and Bruno Fernandes made a charitable decision. He let Christian Eriksen take the 87th-minute penalty that confirmed Aston Villa's defeat.",
      "United's first league win in two months was procured by their two best players of the season, Fernandes crossing for Amad. The Stretford End willed Fernandes to take the penalty, perhaps anticipating a valediction from the captain. The three points took United past the 40-point mark and up to a flattering 15th.",
      "Champions League-chasing Villa were outplayed before and after they became a man light. Teams have beaten United without performing this season. Villa were beyond bad when victory would have secured a top five finish.",
      "\"Champions League, you're having a laugh,\" chuckled the United fans as Villa ended the season in sixth. \"Premier League, you're having a laugh,\" came the reply.",

      "Martinez goaded the Stretford End in 2021 with a schadenfreude jig after Fernandes skied a penalty. Many in there had not forgotten that as they bid Martinez \"cheerio\" and offered some other forms of sign language.",
      "For nearly three years Martinez has dined off his World Cup final-winning save from the France forward Randal Kolo Muani. Villa fans serenaded the \"world's number one\" when Martinez has always had a clanger in him. He was culpable for Paris Saint-Germain's goals that ejected Villa from the Champions League.",
      "A burly United fan had some verbals with Villa staff who had the gall to dispute referee Thomas Bramall's decision. They did not part on an amicable note.",
      "Only three changes from the anaemic Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, with Altay Bayindir and Victor Lindelof recalled for probable farewell appearances, seemed insufficient from Amorim. Jonny Evans made a comeback appearance, his first in five months, before heading off into the sunset, bound for retirement.",
      "They are still playing 'Take Me Home' in between the teams' emergence and kick-off at Old Trafford. The first time United did that in September, Liverpool wiped the floor of them. The chorus was more funereal this time.",
      "Neither Alejandro Garnacho nor Luke Shaw were in the squad for different reasons. Neither were in the directors' box, either, as they each took a seat in their own hospitality boxes. Garnacho is unlikely to be seen at Old Trafford again after today, having been informed he was free to leave. Shaw's contract still has two years left to run.",

      "'We'll never die', a chant usually reserved for the dying embers of matches, reverberated around the ground in the 11th minute to try and banish the memory of Bilbao. Amorim's chant was aired soon after, albeit not heartily and a Villa attack quickly ended its rendition. The Stretford End sang it loudly in the second half.",
      "United were uncharacteristically enterprising in the opening minutes and Villa played as though daunted by the fact they had only won three times at Old Trafford in 42 years. That stat still stands.",
      "Villa were afflicted with stage fright all afternoon. Unai Emery was nearer the corner flag than the dugout during a stoppage as he attempted to alert Ian Maatsen to the danger. The message did not get through, as Dalot ran off Maatsen soon after yet attempted to cushion the ball into Hojlund's path when he was one-on-one. Maatsen clumsily conceded the late penalty by treading on Amad.",
      "The away section was one of the quietest all season until word reached Villa's followers that Newcastle United had gone behind, briefly elevating them to fifth again. Villa fans could not even summon the energy to renew their enmity with Fernandes, an antagonist on the basis of a penalty he was awarded at Villa Park during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Martinez's red card only fuelled the dread among the Brummies. Villa were so harmless that Bayindir had to run around to stay warm in blustery conditions. Bayindir will have been hot under the collar after he fumbled the ball under the advances of Morgan Rogers, who scooped the ball in.",
      "The referee blew for a foul. The replays suggested Bayindir did not have the ball. Minutes later, the ball was in the back of the Stretford End net through Amad."

He was incredibly fortunate when referee Thomas Bramall blew his whistle prior to Morgan Rogers capitalising on Bayndir's error with VAR therefore unable to get involved.

      "Rasmus Hojlund won the foul to get the clumsy Emiliano Martinez sent off just before half-time, and had the ball in the net when play resumed, only to be flagged offside, but it was a surprise to see him in the team. Hojlund has been toothless in front of goal this season and probably wouldn't have scored.",
      "Amorim rolled the dice with the Dane in the Europa League final, despite Hojlund performing poorly against Chelsea, and the United boss had nothing to lose by giving Chido Obi his first Old Trafford start.",
      "United will sign a new striker in the summer and it would be a huge shock to see Hojlund start the opening game of the 2025/2026 season.",
      "The other starters against Aston Villa will be safe from the axe by default. The reality is a radical squad overhaul won't be possible and many of the underperformers will remain.",
      "The outgoings could reach double digits - Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans came on from the bench in the second half and will both leave - and that might not be enough for Amorim.",
      "United have suffered their worst campaign in the club's modern history and heads will roll from the playing squad, but everything must be done to keep Bruno Fernandes.",
      "There are question marks around almost every player's form this term, but not Fernandes, who played a wonderful cross to Amad and passed the penalty to Eriksen as a miserable season ended on a positive note."

      "Gyokeres has been a key figure for Rui Borges this season, helping them to another league title. His 39 goals in 33 league games this season, emerging as one of Europe's most-prolific goalscorers.",
      "On Sunday, Gyokeres played what could have been his final game for Sporting against Benfica. After falling 1-0 down to Orkun Kokcu's opener, Gyokeres stepped-up and scored from the penalty spot in the 11th minute of added time.",
      "Sporting went on to win the game with Conrad Harder and Francisco Trincao netting in extra-time. The victory means the Portuguese side have completed the double this season.",
      "Speaking after the win, Gyokeres continued to remain tight-lipped on his future. Asked about what lies ahead, he said: “I don’t know anything, I tried to focus on the last few games, if something is true, we’ll see.”",
      "His comments came after he refused to get involved in transfer talk with an interview with Portuguese TV channel SIC Noticias. “We’ll see. It’s the future. Football is like that, you never know what’s going to happen,\" he said. \"As we saw this season, you never know what’s going to happen. And it’s the same thing now.

      "This disastrous season has shown the majority of players in the dressing room are not good enough to represent United and the squad must be gutted in the summer. It will be pointless to start players against Aston Villa who are likely to leave and a handful of debuts should be handed out.",
      "Fans would rather watch academy prospects give their all against Aston Villa than players who have been responsible for this season, and it will be the only interesting aspect of the game.",
      "Bendito Mantato, Jaydan Kamason and Godwill Kukonki are obvious candidates to make their debuts after spending time around the first-team, but others could be involved as well.",
      "Chido Obi should also be given his first start at Old Trafford after making substitute appearances. Amorim has described Obi as \"naive\" on two occasions, but nothing can be lost by starting him.",

      "Amorim is an impressive communicator, but results have certainly not been impressive since his appointment in November. It will be fascinating to see whether Amorim picks up the microphone and what he says if he does.",
      "Is there much for Amorim to add after a bleak campaign? He's probably said it all in press conferences and interviews, and might feel it's best to avoid a speech on Sunday.",
      "The players usually applaud each corner of Old Trafford to thank supporters after the final home game of the season, but there might not be any fans remaining in the stadium to applaud.",

      "The fans who actually decide to stay will be angry and it could become pretty toxic.",
      "The anger among supporters is also expected to be palpable before kick-off, as a protest against the Glazers has been organised by The 1958. Avram Glazer sat alongside Sir Jim Ratcliffe to watch the Europa League final in Bilbao on Wednesday and removing the American family remains the target for fan groups.",
      "The 1958 have reiterated they want the Glazers \"out\" because \"they were never welcome\", and fans have been asked to join the fresh protest against the Glazers before the Aston Villa game.",
      "There should be a healthy turnout for the protest, especially after the Europa League final, which had the potential to paper over the cracks and influence fan sentiment toward ownership.",
      "United have suffered a staggering 20 defeats in all competitions this season, which is their most in a campaign since losing 22 in 1973/74, when they were relegated from the top-flight.",
      "Amorim has amassed several unwanted records during his first season in Manchester and could make more history against Aston Villa. For example, United last suffered four league defeats in a row the same season in February 1979, and they could do that for the first time in 46 years on Sunday.",
      "United could also lose as many as half of their league games in a season for the first time since 1933/34 when they were in the second tier. They last did so in the top flight in 1930/31."

      "After a bright cameo in Bilbao, Garnacho lamented United's \"s**t\" season and questioned Amorim's decision to bench him. The 20-year-old added \"we'll see\" when his future was raised. Garnacho's brother, Roberto, claimed he had been \"thrown under a bus\".",
      "When asked about Garnacho on Saturday, Amorim said: \"I always speak to my players, but the focus now is on the last game. I don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"We have a plan and we prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without. We have an idea what type of squad we want, but now we have to focus on the last game and we will have time address all of those situations.\"",
      "United rejected a £40million offer from Italian champions Napoli for Garnacho in the winter transfer window and he is under contract at United until 2028. The club is expected to hold out for a higher fee than what Napoli offered.",
      "Garnacho was listed among a handful of United players not for sale last year but the arrival of Amorim has largely worked against the Argentina international. Garnacho has started 25 times under Amorim and made 15 more appearances off the bench.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho and Marcus Rashford from the Manchester derby squad on December 15 on account of their attitude. Rashford has not played for United since but Garnacho was picked in every matchday squad.",
      "After Garnacho was substituted in the first half of United's win against Ipswich Town in February, he headed straight down the tunnel. Amorim later said Garnacho had offered to pay for a team dinner by way of an apology.",
      "Until the 1-0 defeat at Chelsea last Friday, Garnacho had not started two successive games on the bench since January. The return of Amad from injury and prominence of Mason Mount convinced Amorim to start them ahead of Garnacho in the 1-0 loss to Tottenham.",
      "As recently as two weeks ago, Garnacho flanked Amorim at the pre-match press conference for United's Europa League semi-final second leg with Athletic Bilbao. Garnacho started in all six knockout ties before the final.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" Garnacho complained on Wednesday. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Garnacho has operated as one of the two playmakers in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and United expect to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Mount, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo are among the other existing options.",
      "United co-chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe said in March no player would be sold for financial reasons when the futures of Garnacho and Mainoo were raised. Garnacho would represent a pure profit for United under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules, having come through their academy.",
      "Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid at the age of 16 in 2020. He scored seven goals, including two in the final, of their last FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022 and made his first-team debut in April of that year under Ralf Rangnick.",

All the hot takes by bright-eyed young things who think they’ve discovered the motherlode of wisdom, you heard 55 years ago when Sam Leitch presented Football Focus and it was called Football Preview.",
      "I say this not to pretend to be a font of knowledge but to illustrate the folly of thinking anything is wholly original.",
      "So you have to be careful not to patronise or be sneery. We were all young once and did the same thing. We’ve all been there.",
      "It does drive you crazy though when someone spells out something incredibly simple like it’s the most original thinking that you must have ever heard. This is doubly the case when they assume, wrongly, that you are a type that they’ve invented for themselves that they think defines your generation and that you must inevitably align.",
      "An example concerns Manchester United being relegated. Seen it, done it.",
      "I was 13 the last time Manchester United were relegated and though young Johnny had other pressing trouser-based concerns at that age, I remember how apocalyptic it was thought to be at the time. In fact the reality was it was all pretty painless. Next season they lost just seven games and won the second division easily by three points in front of Villa and Norwich; but what would happen now that they’re in even worse shape?",
      "The way Sky talk about relegation you’d think it was one of Dante’s seven circles of hell, at least until they want to show all their matches in next season.",
      "It’s all part of the ongoing project to establish the Premier League as an island of irresistible brilliance worth paying for.",
      "Fewer and fewer believe this, of course and they’ve had to play their last hand of cards of showing ever more games to try and shore up the creeping realisation that it’s just football and the fun doesn’t match the hyperbole and daily dance, no matter how many games they show. Imagine the hysteria which would accompany relegation this time? This is Manchester United we’re talking about, Kelly.",
      "Let’s say next season is a disaster too. It’s far from unlikely. Things are dire. Ruben Amorim is released from his waking nightmare at last  when he’s sacked in November and Malky Mackay is surprisingly appointed by Airhead Jim as an interim manager because he’s Scottish, cheap and swears like a Poundshop Sir Alex.",
      "His seasons at Ross County were thought to be a good grounding for the United role. But he’s obviously hopeless and they finish 19th on 26 points. What next?",
      "On the plus side relegation means they are now the big turd in a smaller bowl, financially dominant over everyone and at some point money must matter.",
      "We all know winning a lot, even in a lower division, is much more fun than losing a lot in a higher division. Obviously life is just better when you don’t play in the Premier League too.",
      "United get back to winning ways and storm the title. On top of that, they shed almost everyone on more than 50k a week, make a fortune selling off the failed ‘stars’ all of whom will be brilliant for someone else. They fill the squad with a mix of academy players and Championship grafters.",
      "The ridiculous bioform that is Scarecrow Jim finds out he hasn’t actually bought a biscuit business in Nice and leaves football in embarrassment, saying he is unable to associate his self-appointed undoubted brilliance with such failure. Similarly the Glazers decide second tier life is not for them and release the club from their icy death grip and let it be run by a fan’s trust. After a season out of the Premier League, they return refreshed and renewed, run on a different, less arrogant model.",
      "But on the other hand.",
      "It could all go wrong. The players are on long expensive contracts, no one will buy them and they won’t leave while they’re paid a million per month.",
      "Sponsors back out en masse, not wanting to stain their hard-earned noodle business’s reputation by being associated with a by-word for a poor brand.",
      "The academy has been denuded of funds over the years because the hollow-eyed ghoul just thought they’d buy talent in. Easy this football thing innit? And it is now rubbish and provides no new talent. Scarecrow Jim, anxious to prove he’s not actually a stupid, useless cu*t, stays on but sacks all remaining staff and saves enough to pay Bruno Fernandes’ wages for three days. Astute business. The Glazers continue to pay themselves millions in dividends, regardless, so much so that by spring 2027 the club is actually declared insolvent.",
      "So which way will it go? Relegation would likely be beneficial, as long as it alters the ownership and executive model and they are able to stop paying Antony’s wages.",
      "Go down and stay the same and worse will follow. It’s clear they are on a spiral of decline and that to break out of it, something radically different has to happen. With dreadful ownership, managerial performance and playing staff, it has to be imposed on them because they can’t be trusted to make a single good decision.",
      "Relegation would do that. If they don’t go down, they might be in the bottom six for a generation and be living proof of the stupidity of treating a club like a normal business and chasing money at every turn. When I was a kid Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Stoke, WBA and QPR were big, top flight clubs but haven’t been for a long time now. There’s your lesson, right there.",

      "Good process, boys\nJust when we’d thought VAR and Darren England’s infamous “good process” call last season summited the peak of PGMOL buffoonery, along comes Thomas Bramall to fly ever higher with relish. Take a bow good sir, you’ve single-handedly outdone all who’ve shat the sheets before you and I definitely know what your new crown is made of.",
      "I am nowhere near being a Villa fan and that left me seething.  A club’s entire trajectory has been knocked back because of one idiotic decision by an undercooked imbecile far, far out of his depth at this level.  And how in the world is Howard Webb allowed to continue his purview, overseeing such farcical degrees of incompetence with absolutely no accountability.",
      "Can’t wait to hear how Webb spins all this with another round of rehearsed, contrite bullsh*t followed by disingenuous babble in the coming days.  Such a comical way to end the season but not surprising in the least.\nEric, Los Angeles  CA  (Equally unsurprising that all of England’s traditional ‘big six’ clubs have once again qualified for Champions League football next term.)",

      "Firstly, having enjoyed a full season without the Stockley Park idiots, we then have to welcome them for the Champo final at Wembley. Without VAR, the Blades second goal stands as the ref allowed the goal, and in all probability, we go up to the Premier League. But no. In steps VAR and overturns the decision (correctly) and we manage to screw it up by sitting back and allowing Sunderland to win the game. Cost to United – around £130m as an estimate.",
      "Then we get the farce at OT when VAR cannot step in because the schoolboy running the game blew his whistle before Villa scored. What is the point of having VAR if a clearly wrong decision cannot be rectified? If that goal stands, then the probability is that Villa either win or hold out for a draw. Cost to Villa – around £100m as an estimate.",
      "That’s two incredibly expensive decisions influenced (or not) by VAR. They should be made to re-imburse Villa and should be barred from all future play off finals where teams are used to not having the interfering prats doing all they can to rule out goals. Leave it to the ref and the lino’s.",
      "At first, pretty peeved that we didn’t make it 10th time lucky in the play-offs (lost the previous 9), but on reflection, I think we may have swerved another season of misery and frustration dealing with VAR decisions. Good luck to the Black Cats – they are going to need it – but I think I’d rather enjoy the game than put up with the VAR nonsense.",

Probably should have leveraged our undisputed red bias earlier in the season but I think Ruben just didn’t know our shirt allows us to rig all decisions and games in our favour. So while it hurts right now, just know that the prem needed us to finish 16th so everyone else can eat next year.",

Not bad for a group that a lot of UK media views as worse than the British Empire, Hamas and the CCP rolled into one.",

Trafford, Guehi, Asensio and Mbuemo would cost about £180m. Even if Paul Mitchell has to turn tricks down the docks to raise the money, they have to give Eddie the players he needs.

With a kind cup draw, a lack of injuries, and a rousing speech about landing in Melbourne aged 6 months and fighting 2 great white sharks…he could win another cup. He’s not going to win the league or champs league but it wouldn’t come be a surprise to see Spurs win the FA or League Cup.",
      "But that stubborn pr*ckliness that runs so deep. He can’t help the questions he’s being asked but has a way of making everything about him. That’s fine and quite entertaining if it’s a press conference but if it’s heated squabbles with fans or Micky Van der Ven’s hamstrings, that stubbornness is more damaging.",
      "The reassuring thing here is that Daniel Levy is the least sentimental man alive so when it comes to making the decision, there’ll be no..well..sentiment. Spurs were the favourites for the Europa back in September. In Levy’s snaky eyes he’s delivered what the bookies thought he should have done with the strongest squad in the competition.",
      "I was reticent about taking one of the managers from the Barclays emerging middle class, none of whom have managed in the Champions League. I think? But Frank has got some x factor. An ability to motivate players, classy football and a Slott-like levelheaded pragmatism which Levy once thought he was too good for. And bloody hell its going to be tested to the max. Egos like Romero seem to be headed for the door. Players like Guehi and Dibling are right up Frank’s street. Maddison will look at what he’s done to Mbuemo. Ben Davies will welcome him because that’s Ben Davies. He won’t make crap jokes about Lucas Bergvall missing school, he’ll turn him into the player he can be.",
      "The final and most important point here is what ENIC cares about. Money. That Europa win is going to make the managed discontent so much easier for the next year. The natives aren’t restless. Quite the opposite. The fans would love another cup or two and finish 8th or 9th ….the establishment want 5th and the riches that go with it. Frank is much more likely to deliver that…and that’s why he’ll be waved in in a week or so.",

      "The play-offs need to change\nWatching the conclusion of a very enjoyable Championship play-off final between Sheffield United and Sunderland on Saturday and I couldn’t help but feel sorry for the Blades. Not just in how they lost the game after being the better team, but the fact they finished a huge 14 points clear of Sunderland and receive no real advantage in the playoffs.",
      "The value of winning the game – whether it’s worth £150/£200/£220 million as Sky kept telling us – will sort Sunderland out for at least the next three seasons, in prize money and, when they inevitably get relegated, parachute payments. It also means Sheffield United have one final throw of the dice to get promoted, before they no longer receive parachute payments and have to sell assets and cut costs. With that in mind, it seems out-dated that this game is now a one-off event at a neutral ground, where inevitably the importance and pressure of the occasion narrows the quality gap proven by league position over a 46 game season.",
      "Sheffield United won 92 points in the season – finishing on 90 with the points deduction. This points total would have seen them promoted in 24 of the last 30 years of the First Division/Championship, and only the anomaly of the top two getting 100 points (first time that has happened) pushed them into third.",
      "Their reward for this finish is to play the 6th place team in playoff semi-final – Bristol City – who finished closer to the relegation places than to Sheffield United. You could argue that it shouldn’t be much of a contest (and wasn’t in fairness) but that’s still two additional games to navigate, usually to a team on a high after reaching the playoffs on the last day. Look at what happened to York in the National League. Their reward in the final for finishing 14 points clear of Sunderland? They got first pick of using their home kit in the final…which is only an advantage if both teams have the same colours anyway.",
      "Now, I’m not saying we scrap the play-offs as they are great value and provide entertainment towards the end of the season, but let’s take some inspiration from the National League and start rewarding league position a bit more. One-off games, favouring home advantage, with the 3rd place team automatically in the final, and 4th place in the semi-final, both given home advantage. Yes, no Wembley – sure, kept it for League One and League Two if you want to patronise fans with a ‘big day out’ but unless you’re a London or surrounding area-based team, it’s expensive for fans an often a nightmare logistically.",
      "Here’s my proposal for the revised Championship playoffs, based on this season’s table.",
      "Saturday after the season ends: Coventry (5th) vs Bristol City (6th) at Coventry Building Society Arena, Coventry",
      "Wednesday: Sunderland (4th) vs Winner of above, at Stadium of Light, Sunderland",
      "Saturday: Sheffield United (3rd) vs Winner of above, at Bramall Lane, Sheffield",
      "You’ll still get drama with the games being a straight shoot-out, but now league position is rewarded more with home advantage, whereas currently it’s not at all.",
      "But it won’t happen as the playoff final is too much of a cash cow for the EFL and the FA, and after all, isn’t that what football is all about",
      "P.S. Faily scandalous that VAR isn’t used at all in the season, not even the playoff semis, but is in the final. Both managers were right to call it out and once it again it’s taken the headlines.\nJim",
      "",
      "Chantz bantz\nStrong rumours of Man United interest in signing Cunha and Mateta for next season.  This could mean no worries for the rest of our days, and an epic terrace song.\nRed Jim",

      "Fair to say there have been Premier League final days with more riding on them than this one, but we still had a fascinating and ultimately wildly controversial scrap for Champions League places and Spurs completing their unimprovable banter season in perfect 10/10 fashion.",
      "",
      "1. No doubt about the biggest talking point of the final day. With the European battle the only thing of significance to be decided beyond gauche money-counting and just-above-the-relegation-zone banter, we were left with four games that mattered, and one of them turned decisively on what is sure to end up as one of the worst refereeing f*ck-ups of the campaign.",
      "Ten-man Aston Villa – more on that very shortly – were holding on to a point with something approaching unbecoming desperation against a Manchester United side starting to wonder if they would in fact ever score a goal ever again.",
      "Then it seemed things had got even better for them as Morgan Rogers pounced on Altay Bayindir’s howling failure to pick up the most straightforward of loose balls. Rogers duly rolled the ball into the net, only for the referee’s whistle to sound before it crossed the line.",
      "The significance of that was that it left VAR powerless to intervene and correct such an obvious mistake.",
      "Bayindir being preferred to Andre Onana in the wake of Wednesday’s night’s Europa League misery was always likely to become a talking point but few could have imagined it becoming such a decisive moment in how the entire final day panned out.",
      "",
      "2. And that’s because even a point looked to be enough for Villa to get themselves back into a tournament they played such a fine part in this season.",
      "And were it not for that officiating error they would surely have got it against so bereft a United side.",
      "Yet just minutes after Villa were robbed they neglected to mark Amad Diallo as he headed home United’s first Premier League goal at Old Trafford since Bruno Fernandes gave them the lead on the stroke of half-time against Arsenal in early March.",
      "A late Christian Eriksen penalty wrapped up the points for United, who had been the better side when Aston Villa still had 11 players and had utterly dominated – albeit with a very familiar absence of cutting edge – once the visitors were down to 10.",
      "Villa’s fury at the refereeing blunder that has cost them is righteous, but honest self-reflection will also inevitably lead them to examine their own individual errors and more general lack of verve in such a massive game.",
      "After a quarter-final exit in the Champions League and semi-final exit in the FA Cup, it has been a nearly season for Villa. Not a failure, yet not quite a success. And that’s a feeling exacerbated by the likes of Palace, Newcastle and Spurs shedding the ‘nearly not quite almost’ tags they’ve carried for decades.",
      "",
      "3. A word on the biggest individual error. Yet another rare blunder from Emi Martinez, the former Best Goalkeeper In The World who has endured a torrid season.",
      "He saved the worst for last with a ludicrous red card at Old Trafford. While Matty Cash’s underhit backpass did him absolutely no favours the keeper’s response was a complete brainfade.",
      "Even if we stop to ignore the sheer guileless obviousness of the most clear-cut attempt to deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity with not even a hint of regard for the ball, we cannot overlook the fact that this brazen foul and its inevitable outcome was committed on Rasmus Bloody Hojlund in a position where there was still a great deal of work left to turn opportunity into goal.",
      "If ever there were a striker against whom this kind of reckless desperation was unnecessary, it is surely Hojlund.",
      "Even had it been the final minute of the second rather than first half it would still all have seemed a bit unnecessary.",
      "And it points to a keeper whose brain is not where it ought to be. At his best Martinez was a keeper who would back himself one-on-one with anybody. Now he suffers total panicked collapse at the sight of Rasmus Hojlund. How far he done fell.",
      "",
      "4. With Villa’s combination of self-sabotage and infuriating misfortune handing Manchester United a vaguely positive end to a season of utter misery, Newcastle were able to stumble into the Champions League for the second time in three seasons despite ending their own campaign with a 1-0 home defeat to Everton.",
      "On another day, this was a result that could have left the season with a very different feel for Newcastle. An anti-climactic ending to a campaign of such joy. As it is, a season already secure in its place as one of the most memorable in Newcastle’s history gains another burnishing flourish.",
      "The Carabao victory with its accompanying release of drought-ending emotion feels both an age ago and curiously quaint now, it having been upstaged not once but twice by Crystal Palace and Tottenham pulling off similar tricks in superior competitions, but its significance and impact on Tyneside remains quite rightly undimmed.",
      "And the fact Newcastle were able to combine the catharsis of silverware with a rock-solid league season bodes well for the future. The next step is to make a more memorable stab at the Champions League than their unfortunate 2023/24 effort.",
      "",
      "5. The one team who never appeared in any real final-day danger of missing out on the Champions League was Manchester City, predictably and dare we say boringly taking care of business at Fulham.",
      "They were, entirely obviously, the team who could least afford to miss out; the one for whom such a misstep would represent unfathomable failure.",
      "Theirs was the most straightforward of the final-day tasks and they were the first movers of the final day with a nerve-settling opener after 20 minutes in West London. It remains, though, a bare minimum achievement at the end of a thoroughly trying and challenging season, one that ended without silverware – for the first time since Pep Guardiola’s first season – and for the first time in years a sense of on-field uncertainty to match the off-field noise that continues to swirl around them.",
      "",
      "6. Just before City scored their opening goal – the first of the day of any real significance – TNT Sport saw fit to put up the first ‘As Things Stand’ table of the day showing the current state of play for the teams third through seventh during their coverage of United-Villa.",
      "Surely this breaks all known ‘As Things Stand’ convention and the speed with which City subsequently scored a heavy punishment for their failure to hold their nerve just those few minutes longer.",
      "For the avoidance of any future doubt, an ‘As Things Stand’ might be acceptable on these occasions in the very first seconds of a match as a little reminder of what’s at stake but after that can only be deployed when there has been a material change to how things stand, accompanied – in accordance with the prophecy – by the commentator declaring ‘Long way to go, of course’.",
      "We trust this will be taken on board for next season.",
      "",
      "7. The other game that mattered greedily contained two teams with something to play for in Nottingham Forest and Chelsea. With a kind of grim joy-sapping inevitability it was the seasoned Champions League heads of Chelsea that prevailed over the upstarts who had done so much to make this season memorable but had faltered down the home straight.",
      "Chris Wood has had a stunning, career-best season but will now spend much of his summer thinking about the chance he missed when the game was still goalless. Such is football, such is life.",
      "Chelsea were by the end probably just about value for their win, and probably just about deserved the top-four place it gave them across the season as a whole, one that started and finished impressively but had a massive wobble in the middle.",
      "They remain less than the sum of their parts, but we guess that’s what happens when you spend a billion quid on seemingly random parts.",
      "",
      "8. Chelsea themselves provide the obvious silver lining for Nottingham Forest. While there is no denying the transformative potential lost by failing to hold a top-five position for just a little while longer, they also need look no further than today’s opponents to see the positive spin on today’s events.",
      "Forest now find themselves in a European competition that is enormously, tantalisingly winnable. Especially for two-time champions of Europe.",
      "And that positive spin really is needed only for today’s events. The season as a whole remains a triumph. If you told Forest fans back in August they would have something significant to play for on the final day of the season, today’s scenario is not the first that would have sprung to many minds.",
      "",
      "9. And the same applies to Aston Villa. That this Tottenham and this Manchester United were able to cut such a swathe through the Europa League should give Villans plenty to get excited about when the anger and frustration of today has died down.",
      "The damage to Villa’s long-term planning from today’s failure to secure back-to-back Champions League seasons is undeniable, especially for a club that has an alarming wage bill. But after a season watching first Newcastle and then Crystal Palace and then Spurs win silverware after long, long waits there has to be at least some small part of every Villa fan’s brain relishing the far greater chance they now have to get themselves a slice of that action.",
      "And we’ll say it again: not one fan among those whose teams secured top-five finishes today looked anything like as deliriously happy about it as Spurs fans did on Wednesday, or Palace fans last Saturday, or Newcastle fans back in March. No reason at all that can’t be Villa a year from now.",
      "",
      "10. Everywhere else there was only league position or pride or banter to play for. The day’s biggest party atmosphere was found, of course, at Anfield where a fine time was had by all. Palace gave Premier League champions Liverpool a guard of honour.",
      "Liverpool gave FA Cup winners Crystal Palace a guard of honour. And Liverpool extended their generosity as hosts to handing Palace an early lead.",
      "We don’t quite share certain pundits’ anger at the way Liverpool have played out the last rites of this season after securing the title with so very long to go.",
      "With the absence of any cup football to keep them sharp, it was inevitable that focus and levels would fall slightly after so emphatically achieving their target and it doesn’t take much of a drop in standards to bring you undone in a Premier League that might not have boasted the same quality of challengers to the title winners as recent years but contained unprecedented depth once the promoted trio had been cut adrift.",
      "Still, though. Not ideal to lose all momentum quite so dramatically in the final few weeks of the season.",
      "While they’ve been hugely impressive and worthy Premier League champions this season, we still require some convincing that Liverpool are any more than that. That Slot’s Liverpool might be at the start of an era of huge Premier League success.",
      "A big summer awaits Liverpool with significant incomings and at least one very significant outgoing – one who received a far kinder reception when introduced as a substitute during today’s party atmosphere – and care must be taken not to allow the understandable fashion in which they’ve closed out this season to bleed into the next.",
      "",
      "11. One thing that will bleed into next season – and one that will bite Aston Villa on the bum too with Martinez – is Ryan Gravenberch’s three-match ban for a straight red card minutes after he was shuffled in to emergency centre-back deployment as Liverpool chased the game.",
      "Given how little really rode on today’s game, that was perhaps a risk too far from Arne Slot even if the equaliser duly arrived from Who Else But That Man Mo Salah as he firmly rubber-stamped his own long-inevitable individual honours at the end of a spectacular campaign.",
      "",
      "12. Liverpool were chasing the game because of an early Palace goal on the back of a Conor Bradley error.",
      "Fair to say that however unimportant the game might have been in the wider scheme that of all the Liverpool players to have a final-day moment like that, Bradley is perhaps the worst.",
      "We feel a bit for Bradley. He’s a player of real talent and huge promise but also one upon whom all manner of unfair hopes and expectations and baggage are now being projected.",
      "We get why Liverpool fans would love Trent Alexander-Arnold’s heir to be another homegrown academy graduate. But that is also just statistically an unlikely thing to happen. Maybe in time Bradley will prove himself worthy, but the talk that he is already some kind of ready-made replacement for the departing TAA is for the birds.",
      "",
      "13. So, Spurs. Brilliant – 10/10, no notes. We’d been very clear that we required whoever won the Europa League to finish 17th because that is so much funnier than 15th or 16th could ever hope to be, even though those are also very funny finishing positions for a Champions League qualifier.",
      "We were supremely confident in Spurs’ ability to deliver, and not just because we’d watched the parade on Friday evening and then seen how alarmingly many of those lads were in the starting XI here. Hats off to Brennan Johnson for playing all 96 minutes here after looking extremely tired and emotional by the end of Friday’s festivities. It’s great being young.",
      "No, the main reason we were supremely confident in Spurs is that we’ve also been watching them in the league all season. An early penalty for Dominic Solanke did briefly lift them as high as a profoundly unfunny 14th, but there was no need for alarm.",
      "Even without hangovers, Spurs had already once this season managed to comprehensively spaff away a half-time lead against Brighton and it had a sense of inevitability about it here from the moment a shambolically-defended corner allowed Jack Hinshelwood to equalise.",
      "When another uncleared corner led to a second Hinshelwood and Brighton goal, it was already a question of how many Spurs might concede as hangovers literal and metaphorical really kicked in. Superbly, the answer was in fact four, the last of which, in the very final minute of the season, was enough to at long last send Spurs’ gravity-defying goal difference into negative numbers for the first time in the entire season. Absolute poetry.",
      "Spurs have completed one of the funniest seasons in history and, while there was never any real scope for today to provide the funniest part of it, they could have done little more to give the season the ending it absolutely deserved.",
      "It’s hard to even imagine how any team could even begin to attempt a season more ludicrous than this one, but we also know if there’s one team that can pull it off, it is Tottenham themselves.",
      "",
      "14. After all, just like all TV shows (has anyone actually crunched the numbers on this, as an aside, because it feels like it’s surely a reach?) season three is better than season two. But as Ange Postecoglou himself pointed out, sometimes TV shows will kill off the main character.",
      "He was absolutely right to let Tottenham’s players enjoy Wednesday’s long-overdue success to its fullest, and his reasons for doing so were spot on: you have to make success like Spurs achieved in Bilbao as memorably enjoyable as you possibly can so that players are happy to, as Ange put it, climb the mountain again next time you ask them.",
      "As such it seems churlish to suggest that today’s frankly inevitable outcome – even the way the game panned out was on brand for both Tottenham and indeed drunk people with its early promise giving way to confusion and regret– might harm Postecoglou’s chances of getting that third season.",
      "It probably has, though. The sheer scale of the eventual defeat means it probably isn’t as shoulder-shruggingly irrelevant as it may first appear.",
      "Most obviously, it’s just not a one-off. It’s not even the first second-half collapse Spurs have suffered this season against Brighton. If what happened on Wednesday and Friday put some fresh doubts in the minds of Daniel Levy and the Spurs decision-makers, today might just have assuaged them.",
      "And brutal as it is, and as much as we have ourselves come round to the idea that Ange has now earned the right to fail properly here if that’s what he wants, he also can’t really have any complaints.",
      "Even allowing for the reasons Spurs completely sacked off the league campaign and the ultimate vindication of that approach, they were able to sack it off because it had already gone disastrously wrong.",
      "They have now set a record for the most defeats by any non-relegated team in a 38-game Premier League season, and finished the campaign five points closer to a historically bad bottom three than they did the top half.",
      "",
      "15. A significant win for Brighton, though, even if events elsewhere took away the last hopes that eighth place might bring with it European football.",
      "Results today falling in such a way that Brighton end up closer to the European qualifiers than any of their fellow mid-table overachievers (your Brentfords, your Bournemouths, the Fulhams of this world) might not mean a great deal but can shift the perception slightly on where they sit in the Premier League’s brave new world where Man United and Spurs can be this catastrophically bad.",
      "",
      "16. Arsenal at least managed to avoid repeating Man City’s trick of failing to beat Southampton. But only just, mind, and still find themselves confirmed as one of the Premier League’s worst ever runners-up.",
      "We still think when they buy a striker they win the league – the glibly simplistic take on this season that involves ignoring all manner of things such as Liverpool taking their foot entirely off the gas is that converting even half their draws into wins would have been enough to take the title – but for now they must accept their trophyless fate and role of punchbag as 17 years of frustration rushes out towards them from their neighbours.",
      "There’s no getting away from it at this time: whatever happens to any team in football, the joke is somehow always on Arsenal. Warra trophy."

It’s so so hard to take especially when the impact it has on us, as a club and a team, is so big. Its’ really, really tough to take and handle. I don’t think we deserved to win but if you were 1-0 up at that point and all you need is a point to get to the Champions League, it’s costly.",

Maybe we could look at having more experienced referees. I don’t know. It’s just an incredible decision and makes today even worse than it should be.”"

      "Man City’s vital win over AFC Bournemouth in midweek left them one step away from Champions League qualification and they got over the line, winning 2-0 at Fulham on the final day to finish third and only three points behind second-placed Arsenal.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s side were not made to sweat, but this cannot be said for the remaining four sides tussling for the other two Champions League positions.",
      "Nottingham Forest and Chelsea battled at the City Ground in an edgy shootout for Champions League qualification, with a win for either likely enough to seal a top-five spot.",
      "Unsurprisingly, this game was tight and lacked clear-cut chances, but Forest, who have somewhat run out of steam during the run-in, failed to produce one last great home performance as they came up short against Chelsea.",

      "The Magpies would have expected to slip out of the Champions League spots via a 1-0 home loss to Everton, but they finished ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference.",
      "Ahead of the final day, Villa won three consecutive games to boost their Champions League hopes, but everything went wrong against Man Utd as they lost 2-0 and finished the game with ten men.",
      "Potentially in his last game for Villa, Emiliano Martinez was sent off before the break for a challenge on Rasmus Hojlund and Man Utd controversially took the lead via Amad Diallo after Unai Emery’s side harshly had a goal chalked off for Morgan Rogers’ challenge on Alkay Bayinder.",

This result and Man Utd’s win sees Ruben Amorim move up to 15th, which is still embarrassing but not quite as bad as Spurs’ 17th finish, though that has admittedly been saved by their midweek Europa League triumph.",

      "Arsenal, 2024/25 – 72 points\nMikel Arteta knows better than anyone that “winning trophies is about being in the right moment in the right place,” and the points tally delivered in his fifth full campaign would not have been enough to secure the title in any Premier League season, moment or place.",
      "Arsenal fell only three short of matching the record for most draws in a Premier League campaign and converting less than half of those into wins would have been enough to pip Liverpool. It is weird that they didn’t simply do that.",
      "It is the next step and the hope is Viktor Gyokeres can help them take it, but Arsenal will need better luck with injuries and significant improvement away at sides in the top half to cross that championship threshold.",
      "",
      "Manchester United, 2020/21 – 74 points\nThe previous time Manchester United lost a Europa League final they could at least console themselves with a second runners-up medal in the Premier League. There was also an overwhelming sense that a change of manager was needed at Old Trafford then because some things never change.",
      "“No-one will remember how the league table looked like on the 12th of January in 2021,” was how Ole Gunnar Solskjaer grossly underestimated the recollective powers of a formerly good website. Manchester United were top, three points clear of Liverpool and a further four ahead of eventual champions Manchester City.",
      "Leicester, Everton, Spurs and Southampton were in the top seven; it was a wild time.",
      "But that was forever destined to be consigned to the realm of forgotten title challenges, an average second half of the season confirming the suspicion that this was not a team ready to break into the elite.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo was added to the ranks in a Manchester City-induced panic that summer and Solskjaer was sacked by November after they slipped to what do in 2025 seem the particularly heady heights of 7th.",

      "When Manchester United were crowned as the first champions of the millennium in late April, their eventual bridesmaids were not even in place yet. Liverpool were their closest contenders, with Arsenal six points behind and armed with two games in hand.",
      "The outlook was far bleaker for Arsene Wenger’s side at one stage. A 2-1 defeat to Middlesbrough in March left them fifth behind Leeds, Liverpool and Chelsea, nine points off second and what was the only other Champions League group stage qualification place, which was the style at the time.",
      "A run of eight straight wins thereafter bumped them into second, but still laughably far off that Manchester United pace.",
      "",
      "Arsenal, 2015/16 – 71 points\nThe miracle would not have been possible if just one of the traditional challengers had shown a modicum of competence. That is not to denigrate the ludicrous achievement of Leicester, but the inherent advantages boasted by the Big Six ordinarily prevent that glass ceiling from being broken.",
      "It required The Mourinho Year, transitional periods for both Liverpool and Manchester City, and Louis van Gaal to be stumbling through his second and final Manchester United season.",
      "That might have planted seeds and opened doors in north London but Arsenal remained painfully fragile and the opportunity came probably a year too soon for Spurs, who nevertheless put up the strongest resistance to Jamie Vardy and friends.",
      "It was Mauricio Pochettino’s side who pushed them the furthest, yet St Totteringham had his say on the final day to relegate Spurs to third place in a two-horse race, their greatest Premier League season to that point still behind one of Arsenal’s worst in years.",
      "",
      "Chelsea, 2010/11 – 71 points\n‘This season’s performances have fallen short of expectations and the club feels the time is right to make this change ahead of next season’s preparations,’ read a line in the Chelsea statement which confirmed what Carlo Ancelotti had been informed in a corridor at Goodison Park within an hour of the campaign’s climax: the Italian had been sacked.",
      "It was long held as proof of Roman Abramovich’s ruthlessness but it had been the worst season of his ownership by some distance. Chelsea had not dipped below 83 points since they had access to the Russian’s chequebook, and their only entirely trophyless campaign was the Avram Grant near-Treble in 2007/08.",
      "Ancelotti followed up a Double in his debut year with early exits in each competition, while a miserable winter cost the Blues in the Premier League. Chelsea only pipped Manchester City on goal difference after two defeats and a draw in their final three games.",
      "",
      "Arsenal, 2000/01 – 70 points\nOnly one team in Premier League history has finished runners-up in three consecutive seasons – and Arsenal have contrived to do it twice. Arteta truly is Wenger’s finest pupil.",
      "As risible as their aforementioned chase the prior season was, Arsenal were humiliated in surrendering the title to Manchester United yet again in 2000/01. Sir Alex Ferguson’s side had already occupied the summit for months with a commanding lead when they hosted their closest rivals that February, but a farcically one-sided win basically wrapped things up.",
      "“The only time Arsene lost it was when we got beaten 6-1 by Man United,” David Seaman later recalled. Having named a defence of Oleg Luzhny, Gilles Grimandi, Igors Stepanovs and Ashley Cole, it is unknown quite what else the manager expected. But it was at that point Manchester United started to phone it in, recording four of their six defeats that season in the final eight matches.",
      "The belated Arsenal response was resounding as the Gunners won the title in one of the most satisfying ways imaginable the following season.",
      "",
      "Newcastle, 1996/97 – 68 points\nThe lowest points total for a Premier League champion naturally facilitated the lowest points total for a Premier League runner-up. And Newcastle accrued almost a third of them during a winning run stretching across September and most of October.",
      "They were, for a while, the runaway Premier League leaders again. But their inevitable collapse was far quicker and more anti-climactic than in the prior season, with champions Manchester United top from late January onwards.",
      "Kevin Keegan resigned from his post at St James’ Park earlier that month but Kenny Dalglish held onto second place for dear life, pipping both Arsenal and Liverpool on goal difference courtesy of a final day 5-0 thrashing of Nottingham Forest – only their fifth win in their final dozen games.",

      "Man United’s Finances\nDear Editor,",
      "I am no financial mastermind but, after about an hour or so of fact finding, I can’t help reach the conclusion that Manchester United are in absolutely really big trouble.",
      "Over the past five seasons, United have sold at a rate of 25% of the full market value. From what I can see, they have sold £708.3M worth of talent for only £172.5M. This is astonishingly bad when compared to the likes of City, Real Madrid, and Benfica and even clubs like Brighton, Bournemouth, and Leverkusen.",
      "Over the past five seasons, United have bought at a rate of 65% of the full market value. From what I can see, they have bought £681.3M worth of talent against their value of £1,024.6B. However, their current squad is valued at £516.3M, so somehow the value of their current players has decreased by nearly exactly 50%. My goodness, that’s shocking.",
      "If they were to sell their whole entire squad at a rate that they’ve been going (25% of full value), they will only be able to generate £129.1M which is based on the above patterns over the past five seasons. The BBC have also recently reported that United owe £272M in outstanding transfer payments to other clubs, £156M of which is due this summer. It’s not a stretch of a conclusion to say that selling their whole entire squad would not see off this summer’s bill alone.",
      "(Source: transfermarkt)",
      "Changing tack, over the past five seasons, United have paid their players, and wait for this, a staggering £1,040.3B. This season, United’s annual wage bill is £173.8M, but their commitment to the current players full contract lengths is a colossal £567.7M in future salary spend.",
      "(Source: capology)",
      "At the start of the year, the BBC reported £370M losses for United (including £113M in 2024) over the last five years.",
      "To indicate the scale of the problem, this guy thinks that even selling a whole squad at a rate they’ve been going coupled with total TV/prize money for finishing 17th (£253.1M) is absolutely dwarfed by their reported losses in recent years and by already committed salary spend (£937.7M)",
      "FFP allows a club to be compliant by allowing losses of up to £105M over three years. Gulp. How they aren’t facing Manchester City level of scrutiny is beyond me.",
      "It’s one hell of a huge summer at Manchester United. If the future is bleak right now after the EUROPA League final defeat and sticking with a manager whose 3-4-3 formation is ill-suited to the Premier League and the players at his disposal, I think this could be just the start. The above indicates that United not only have to sell, but they have to sell at a 75% loss from transfer fees as well as hoping that buying clubs do not insist on United paying most of the outgoing player’s wages. And that’s just to avoid FPP sanctions if that is now even possible. Do not expect the ownership to gamble money they just don’t have on signings to keep them in the Premier League. Do not expect clubs to sell to United as they still owe transfer costs. Do not expect players to agree to move on without compensating the rest of their contracts. Expect to lose players for peanuts to offset this. Expect the club to make no new signings. Expect the club to rely on youth. Expect FFP points deductions. Expect relegation next season followed by the Championship.\nRich (let’s hope for a better season next season at The Hawthorns), WBA.",

He’s been a force of nature for us and we wouldn’t have won what we’ve won without him. I wish him all the best but not that bunch of whinging prancers he’s joining (sorry, that was childish).",

Not when there are so many more better, actual words, said with a hard ‘t’ to be employed, but never against my own players.

I don’t want the things I say to actually happen to them (I think). But, never do it to your own team (and I’ve followed Hodegeson & Konchesky’s Liverpool, the thoughts were dark). No excuse for booing TAA. He was and always will be a cast-iron LFC Legend. But I separate players from club and I’ve never wanted his sweaty match-worn shirt to cuddle up to at night, nor a beer-stained napkin with his moniker or even to ask him what his favourite colour is. Red right? Would I buy him a beer if I met him? Fuck that, he can buy me one. He’s on the big pay-day.",

The stripe treatment is really an elaboration of the 1995-96 grandad-collar kit, which featured a similar stitched-look border, and the subtle patterning of perforations (or black flecks) evident in the white stripes with the close-up shot on the club shop is rather cool.

I’ve seen a “deconstructed” monotone version of the current badge that would look very nice indeed. We may see two versions of this shirt if they make a decision soon.

      "We enter the final day of the 24/25 Premier League season with five teams separated by three points as they fight for three remaining Champions League places.",
      "You can check out the permutations here but what the neutrals really want is something that will fight its way onto this list of the greatest Premier League final days ever.",
      "This way for some dodgy lasagne, MOTD montages and Man City madness.",
      "",
      "10) 2005/06\nWhile it lacked that rich Barclaysian tapestry and depth, the final day of the 2005/06 Premier League season remains a vital cornerstone in the competition’s history.",
      "Chelsea had already successfully defended their title. There was vague interest as to whether Liverpool could finish ahead of Manchester United as runners-up, but mid-table Charlton popping up to Old Trafford meant it never seemed likely. Birmingham, West Brom and Sunderland had already succumbed to their fate.",
      "The remaining kernel of intrigue was being cooked up in north London – although speculation that it was by an Arsenal season ticket holder at the Marriott remains unfounded.",
      "The Gunners had reached the Champions League final that season but Tottenham were in control of qualification for the subsequent season’s campaign – and at this stage the outcome seems obvious. It was a tired and unimaginative reworking of the previous campaign’s plot, in which Everton pipped Liverpool for fourth but the Reds earned passage to the European Cup by winning it. But viewers were engrossed nonetheless.",
      "Spurs had a one-point lead heading into their final game, away at West Ham. Arsenal hosted Wigan in Highbury’s last match. It seemed like a straightforward sprint finish. But then Martin Jol had 10 players fall to illness overnight and his side went into disarray, slipping to a 2-1 defeat as the Gunners came from behind to win 4-2. Tottenham tried to have their match postponed, or at least kick-off pushed back a few hours on the same day. They then explored the possibility of a replay and considered taking the matter to court. Claims of food poisoning were thoroughly investigated. Callum Davenport, by his own admission gave “this whopper in a Chinese takeaway container” for a stool sample as part of an internal investigation.",
      "The eventual conclusion was that a bout of norovirus tore through the squad but the accepted conspiracy is that Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe and company were felled by a dodgy lasagne at the last hurdle.",
      "",
      "9) 1999/2000\nThe comprehensive story threads were once again absent as this final day essentially hinged on one fixture with two direct consequences. Liverpool had a first Champions League campaign within reach, occupying fourth place but sitting behind Leeds and what was then the third and last European Cup spot that could be secured through league position. The Whites traipsed up to face an exciting West Ham side of Ferdinand, Lampard, Di Canio, Wanchope and Lomas, returning only with a goalless draw which offered Gerard Houllier and his Reds an unexpected opportunity.",
      "All they had to do was beat Bradford, who had spent all but a single gameweek since the start of January in the bottom three. That mattered nought when David Wetherall thundered a Gunnar Halle cross past Sander Westerveld in the first half, nor when the Bantams defended manfully to keep Michael Owen and Emile Heskey out, with Robbie Fowler omitted from the squad.",
      "Liverpool made the best of an inexplicably bad situation, embracing their UEFA Cup consolation so much it comprised one third of the subsequent season’s technical Treble. Bradford went down with a whimper in 2000/01 by comparison.",
      "",
      "8) 2006/07\nThe agenda was again dominated by events at the lower end. Sheffield United started in 16th, ahead of West Ham, Wigan and the pair of Charlton and Watford, whose relegations had already been confirmed. Three points separated as many teams when it came to taking up the last place on the second-tier scrapheap – and two of them were playing each other.",
      "Sheffield United could have avoided defeat at home to Wigan to render moot whatever result West Ham achieved at Old Trafford. But Paul Scharner scored after 14 minutes at the DW Stadium to make matters that little more agitated. Wigan and West Ham were staying up. Then uncle Jon Stead’s brave header swapped the Latics with the Blades.",
      "As half-time beckoned across the country, Carlos Tevez soaked himself in narrative to the delight of Neil Warnock, sending the Hammers clear. It became a straight shootout between Sheffield United and Wigan, who regained the lead at Bramall Lane when Phil Jagielka handled the ball; David Unsworth, a Blade until leaving that January on a free, and who had missed a penalty in a 0-0 draw against Blackburn the prior September, beat Paddy Kenny from 12 yards in first-half stoppage time. Danny Webber hit the post when through on goal. Lee McCulloch was sent off with 16 minutes remaining. But Wigan endured to send an embittered Warnock down.",
      "",
      "7) 1996/97\nAnother Champions League implosion from Liverpool proved to be a satisfactory entrée to a relegation-centred main course. The Reds had been a point behind Manchester United with a four-point and one-game buffer to Arsenal by late February, but dreadful form down the final straight – P10 W4 D3 L3 F14 A14 – obliterated that advantage. Defeat at Wimbledon in their penultimate match meant both Arsenal and Newcastle had closed to within two points of second place and the only other European Cup qualification spot alongside champions Manchester United.",
      "Arsenal beat Derby; Newcastle pummelled Nottingham Forest and increased their superior goal difference. Liverpool needed to win at Sheffield Wednesday but went behind to O’Neill Donaldson in the 75th minute and could only pull one back through Jamie Redknapp. All three sides finished on 68 points but Newcastle ventured to the Champions League while Arsenal and Liverpool were headed to the UEFA Cup.",
      "Middlesbrough, Coventry and Nottingham Forest occupied the bottom three places, with Forest already gone. Only Southampton and Sunderland were in reach and the door was opened when they lost at Aston Villa and Wimbledon respectively. Boro could only draw against Leeds and were made to rue their January points deduction, but Coventry took full advantage of the circumstances by beating Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Traffic problems meant that game had to be kicked off 15 minutes later than the rest – Jimmy Hill must have been proud – and player-manager Gordon Strachan later claimed to be “too nervous” to play as he remained an unused substitute. It kept him fit enough to leap into the welcoming arms of Dion Dublin at full-time.",
      "",
      "6) 1993/94\nManchester City were 16th on 44 points. Southampton were 17th on 42. Sheffield United were 18th on goals scored. Ipswich were 19th on goal difference. Everton were 20th on 41 points. Oldham were 21st on 39. Swindon Town were gone.",
      "Everton were 2-0 down at home to Wimbledon after 20 minutes, their predicament seemingly unsalvageable. Oldham led Norwich after 14 minutes but their inferior goal difference required Southampton, Sheffield United and Ipswich all to lose heavily. Manchester City were dragged in that little bit closer when Sheffield Wednesday went 1-0 up. Southampton fell behind to West Ham. By half-time, Sheffield United were beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and had four points and three teams between themselves and Everton. Manchester City equalised for the point they needed at Sheffield Wednesday. Southampton would concede a late Lee Chapman equaliser at West Ham but were clear.",
      "But Everton staged an improbable comeback to lead Wimbledon, thus taking Ipswich – drawing at Blackburn – down with Oldham. The Tractor Boys could do nothing to affect their own fate as they laboured to a stalemate, yet two late goals from Mark Stein at Chelsea, the last in stoppage time, spared them and put Sheffield United into the relegation zone for the first and most crucial time on the final day.",
      "",
      "No team had been relegated going into the final day and two points separated Norwich, Southampton, Crystal Palace and West Brom. The Canaries tumbled down the mine and gave the rest a chance by capitulating at Fulham. The other three were staying up at various points across the afternoon. Saints were ahead against Manchester United but were pegged back and then lost. Palace came from behind to lead Charlton before Jonathan Fortune’s late equaliser. West Brom started the day bottom, were stranded at Christmas and needed the rest to slip up, but capitalised through Geoff Horsfield and Kieran Richardson in the second half against Portsmouth. Some Pompey fans filtered onto the Hawthorns pitch upon realising that their defeat had helped relegate Southampton.",
      "It was absolute perfection that almost overshadowed Stuart Pearce sending David James on up front instead of actual striker Jon Macken as Manchester City chased a result in a UEFA Cup decider against Middlesbrough.",
      "",
      "4) 2002/03\nOn the line this time was Roman Abramovich’s heart. The media had dubbed Chelsea and Liverpool’s Champions League qualification showdown as ‘the £20m match’ but that barely covered a fraction of what was ultimately on offer.",
      "The Blues were fourth and had the Reds pipped on goal difference heading into a ludicrously poised last match at Stamford Bridge – winner takes all. Chelsea faced financial ruin if they failed. Sami Hyypia opened the scoring but Marcel Desailly almost immediately responded. Jesper Gronkjaer completed the turnaround within the half-hour and in doing so, intrinsically changed Chelsea’s future.",
      "Blackburn secured a UEFA Cup spot ahead of Everton by beating Tottenham 4-0, while the Toffees inevitably lost 2-1 to Manchester United despite Kevin Campbell’s best efforts.",
      "In terms of relegation, West Brom and Sunderland were adrift. It became a case of one out of three joining them, despite Leeds, Bolton and West Ham all having reached That Magical 40-point Mark. Leeds beat Aston Villa 3-1. Bolton beat Boro 2-1. West Ham could only draw 2-2 with Birmingham as they became Too Good To Go Down poster boys.",
      "",
      "3) 2021/22\nA vintage slice of final-day Barclays. Manchester City produced a title-winning conclusion mad enough to be the second maddest final day they’ve had, while Leeds leapfrogged Burnley to avoid the drop and, most astonishingly of all, Spurs never even threatened to Spurs things up for a single second as they cruised back into the Champions League.",
      "Of course, most eyes were fixed on the Etihad when all they had to do, with a one-point lead at the summit, was not balls it up against Villa. Not this brilliant Villa inspired by one of the greatest managerial upgrades ever; Steven Gerrard’s Villa. On paper, it should have been a procession. But City unexpectedly fell behind to Matty Cash and, while recklessly searching for an equaliser, they went 2-0 down thanks to Philippe Coutinho.",
      "Gerrard and Coutinho winning the title for Liverpool? Oh Lord.",
      "But Liverpool were struggling to take care of their own business. They were level with Wolves all the while City opened the door. Never once during the afternoon did the Reds move to the summit. By the time Mo Salah had come off the bench to put them ahead at Anfield, City had done a six-minute madness and the title was staying at the Etihad.",
      "The only significant last-day twist came at the bottom where Leeds, at Brentford, had to better Burnley’s result at home to Newcastle to leapfrog the Clarets and condemn them to relegation. Both games finished 2-1 in favour of Leeds, who went down with Sam Allardyce the following season anyway as Burnley climbed back up.",
      "",
      "2) 1994/95\nYou know exactly where this is going. It was, by definition of it subjectively being ranked second here, not the greatest of Premier League final days, but it was the first truly spectacular, fabric-altering one. It really was breathtaking when Brian Deane rifled in an excellent goal to equalise against Tottenham and secure the point Leeds needed to pip Newcastle to the last UEFA Cup place.",
      "There was a modicum of drama elsewhere. Jamie Redknapp scored a sublime last-gasp free-kick he dare not celebrate to beat Blackburn, the Premier League leaders who had been winning and heading for the title until John Barnes equalised in the 64th minute at Anfield. In doing so, Liverpool had betrayed club icon Kenny Dalglish and provided Manchester United with a gilt-edged chance.",
      "Alex Ferguson’s players had plenty of those against West Ham, of course. But let’s just say Ludek Miklosko need never buy his own pints in one half of Merseyside or Lancashire.",
      "",
      "1) 2011/12\nMartin Tyler receives some understandable criticism, such is his inherent bias against every team, but he absolutely nailed it here: that really was Aguerooooooooooooooo, and we surely will never see anything like this ever again. The most rudimentary explanation is that Manchester City had to only match Manchester United’s result at Sunderland when they hosted QPR to win their first Premier League title, and they did. That misses out a couple of key incidents and some absurd context but still.",
      "Chief conspiracy theorist Wayne Rooney covered the side of the bargain for Ferguson’s team with a routine back-post header at a pliably mid-table Sunderland. Pablo Zabaleta restored Manchester City’s advantage on goal difference with the opener against QPR. But Rangers, fuelled by a relegation battle and some residual resentment from manager Mark Hughes, sacked in acrimony by City two and a half years prior, took inexplicable control through Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie. It was the ultimate bottle job, until Edin Dzeko and some Argentinean fella staged a stoppage-time intervention.",
      "That alone would mark this final day out as the greatest. But there were layers playing out in the background, such as QPR staying up despite their own implosion and being able to freely celebrate with Manchester City as Bolton succumbed to a 77th-minute Jon Walters equaliser at Stoke. Arsenal gripped on to third place for dear life ahead of Tottenham, although it wasn’t until Chelsea won the Champions League six days later that Spurs learned fourth was only good enough for the Europa League. Because Spurs."

      "With season’s end now just around the corner, here’s a look at five managers who aren’t certain to take charge of their current clubs in the Premier League next campaign.",
      "Full disclosure: this has been quite significantly rewritten since we first had the idea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nObviously and entirely a madness, this one, and perhaps the single most egregious example of a manager becoming the victim of his own success at any non-promoted side. Even Leicester waited until it actually had gone to sh*t to get rid of Claudio Ranieri after he delivered the title.",
      "Yet there is plenty of talk now that should Nottingham Forest end up seventh when the music stops on Sunday afternoon then Nuno’s position could come under threat.",
      "There is absolutely no denying that finishing ‘only’ seventh from where they were a month ago would represent a disappointment and opportunity missed, but even allowing for the inevitable shifting of targets and expectations it seems utterly wild that Nuno could come under any pressure at all after a season that in the round remains a huge overachievement for a team that spent much of the last one in dire relegation trouble.",
      "But the fact it would be batsh*t doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Easy to forget it for much of this season, but Forest are quite batsh*t. Nuno is their eighth permanent manager in the last decade and already the second longest-serving.",
      "Owner Evangelos Marinakis is an emotional and volatile guy, and we’ve already seen him storming the pitch, brandishing his iPhone 7 and wired earphones, to admonish Nuno in the most public fashion possible after an admittedly quite irritating 2-2 draw with Leicester.",
      "Absolutely do not rule this out if Sunday doesn’t go to plan.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim (Man United)\nWe had two fairly strong convictions heading into the Europa League final: that Ruben Amorim was safe either way, and that Ange Postecoglou was doomed either way.",
      "We might have been wrong about both of those. Because it’s not just that Spurs won the final, it’s that Postecoglou so thoroughly won the battle of the managers as well, sitting Amorim down emphatically.",
      "The damning thing for Amorim is that when United are bad – and that is alarmingly often, including in the game they had decided many months ago was the one that would define their season – he is guilty of everything Ange stands accused of: stubborn, rigid adherence to a set way of doing things even when it’s demonstrably not working and the players aren’t buying into it.",
      "And while United played all their hits in Bilbao, never remotely looking like a team, defending incompetently, disappearing when the pressure was on, it was Ange and Spurs who showed the willingness to adapt and take the pragmatic approach to the reality in front of them.",
      "Shorn of their own main creative outlets, Spurs adopted a low-block-and-counter approach against United that they had deployed equally effectively to varying degrees when also keeping clean sheets in key knockout games at Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt.",
      "Amorim’s one concession to any deviation from his set plan appears to be ‘Chuck Harry Maguire up front and lump it in the mixer’. Look, we don’t hate it as, say, a Plan J or K and it is undeniably on occasion effective.",
      "But as a sole Plan B it’s, frankly, pish.",
      "Whoever lost the final was going to be in a bleak place after what was one of the highest-stakes games it’s possible to imagine given the extent to which both sides had sacked off everything else for this one night.",
      "There are different ways to lose, though. And United picked the worst possible one: an almost total failure to turn up at all against opposition with obvious, punishable frailties both deep-rooted and superficial, both physical and mental.",
      "Amorim got his selection wrong. Then he got his subs – or rather lack of subs – wrong. Bruno Fernandes had a horrible game and that’s a thing that can happen to any player at any time, fair enough, but did Amorim’s deployment of him in such a deep-lying position against such a deep-set opponent really give his best player his best chance to exert the influence and control of which he is capable?",
      "The indications are that United will continue with Amorim, and that’s to be expected for Sunk Cost FC. There is still a very fair argument that he deserves a summer to at least try and instil his ideas – and as importantly his players – in the squad.",
      "But the fact he so obviously needs a full summer only highlights what a complete pig’s anus United made of the whole thing in failing to act decisively last summer and then bringing in that kind of manager mid-season.",
      "And Amorim’s own decision to ignore his gut and make a mid-season move already looks like one of the worst judgement calls in recent times. Because there are no guarantees this yet represents rock-bottom for a broken football club.",
      "",
      "Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham)\nHas pulled off one of the great season-long pranks by doing what he said he would from the start and winning Tottenham a trophy in his second season.",
      "But the absolute and total sacrifice of Tottenham’s league form to facilitate that potentially transformative banter-ending win means that doubts about his long-term viability and suitability remain.",
      "We’ve changed our tune and declared that he deserves the chance to prove he’s learned the lessons of this season, that adaptability and pragmatism need not always be dirty words, and see if he can apply those knockout learnings to the more humdrum workaday business of the league.",
      "David Ornstein, though, is a man who knows his onions regarding these matters and he remains of the view that the Spurs board remain of a mind to follow through on their planned change of course this summer.",
      "That’s going to be a harder sell for Daniel Levy to a newly enchanted fanbase than it might have been.",
      "Whatever direction it takes, a genuinely fascinating summer awaits now at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium given the unexpected and vast opportunities that have just presented themselves.",
      "",
      "Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nFeels like more rests on Sunday’s final Premier League day than next Wednesday’s Europa Conference final, at least with regard to Maresca’s own future.",
      "Winning the Conference has long felt close to an inevitability for a Chelsea side absurdly overpowered compared to its opposition. In a year when the 16th and 17th best teams in England have been able to dominate the Europa League, Chelsea had absolutely no wriggle room in the third-tier competition.",
      "What matters surely for Maresca now is returning Chelsea to the Champions League. However slapdash and unfocused their spending may be, it is spending at a level that demands that platform. Really, it demands a title challenge of some kind.",
      "Even when Chelsea appeared capable of delivering such a challenge, Maresca insisted they couldn’t. It always felt vaguely self-interested and also perhaps slightly self-fulfilling. For a manager who came into the job to a chorus of doubts surrounding his total lack of top-flight managerial experience it didn’t exactly inspire confidence that he understood the assignment.",
      "A late pick-up in league form has slightly quietened the noise around Maresca’s future, but the fact remains that he is yet to ensure he even matches Mauricio Pochettino’s sixth-place effort from last season, and a stunning run of form to end the season couldn’t save the Argentinean 12 months ago.",
      "",
      "Scott Parker (Burnley)\nMuch of the arguments here apply equally as clearly if slightly more harshly to Daniel Farke who has delivered the Championship title for Leeds.",
      "The concern with both promoted managers is that we already knew they were very good Championship managers, but equally all the evidence we have points to them being rotten top-flight ones.",
      "Farke, though, having delivered better results in more striking fashion, dodges the final spot on this list in favour of Parker, whose often grim sufferball tactics to steer Burnley to promotion don’t suggest a thrilling bid for Premier League survival is in store.",
      "Just as teams who get promoted playing great free-flowing attacking football – like Burnley’s last promoted team under Vincent Kompany – find the step up unmanageable, we fear that a team that has gone so far the other way will be equally exposed by the step up.",
      "There has to be a middle ground, and we have little confidence Parker can find it at a level that has already proved beyond him before."

      "He is under contract until 2028 and is valued at €50million (£41.9m) by Transfermarkt.",
      "It hasn’t been the most productive campaign for the 23-year-old, who has scored 10 goals and provided six assists in 27 Premier League appearances. Despite some promise, he has struggled to deliver consistent performances throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "There is strong interest in Pedro, and a Brighton exit looks increasingly likely – especially after he was reportedly involved in a training ground clash with Jan Paul van Hecke, which led to him being dropped from the squad for Monday’s win over Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "The Brazilian will also miss Sunday’s trip to Tottenham Hotspur, head coach Fabian Hurzeler has confirmed.",
      "“With Joao we had a small issue in training, the type which isn’t uncommon from time to time in all football clubs. We dealt with it internally and the matter is closed,” Hurzeler said.",
      "“Joao is an incredible football player, he’s a match-winner for us, he’s a great player and that’s why we invested in him.",
      "“But there are principles that are non-negotiable and count for everyone – that everyone has to stick to – where we don’t make any compromises.",
      "“Joao is still a young player. He will grow and I’m sure he will learn from this and come back stronger next season. I’m really looking forward to seeing him renewed and reinvigorated at his highest peak.”",
      "Now, a report from talkSPORT says Liverpool and Newcastle United are ‘showing interest’ in Pedro, who ‘would be keen to move to a bigger club this summer if Brighton agree to sell him’.",
      "It’s claimed the Seagulls want to ‘make a hefty profit’ on the £30m they spent and have ‘slapped £100m price tags’ on both Pedro and team-mate Carlos Baleba.",
      "Brighton are reportedly ‘under no financial pressure to sell’ and owner Tony Bloom ‘values Pedro and Baleba in the same bracket as Moises Caicedo’, who fetched a British record £115m fee.",
      "Dorsett adds that Pedro wants to discuss a move with Chelsea if the two clubs can agree a fee. No bids have been submitted yet, but the 23-year-old is expected to cost ‘£50m+’.",
      "Finally – and perhaps less reliably – Brazilian website Ge. Globo claims Chelsea have ‘started negotiations’ and ‘signalled an offer’ of €60m (£50.3m).",
      "The report suggests the Blues want to ‘speed up negotiations to get ahead of the competition’ and register Pedro for next month’s Club World Cup.",
      "Talks are reportedly expected to intensify next week, with Enzo Maresca’s side currently focusing on Sunday’s Champions League decider at Nottingham Forest on the Premier League’s final day.",
      "The Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea target ‘can leave Brighton’ this summer for £59m after an ‘altercation’ with a teammate in training.",

      "Aston Villa lost 2-0 to Man United and missed out on Champions League football on goal difference; Morgan Rogers' goal in the 73rd minute was controversially disallowed but VAR could not intervene due to the whistle being blown; Villa's John McGinn called the decision \"incredible\"",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 06:25, UK",
      "Aston Villa have made an official complaint to the PGMOL over the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their Premier League final-day match against Man Utd, which Champions League-chasing Villa lost after having a goal controversially ruled out.",
      "The defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the league, meaning they missed out on Champions League football next season when just a point would have seen them secure the top-five finish necessary to qualify.",
      "After the first-half sending-off of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, Villa's 10 players thought they had taken the lead in the second half when Morgan Rogers poked the ball free from Altay Bayindir and curled the ball into an open net, only for Bramall to disallow the goal for an alleged foul on the United goalkeeper.",
      "The referee awarded a free kick to United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession, only for replays to show he did not have both hands on the ball when Rogers poked it away. Because Bramall blew his whistle before Rodgers' shot crossed the goalline, VAR was unable to intervene.",
      "Villa were down to 10 after Emi Martinez's red card late in the first half, but thought they went ahead midway through the second with the game still at 0-0.",
      "Under little pressure, Man Utd keeper Altay Bayindir made a mess of sliding onto the ball in his box. Villa's Morgan Rogers dislodged the ball before swivelling and firing into the empty net, seemingly giving the visitors the lead. At the time, the goal would have seen Villa climb into the Champions League places with less than 20 minutes left on the final day of the season.",
      "The goal was disallowed by referee Thomas Bramall, who adjudged Rogers to have kicked the ball out of Bayindir's grasp. However, replays show the United 'keeper had lost possession before Rogers' intervention.",
      "Because Bramall blew the whistle before the goal was scored, VAR could not intervene and the goal did not stand.",
      "Amad Diallo scored for Man Utd three minutes later before Christian Eriksen's penalty doubled United's advantage in the 87th minute. The 2-0 loss at Old Trafford meant Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference, while a point would have been enough to lift them into fifth following Newcastle's 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "On Sunday evening Villa confirmed a complaint had been made, saying: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today's game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today's fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.",
      "\"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "Bramall has officiated 11 games in the top-flight of English football this season and 17 other match officials have taken charge of more fixtures than him throughout the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said post-match. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession,\" read a Premier League match centre statement on X.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "\"The goal (being) disallowed was the key moment but overall they deserve it more. We were resilient with one player less and we could score one goal. It was a good opportunity to continue being resilient and keep the result.",
      "\"I speak to the referee and he knows it (was a mistake). But I don't want to speak about VAR.",
      "\"We go to Europa League but we were close to Champions League. Our objective (at the start of the season) was to be in Europe, and we have to be happy and proud with what we did.\"",
      "Villa captain John McGinn has slammed the \"incredible\" decision to rule out Rogers' goal at Old Trafford during the 2-0 defeat which cost the visitors a spot in the Champions League.",
      "\"No one in the dressing room or watching felt like we deserved to win. Man Utd were the better team but the decision is incredible.",
      "\"Everyone, when VAR was implemented, wanted correct decisions. I know it is the rule but it is so hard to take, especially with the impact it has on us.",
      "\"To whistle at that point, it is hard to take. All you need is a point to get into the Champions League.\""

      "Goals from Amad Diallo and Christian Eriksen decided the game in United's favour but only after Emiliano Martinez had been sent off and the decision to call a foul against Morgan Rogers before he had put the ball into Altay Bayindir's net - much to Villa's fury.",
      "The United goalkeeper, in for Andre Onana, did not appear to have both hands on the ball when Rogers dispossessed him but referee Thomas Bramall had already blown the whistle for a foul before the ball hit the net so VAR was unable to allow the goal to stand.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (5), Lindelof (6), Maguire (6), Heaven (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (6), Amad (8), Mount (7), Hojlund (5).\n\n\nSubs used: Dalot (n/a), Mainoo (7), Eriksen (7), Evans (6), Obi (n/a).\n\n\nAston Villa: Martinez (5), Cash (4), Konsa (6), Pau (5), Maatsen (5), Kamara (6), Onana (7), McGinn (6), Asensio (6), Rogers (6), Watkins (6).\n\n\nSubs used: Olsen (6), Tielemans (6), Ramsey (6), Malen (n/a), Barkley (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Amad Diallo.",
      "Unai Emery's side came into the final day knowing that even a win might not be good enough, but with Newcastle losing to Everton, a draw would have been enough in the end. But Amad's header and Eriksen's 87th-minute penalty ended their hopes.",
      "For United, it was a welcome fillip after the disappointment of their Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao on Wednesday. This was their first victory over a team that will still be in the Premier League next season since they won at Fulham in January.",
      "But the focus will be on Villa, denied Champions League football next season as a result of this defeat - and a call which left them fuming.",
      "Aston Villa intend to make an official complaint to the Premier League that a more experienced referee was not selected to officiate a game of such magnitude.",
      "Speaking alongside Unai Emery in the post-match press conference, Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany confirmed that the complaint would focus on the selection of Bramall to officiate the match, with Champions League football on the line.",

      "\"The key moment was of course the goal of Morgan Rogers and how the referee decided the action. He whistled and of course he needed to have it under his control. I spoke with the referee and he knows his mistake.",
      "We make mistakes every day, I do as well. I believe in VAR and I think we have very good referees in the Premier League but sometimes they make a mistake.",

      "\"It was really hard in many games but now we have to make a choice. Stay stuck in the past, because this season is in the past, it is over. We fight each other, or we stick together and move forward.",
      "\"Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you, the storm is coming. Today, after this disastrous season, I want to tell you, the good days are coming.",
      "\"If there is one club in the world that can overcome any situation, any disaster, it's our club. It's Manchester United.",

      "\"Luke, it's not your job to determine that. A player at Manchester United should have no control as to whether they're there or not. The manager of the football club decides whether you're good enough to play in that football team.",
      "\"When the players are starting to come out and question publicly whether they're good enough to play for the club, you know how bad it is internally there. You imagine what they're saying to each other inside.",
      "\"I have this thing about negativity spiral in my businesses, in my life. If I hear the energy-sapping negativity spiral starting to move, whereby you can feel people starting to have an influence over the others, and Luke's an experienced player now, honestly, I think you've got to wipe it out. You've got to wipe out every single player in that dressing room who doesn't believe that they've got total and utter confidence to play for that football club.",
      "\"There were some players on that pitch and some players on the bench who I think can still do a good job for Manchester United. I don't believe it's a case of get rid of them all. I think there's some talent in there. I believe that. And this idea that they don't care, I'll repeat what I've said many, many times again, never, ever think that of football players.",
      "\"Do they want to lose football matches? Do they want to be criticised on social media? The answer is no. They do care. They've worked thousands of hours to get to this position of playing for the club, but the club is eating them alive. The club is eating them alive, it's too big for them.\"",
      "Neville called on Amorim to take swift action this summer, comparing the situation to how Mikel Arteta has played a big role in the overhaul at Arsenal in recent years.",

      "\"Ruben Amorim needs to look at next season, how he gets into the top six, how he basically wipes half that squad out, how he transforms it into a dynamic team that plays exciting football from the rigid stuff that we're currently watching, and he needs to think about which players in that dressing room can do a job for him.",
