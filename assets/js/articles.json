      "Chelsea's preparations for their Premier League match against Manchester United have been dealt a blow with the news that Christopher Nkunku won't be fit to return. The Blues were already without the suspended Nicolas Jackson, and both they and their opponents are well below full-strength for Friday's game.",
      "Jackson was sent off last weekend as Chelsea lost to Newcastle to leave their Champions League qualification hopes in jeopardy. Anything less than two wins from the final two games will leave the door open for Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest, with the latter hosting Enzo Maresca's team on the final day.",
      "Jackson and Nkunku are two of 16 players missing from across the two squads. The latter was already expected to sit the game out, having also missed the victory over Liverpool, but Maresca confirmed as much in his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"Christo is close to coming back and training with us,\" Maresca told reporters. \"I said two weeks ago it was a very small problem, ten days, two weeks. Probably next week he can start already with us.\"",
      "Nkunku and Jackson are among several Chelsea players missing for the game, but Reece James is available to play a part. Maresca confirmed the club captain has recovered from illness, but others will have to wait to make their returns.",
      "Chelsea striker Marc Guiu has been out injured since February. He's now back in training but Maresca confirmed he isn't fit to start on Friday - and he might not be ready to feature at all.",
      "Wesley Fofana and Omari Kellyman are out for the season through injury, while Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended and Jadon Sancho is unable to face his parent club. Young defender Aaron Anselmino is another injury doubt while James' recent illness means that - while he could feature - Chelsea may decide not to risk him.",
      "As for Manchester United, Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are unavailable due to season-ending injuries. Leny Yoro is also unlikely to be back in time after being forced off in last week's defeat to West Ham, while there are question marks over Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "With a Europa League final coming up against Tottenham on Wednesday, United boss Ruben Amorim may opt against risking others who have only recently returned to training. That means Toby Collyer and Jonny Evans could get another game to recover if not required at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Amorim was also asked about Luke Shaw, having withdrawn the defender at the same time as Yoro last weekend, but indicated he was keen to protect the defender amid a tough time for injuries around the club this term. \"It’s not what it’s going to be, it’s the history,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We have to manage the minutes, like Mason Mount. Mason Mount is ready, but we are trying to build these guys a little bit longer for them to cope. Then, in the future, they will be okay.”"

      "Manchester United could take a £60million loss on Marcus Rashford in the space of a year with the forward believing they may let him leave for £40m. The academy graduate is on loan at Aston Villa, but faces an uncertain future once the season ends.",
      "The 27-year-old moved to Villa Park in February in a loan deal that included a £40m option-to-buy clause. That however does not prevent any other club signing the forward, whose time in the Midlands will come to an end on 30 June.",
      "Rashford has rediscovered his form whilst playing under Unai Emery and that may have put him back in the shop window. He struggled to strike up a relationship with Ruben Amorim and the Manchester outfit may decide to cut their losses.",
      "If they do their timing could cost them huge sums. Only last summer Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co slapped a £100m price tag on the forward. That figure was enough to see PSG back out of potentially signing the player, who could now leave for well below his previous market value.",
      "United have struggled over the years to time their business right with a number of players leaving once their values had plummeted - some of them recouping no fee whatsoever.",
      "Paul Pogba endured a mixed time at the club but interest in him often remained and he flirted with the exit door. The Red Devils often stuck to their stance that he wasn't for sale, but he later left in the summer of 2022 for nothing when his contract expired.",
      "Jesse Lingard was once linked with a £25m move to West Ham, but the Hammers chose not to pay the fee and the player later left for nothing. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson was once valued at £40m - as per the Daily Star - but later joined Crystal Palace for half of that.",
      "Rashford could be the latest star to leave and ultimately cost United big sums. He is unlikely to have much of a future at his boyhood club whilst Amorim is in charge with the Portuguese boss casting him out soon after arriving in Manchester.",
      "\"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it,\" said the United boss after his exit. \"Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different. I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\""

      "Manchester United have the chance to sign Jonathan David on a free transfer this summer after he confirmed that he's leaving Lille. David, 25, won't sign a new contract with the French club and move on to pastures new when his current deal expires on June 30.",
      "The Canadian striker has been linked with United alongside a host of European giants for many years, having impressed for Lille ever since his move from Gent in 2020. David lifted the Ligue 1 title in his first season and has scored 109 goals in 231 games for Les Dogues, putting him third in the club's all-time goalscorer charts.",
      "That kind of output would be ideal for United, who've prioritised signing a striker in the summer transfer window. The Red Devils want an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who've scored a combined 17 goals this season compared to David's 25.",
      "The 25-year-old has also chipped in with 12 assists, as Lille head into the final day on Saturday battling for fourth place which would earn them a spot in the Europa League. But if they qualify, David won't be a part of it.",
      "\"I wanted to tell you myself that after so many years at the club, it's time for me to say goodbye,\" he said in a video posted on Instagram. \"I've spent five wonderful seasons here, I know it hasn't always been easy, but I hope that with my goals and celebrations, I've managed to bring you some joy, especially with the French championship title and the Champions Trophy.\"",
      "Thanking his team-mates, David added: \"I know I didn't have the easiest start, but you've always been behind me, you've supported me through the tough times, and for that, I'll keep you in my heart.\"",
      "The Canada international has most recently been linked with Napoli as well as Barcelona and Newcastle. David isn't the only striker on United's radar either, with Liam Delap understood to be their No.1 target and available for £30million following Ipswich's relegation.",
      "But the fact that United wouldn't have to pay a fee for David could sway them. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made it clear the Red Devils are in a precarious financial position which makes winning the Europa League final against Tottenham next Wednesday even more important, as it'd guarantee them a place in next season's Champions League which is worth roughly £100m."

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has seen his wealth decrease by almost £6.5billion over the last 12 months. The British billionaire's staggering loss was the biggest among those included on The Sunday Times Rich List 2025.",
      "Ratcliffe was ranked fourth in the 2024 list and topped the standings in 2018. But he has now fallen to become the seventh-richest individual in Britain, behind the likes of Sir James Dyson and Gopi Hinduja and family, who sits atop the list.",
      "The INEOS chief, who competed a deal to buy into United last year, was worth £23.519billion in the 2024 Rich List. However, that has now decreased by £6.473bn to £17.046bn.",
      "Ratcliffe still maintains a very healthy net worth but, given the financial struggles the Red Devils have endured in recent years, it certainly doesn't bode well for fans hoping for an immediate return to success under the Failsworth-born businessman.",
      "Ratcliffe has been brutally honest about the dire financial situation he's walked into at Old Trafford since arriving at the club in February 2024.",
      "Despite the 13-time Premier League champions consistently ranking as one of the largest revenue-generating teams in world football, the 72-year-old stunned supporters in his wide-ranging interview with Gary Neville earlier this year.",
      "It was in March that he claimed the club were set to run out of money this year without his £232m ($300m) investment. \"Manchester United would have run out of money at the end of this year. November this year, the club runs out of cash,\" he told the United legend.",
      "Ratcliffe - who has led multiple redundancy rounds at the club since his arrival - explained just how serious the financial situation has evolved. \"If you think about Manchester United as a business, it’s gone off the rails. It’s gone off the rails a long way, really,\" he said.",
      "\"If you look at the numbers, the numbers were fairly scary, really. Because they’d sort of lost control, I think, of where the ship was headed. And the costs had got out of control.",
      "\"If you think of it in really simple terms, you’ve got the operating costs, which are all the staff and the fixed costs of running the business. And then you’ve got all the squad costs, player salaries and player purchases.",
      "\"In super-simple terms, the club has been spending more money than it’s been earning now for the last seven years, and it ends in a very difficult place.\"",
      "With United set to finish no higher than 13th in the league this season, their miserable campaign can be somewhat saved should they claim victory in the Europa League final on Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Not only would a win capture a piece of silverware for a third season straight, it would also be Ruben Amorim's first for the club and could see them bank £100m in revenue given they'll qualify for the Champions League."

      "Those making it onto this year list needed to scrape by on at least £350million. At the top is Indian-born British businessman Gopi Hinduja and his family, with a wealth put at £35.billion, though down from £37billion last year.",
      "The list took in both inherited wealth and self-made tycoons. The latter includes ex-market trader Tom Morris, who is behind booming discount chain Home Bargains, and is known as Liverpool’s richest man. The publicity-shy businessman is in 26th place on the list, with his fortune growing from £6.67billion to almost £7billion.",

They started the business from their parents’ Liverpool home, and have hit the big leagues at £350million, despite still being aged in their 30s.",

And after just celebrating his 50th birthday in lavish style, David Beckham - along with wife Victoria - are said to be worth half a billion, and up from £455million in 2024. That said, it comes amid reports of ongoing tensions within the Beckham family.",

The chemicals magnate, whose Ineos Group bought a near 28% stake in United in February 2024, was the biggest faller on this year’s The Sunday Times Rich List.",
      "The 72-year-old is still worth an eye-watering £17billion, but has slipped to seventh place - having led the rankings of Britain’s mega-wealthy in 2018. The slump was fuelled by losses at his Ineos empire, where debts have grown. The group has also been impacted by US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs.",

      "Luke Hildyard, executive director of think tank the High Pay Centre, said: “The Rich List is a useful annual reminder of the inefficiency of the UK economy. It shows a small fall in the value of oligarch assets this year, but over a longer period it illustrates how a tiny handful of very rich people have captured an increasing share of the country’s wealth.",
      "If the super-rich and the companies they own were taxed more effectively and paid the people that work for them a better wage, living standards in Britain would be much higher. Meanwhile the Rich List entrants would still be extremely rich by any reasonable person’s definition and well rewarded for whatever success they have achieved.”",
      "This year’s list of 350 individuals and families together hold combined wealth of £772.8billion - 3% down on last year.",
      "Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, said: “Our billionaire count is down and the combined wealth of those who feature in our research is falling. We are also finding fewer of the world’s super-rich are coming to live in the UK.”",
      "He warned there was growing anger among the mega-rich about the expected abolition of non-dom status and tax changes. That is despite millions of ordinary families struggling to make ends mean and Chancellor Rachel Reeves forced to slash spending, and unleash welfare cuts, to plug a blackhole in the government’s finances left by the Tories."

      "United are heavily linked with Matheus Cunha, who has thrived at Wolves. Liam Delap is also very much on their radar after an impressive season at Ipswich and scoring goals has been a major issue in Manchester - especially with their frontmen underdelivering.",
      "With that in mind attacking reinforcements are high up on the shortlist - as are wing-backs. The 3-4-3 system means that players with specific skillsets are needed and we take a look at who Amorim and co are eyeing up this summer.",

      "Lawrence's exit had been likely and he's looking to work in a first-team environment but is equally open to a fresh academy challenge. Wilcox and Nick Cox are now eyeing someone to replace the outgoing coach with talks already underway, reports the MEN.",
      "Wilcox is among those bought to Manchester under the Sir Jim Ratcliffe reign and serves as technical director, but did step in as sporting director. Earlier in his career Wilcox himself was the academy director at Manchester City and has proven himself in that capacity.",

The attacking midfielder has been offered to United and Liverpool ahead of the summer transfer window opening.",
      "United are thought to be keen on Cherki given that he has a low price tag of around £19m. His influence in the final third would be a huge plus for Amorim and the club are actively seeking to bolster their attacking resources."

      "It was reported at the turn of the year that Amorim wants to sign a new goalkeeper who can push Onana. With the Cameroonian continuing to make high-profile mistakes, an increasing number of fans want the club to go searching for a direct replacement.",
      "The former Inter Milan shot-stopper wants to stay, though, and his recent decision to change agencies wasn't made with a view to a transfer. Turkey international Bayindir, however, could be the one to leave Old Trafford in search of more regular starts, with the 2026 World Cup a year away.",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton is in the final few weeks of his current contract and turned 39 last week. Senior United figures hope that Onana can rediscover his best form which he's rarely showcased since his £47million transfer from Inter in 2023.",
      "Those same figures and Amorim have prioritised bringing in a playmaker, a striker and a midfielder. United hope to make three or four key signings and Champions League revenue would help them secure their top targets.",
      "In order to bank that, the Red Devils need to win the Europa League final next Wednesday. Amorim's side face Tottenham, with Onana expected to start.",
      "Amorim was recently asked whether he'd consider signing a new goalkeeper in the summer transfer window. \"We are going to make that evaluation for any position in the squad,\" the United manager replied. \"You can see my record [too] - my record is the worst in the team.",
      "\"I am also underperforming. We need to improve. We cannot change all the players. We need to improve every position on the field. Goalkeeper is the same; we can work with Andre. Andre Onana already proved he is a top player with Inter. Altay the same with Fenerbahce. We have some seasons where we are underperforming.\""

      "Ruben Amorim has told his Manchester United stars Friday night's clash at Chelsea is their audition for next week's Europa League final. Amorim's side go to Stamford Bridge in 16th place in the table, after United's worst season of the Premier League era, one which has seen them suffer 17 defeats.",
      "United's entire season hinges on next Wednesday's Europa League final showdown with fellow Premier League strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao. As well as lifting the trophy, the winners will also go straight into next season's Champions League, which is worth up to £100million in revenue.",
      "With so much on the line next week, Amorim has told his squad there are still places up for grabs before he decides on his starting line-up for the final.",
      "Asked if some players still have a chance of forcing their way into his line-up for the showpiece game against Spurs, Amorim said: \"Yes, that is clear. We want to win at Chelsea and we want to perform. I know the starting eleven I am thinking of for Chelsea and then I will see.",
      "\"Even the way we play there against Chelsea, I will see it and it will be important for the next game. It's going to be a massive part of this game to go to the next one, so we need to perform and they need to perform - that's an important thing. We cannot spend eight or nine days without a game before the final. That is a bad thing for the final. So we will prepare for the game.\"",
      "Amorim is desperate to see United finish their miserable league campaign on a high and not write off the final two fixtures just because of the importance of the final. The United boss added: \"The best way is to face the game like we should face the game – that is to win the game.",
      "\"We need to perform, to win points in the Premier League. That's the feeling. We talked about this after the West Ham game. We need to improve in the way we face competitions and stay focused in every moment of the game. These details matter. The only way I know how to prepare for a final is that in the normal game for our league, we must play the same way as we would do in a final.",
      "\"The players have to understand that if you play or don't play against Chelsea, it means nothing in terms of the final. That's important. I'm just preparing for the game at Chelsea. That's my focus. We want to win and we want to perform.\"",
      "With doubts over the long-term fitness of Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt, Amorim has hinted he could sign a new centre-back this summer.",
      "Amorim said: \"I was thinking about next year and the squad, if we need another guy, if it's a long injury. That's my concern. It's not just about the final. Of course I want every player to be fit. But Leny Yoro had that problem with his foot. I was so concerned about the next season, the next squad, the way we build up the squad. That was my biggest concern.\""

      "Sean Dyche claims he would win more games than Ruben Amorim after admitting his Manchester United dream. The Red Devils have endured a rotten season in 2024/25, with the Portuguese boss failing to arrest the slide.",
      "They currently sit 16th in the table with just two games remaining and could even finish just one place above the relegation zone. Amorim has already claimed that his job should be under scrutiny should things not improve very quickly next season.",
      "Former Everton and Burnley boss Dyche has recently admitted that United are one club he would love to manage before the end of his career, while suggesting that time is running out for Amorim to turn the tide.",
      "Speaking to Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, he said: “It was always Manchester United because of the size of the club, not because it’s Man U – but due to the sheer grandeur, particularly back then. I know they are going through a tough run at the minute, but the whole worldwide feel of it. That’s a big superpowered club.”",
      "Dyche added: “He [Ruben Amorim] better win some games – pretty quick. I reckon if I went there and played my way, we’d win more games. Just 4-4-2 – give them basic rules of principles. They have some good players. You don’t have to over teach everyone.",
      "“I’d be interested more in the longer run, if he can stick to his principles and then next season, we’re all going, ‘Fair play’ – but, he’s been there a while now so you better start bringing some wins soon.",
      "“I’d be surprised if Ruben Amorim is not under pressure [early next season]. Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt this season – he’s laying down his platform for success, the future, and educating, let’s say.",
      "\"Then you get your pre-season, because now you’ve got that window to actually work on it, day in, day out. Shift a few players out who maybe don’t buy in, shift the players in who do buy in. Then, if it’s not early next season, how long do you go?",
      "“The perfect scenario is at least if you get a pre-season and juggle the transfers, then by Christmas, if you’re not having some form of success – most people go, ‘Things need to start working pretty quickly’. You probably get the next window, and then by January/February, they are going, ‘It’s not working’.”",
      "Fortunately for Amorim, he has a way of rescuing United’s season and ensure Dyche stays away from Old Trafford. United take on Tottenham in the Europa League final later this month and will secure a spot in the Champions League should they secure victory."

      "This is United's antepenultimate fixture in what has hitherto been their worst season in 51 years. Here are five things to look out for at Chelsea tonight:",
      "Hints at final XI?",
      "The five-day gap United have between Chelsea and the Europa League final should ensure Amorim picks a reasonably strong side. Andre Onana, Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu, Casemiro and Alejandro Garnacho, all benched against West Ham United, could return.",
      "The majority who do not play tonight can effectively be discounted as a starter against Spurs. The only allowance Amorim could make is for Leny Yoro, given how recent his foot injury was.",
      "Another unwanted stat?",
      "Last week marked the first time United have gone seven league games without a win since November 1992. Weeks after that winless run, Eric Cantona was paraded at Old Trafford.",
      "It is too late for a signing to save this league season for United and more records could still tumble before next week's finale against Aston Villa. Fail to beat Chelsea tonight and it is the first eight-game winless streak in the league since January 1990, the last season that United finished in the bottom half. The season ended with Alex Ferguson's first trophy in the FA Cup.",
      "Centre back trial and error?",
      "Noussair Mazraoui was one of the players to speak at United's Uefa media day on Wednesday, a signal he will start in Bilbao. Mazraoui has started in all but eight of United's 57 matches this season and merits inclusion in Amorim's XI next week.",
      "The Moroccan played in a back three against West Ham, with Amad on the right. That seemed to be a dress rehearsal for their possible roles against Spurs and the injury to Yoro should not necessarily have a bearing on that.",
      "Yet if Yoro is out, Amorim will have to consider Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof. Shaw was taken off at the same time as Yoro against West Ham to protect him amid the spate of injuries at centre back. Lindelof lined up in both semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Ayden Heaven has travelled with the squad for tonight's game but he hasn't played since the 3-0 win over Leicester two months ago.",
      "Where does Amad start?",
      "Whatever United's best team is, Amad has to be in it. Amorim has played Amad on the wing and as one of the two No.10s since his return from an ankle injury two weeks ago.",
      "Amad has scored one goal, assisted another, helped change the game against Athletic in the second leg and was United's sole positive against West Ham.",
      "A rousing send-off",
      "The switch of the away end at Stamford Bridge from the east stand to the Shed End in 2005 has seen the ground host some raucous United atmospheres over the past 20 years. The ridiculous 7pm Sunday night kick-off United had at Leicester in March made no difference to United's supporters, who were in their finest voice all season.",
      "A similar atmosphere is probable this evening. United are five days out from a European final and their matchgoers will sing about it incessantly. Some will doubtless remain in London and fly to Bilbao from Heathrow or Gatwick."

      "The squad has been found wanting time and again this term and Amorim will be keen to stamp his mark on the side in his first summer transfer window in charge. The Portuguese has jettisoned the likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony and several other players will be released or sold at the end of the campaign.",

      "Yet striking such a deal will not be straightforward. United are sailing close to the wind on Profit and Sustainability rules and have several areas of the squad in need of surgery.",
      "Centre back isn't really one. Amorim has Lisandro Martinez, Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as senior options in a back three, while young prospect Ayden Heaven has shown his potential this season and Noussair Mazrouri has slotted in.",
      "Even with Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans set to depart this summer and the injury record of some of those defensive options, moving for another central back feels a risk when United will have to box clever with their signings.",
      "The priority is in attack given United's struggles in front of goal. The Reds have failed to score in 14 games this season. Striker Rasmus Hojlund has struggled to find the net with any regularity while Joshua Zirkee looks more at home in one of the number 10 roles.",
      "Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap are leading targets and both players have release clauses. The latter will be available for £30million while Cunha could move to Old Trafford for £62.5million with the player keen on a deal.",

      "Manchester United have endured an abysmal Premier League season, but someone will be named POTY and Bruno Fernandes is the hot favourite to claim the prize for a second successive year.",
      "Fernandes won the award for a third time last season and is looking to emulate David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo, who are the only players to have won the prize on four occasions.",
      "Most believe Fernandes is a shoo-in for the award and you certainly wouldn't bet against him winning it again. Fernandes has continued to be a driving force in a struggling team this season and United might have been dragged into a relegation scrap without him.",
      "And would United be in the Europa League final without Fernandes? He has contributed seven goals and five assists in the competition, including a brace against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Fernandes will be remembered among the greatest United captains when he eventually leaves the club. He is a Bryan Robson-esque figure and would be a worthy winner of POTY again.",
      "Yet there could be a cat put among the pigeons if Amad can sprinkle some magic in next week's Europa League final. Amad was a leading contender for the POTY award until he sustained an ankle injury during training in February.",
      "It's easy to forget that Amad had arguably become United's most important player in the winter. He scored the matchwinner against Manchester City in December, the equaliser against Liverpool at Anfield and netted a sensational 10 minute hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "Amad's momentum was disrupted by injury, but any concerns that he'd take a while to get up to speed after his return have been made to look pretty daft over the last three weeks.",
      "He scored off the bench against Brentford at the Gtech Stadium, doing brilliantly to create an opening, and he was the gamechanger when he came on against Bilbao at Old Trafford.",
      "His performance in the second leg helped United kill the tie at a time in the game when Bilbao were pushing to extend their 1-0 advantage. It was also the type of display that will make it impossible for Ruben Amorim not to start Amad against Tottenham in the final.",
      "Amad is far too influential to be named on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames and, if he delivers in the final, he could win the POTY award from Fernandes.",
      "The POTY award will not be on Fernandes' or Amad's mind. They will be focused on winning the Europa League, but it might not be the one-horse race that most believe.",
      "Amad has consolidated himself as a star this season after being in and out Erik Ten Hag's starting team. It would be fascinating to hear why Ten Hag overlooked him so often, as that decision has become even more confusing.",
      "Sources have always maintained that Amad is an elite trainer during sessions at Carrington, so the Dutchman's decision to overlook him must have simply been due to his perceived level.",
      "Ten Hag's assessment of Amad was wrong and the youngster will be ready for the Europa League final. He seems to embrace the biggest stage and could end the season on a huge high."

      "United were already without Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez. Yoro was forced off less than ten minutes into the second half after going down clutching his left foot. His absence, along with De Ligt's, from Wednesday morning's open training session at Carrington sparked fears he could be in danger of missing next week's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "Those fears were confirmed later in the day when Amorim said: \"I don't know if they're going to be available, we'll try to push, it's a final, all the players want to play really bad. I don't think they will not go to Chelsea but we'll have some of them for the final.\"",
      "The prospect of De Ligt and Yoro both missing the final will leave United light on options at centre-back. Martinez will not play again this season and Heaven, despite being back in the squad for the trip to Chelsea, will need time to build up his sharpness after two months without playing.",
      "It means Amorim could find himself boarding the plane to Bilbao next week with a senior centre-back pool of Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Heaven.",
      "Maguire, regardless of what happens with De Ligt and Yoro between now and the middle of next week, should start against Spurs. He has continued his renaissance this season and has played a starring role in United's Europa League campaign.",
      "However, Lindelof, despite starting both legs of the semi-final triumph against Athletic Bilbao, and Evans, have not been front and centre of United's defence this season. The pair of them are also highly likely to be released this summer.",
      "Amorim may find himself having to ask Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw to tuck into the back-three and operate as the wide centre-backs either side of Maguire.",
      "Mazraoui, who was originally signed last summer to challenge Diogo Dalot at right-back in a back-four, has often played at centre-back under Amorim. The prospect of him starting at right-sided centre-back would open the door for Amad to start at right wing-back, or possibly Dalot, who is also fighting to be fit in time for the final.",
      "On the other side of Maguire, Shaw is realistic option to start. Since making his long-awaited return from injury in April, the former Southampton man has made seven appearances, with practically all of his game time coming as a left-sided centre-back.",
      "His left-footed profile offers United balance and he lacks the athleticism to operate as a wing-back in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Heaven, too, is left-footed and is in contention to feature in the capital, but it feels unlikely that he will be thrown straight in after a spell on the sidelines.",
      "It means Amorim could set out his blueprint for the Europa League final by selecting a back-three of Mazraoui, Maguire and Shaw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge this evening, which would mark the first time they have started alongside each other as the three centre-backs..",
      "Amorim has hinted that he plans to name a strong XI for the trip to the capital, meaning he must strike the right balance between ensuring his players maintain their match sharpness and not taking any unnecessary risks on key players ahead of the tussle with Spurs.",
      "Tyler Fredricson has had a few opportunities in the Premier League of late, but he is very unlikely to start against Spurs, meaning Amorim may overlook him against Chelsea and instead experiment with a back-three that could easily end up starting in Spain."

      "Now, those who disregard this new rule will be given yellow cards. Chelsea have accumulated the highest number of yellow cards in the Premier League this season (96) with Manchester United in eighth with 76.",
      "Manchester City have received the lowest number of yellow cards with 56 throughout the league. Pep Guardiola's men have also picked up the joint-lowest red cards with just one."

      "United were sentenced to their 17th league defeat of the season last time out, losing 2-0 to West Ham United at Old Trafford last Sunday afternoon, leaving them 16th in the table with just two games left to play.",
      "The defeat to the Hammers extended United's winless run in the league to seven matches, which equalled their longest run without a victory in the Premier League era. Their last victory was against Leicester City on March 16.",
      "Of course, almost all of the focus for United is on next Wednesday night's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, meaning head coach Ruben Amorim could be forgiven for shuffling his pack at Stamford Bridge. However, he has hinted that he will be naming a strong XI.",
      "After being rested against West Ham last weekend, Andre Onana is primed to return in goal. He was replaced in goal by Altay Bayindir, who has started the last two league games, but the Cameroonian is expected to be recalled and feature in the league for the first time since the end of April.",
      "United will be without both Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt for the clash in the capital, with the duo facing a race against time to be fit for next week's clash with Spurs.",
      "With the pair absent for this one, Amorim could showcase his blueprint for the Europa League final and name a back-three of Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw. Maguire started the defeat to West Ham on the bench and could be recalled to the starting XI to ensure he maintains his match sharpness ahead of the clash with Spurs.",
      "If Mazraoui starts as the right-sided centre-back, Amad is the leading contender to start at right wing-back. He started for the first time since returning from injury against West Ham and was the only bright spark.",
      "He is likely to be a shoo-in to start against Spurs, meaning he could start against Chelsea to increase his match sharpness. Patrick Dorgu is a likely starter at left wing-back after starting on the bench last weekend.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, who had a testing afternoon against West Ham, is likely to start alongside Casemiro against Spurs, meaning all eyes will be on what midfield partnership Amorim deploys on Friday night. Casemiro is likely to start given he didn't feature against West Ham and he could join forces with Kobbie Mainoo in the engine room.",
      "In attack, Alejandro Garnacho will be eyeing a recall after being left out of the starting line-up last time out. Bruno Fernandes is likely to retain his place in the other No.10 berth, despite some calls for him to be wrapped in cotton wool ahead of the clash with Spurs.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is a guaranteed starter against Spurs amid a lack of alternative options up front, meaning Chido Obi may get the nod to start for the second away league game running.",

      "Paul Scholes believes Manchester United's history of winning trophies could be enough to win the Europa League final.",
      "United were awful and finished eighth in the Premier League last season, but they still finished the campaign with a stunning victory against Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "Making the Europa League final this season has also been a remarkable achievement given the team's contrasting form in the Premier League. Ruben Amorim's side are the only undefeated team in Europe and Tottenham Hotspur stand in their way of glory at the Estadio de San Mames.",
      "United and Tottenham are 16th and 17th respectively in the Premier League. They have both endured abysmal league campaigns, but one will lift the Europa League trophy.",
      "Spurs have not lifted a trophy since winning the Carabao Cup in 2008, while their last European success came through the UEFA Cup in 1984, which means they will be under huge pressure.",
      "Scholes believes United's trophy record will give them an advantage, and he made a comparison with Real Madrid. \"I have no logical reason why United should win it, other than recent experience and history,\" Scholes said.",
      "\"Look at Real Madrid in the last five years. They’ve not been a great team at times but that history just takes them to it. Realistically, they (Spurs) should win it, they’ve beaten us in the last three games.",
      "\"I think you’ll (Spurs) probably be the best team on the night, play really well, but we’ll win the game. We seem to find 10 or 15 minute spells where we win games. I think that’s what’ll happen.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Tottenham are the better team and added: \"It’s not about history really, it’s about a club mentality because history sounds like it’s sort of nostalgic, it’s not.",
      "\"It’s a mentality of a fanbase and club that think we’re going there and not coming out of this city until we’ve won. We know that can change, that could look stupid next Wednesday.",
      "\"You (Spurs) should with talent on the pitch, you’ve got better forwards, better centre halves, you’ve got better midfield players, other than Bruno, you should win that game.",
      "\"You’ve beaten us the last three times because you’re a better team than us. The big surprise you should look at most is what Newcastle did against Liverpool because that was a big shock. I was amazed about how Newcastle did they beat Liverpool really well on the day.\"",

      "After securing Champions League qualification in the penultimate game of the season against Manchester City, this Sunday will be a chance for United to keep building momentum.",
      "However, they will be without one of their key playmakers as Skinner ruled out full-back Jayde Riviere after experiencing “irritation in her ankle” since suffering a knock in the first half of the Old Trafford derby earlier this month.",
      "Previewing the game, Marc Skinner admitted this weekend’s huge occasion is more of an event than a game, but at the same time, it’s ‘just a game’.",
      "He said: “It’s a one-off event, I don’t even call them games, this is an event. You go in there, and you have to put your best performance on the line and you know the opponent will try and do the same. It’s one of the toughest tasks in football but we’re Man United.",
      "“What we do as a team and what our players do, we can create history and so that’s what we’re going to aim to do again but the reality for us it’s a normal game, i’ll treat it the exact same as any other game and we’ll be ready to go into Chelsea this weekend.”",
      "Despite not being in action since United’s away draw with West Ham on 19 April, Skinner confirmed stalwart Rachel Williams will be back for weekend, while Aoife Mannion, who was suspended for the last game at Arsenal, is available again.",
      "Chelsea will be without long-term absentees Brooke Aspin, Sophie Ingle, Jorja Fox and Lauren James.",
      "Mayra Ramirez has been recovering from a knee injury and could return, and the same is true for Sam Kerr, with boss Bompastor fielding questions about her return for some weeks.",
      "On the ‘magic’ of the possibility of lifting the FA Cup for the second year in a row, Skinner admits it comes after an incredible amount of hard work.",
      "He added: “Yeah it will be [magical], and it’s going to come after a hell of a lot of work. I’m a realist so when we go into this game you have to take every detail as it comes, and live with no regrets and if we do that, we know we can beat any team.",
      "“We’re playing against the hardest team in the country, because they’re unbeaten in the WSL season but this isn’t the WSL and this is the FA Cup. It’s our cup. And we have to go into this game with full motivation and full focus and try and do what somebody hasn’t been able to achieve domestically this year, and that’s a great challenge for us. Something we’re looking forward to.”"

      "Only including available players and those with meaningful minutes this season, here is a Chelsea and Manchester United combined XI based on WhoScored match ratings in the 2024/25 Premier League.",
      "",
      "GK: Robert Sanchez (Chelsea) – 6.58\nDebates like Sanchez vs Andre Onana are exactly why we copped out with the WhoScored rating process. Both are error-prone but capable of world-class acrobatics. Unfortunately, the errors feel more frequent these days.",
      "What Onana does have over Sanchez is continuity: he’s United’s undisputed No.1, thanks in no small part to Altay Bayindir being extremely dodgy. Sanchez has rotated with Filip Jorgensen but has been Chelsea’s first choice for most of the league season. He should start on Friday, but a Europa Conference League final starting berth is up for grabs.",
      "",
      "RB: Noussair Mazraoui (Manchester United) – 6.79\nA rare bit of solid recruitment from United, Mazraoui has been quietly reliable since arriving from Bayern Munich for a measly £15m. He’s featured at right-back, left-back and as a wide centre-back in Ruben Amorim’s three-man defence, as well as in attacking midfielder under Erik ten Hag.",
      "He looked more comfortable in a back four for Ten Hag but has still been one of Amorim’s most consistent players. He gets in ahead of Reece James, who’s mostly been used off the bench as Enzo Maresca carefully manages his fitness.",
      "",
      "CB: Tosin Adarabioyo (Chelsea) – 6.67\nAnnoyingly, Tosin’s rating is 0.02 better than Trevoh Chalobah’s, who has formed a solid and settled partnership with Levi Colwill in the latter half of the season. If this was opinion-based, Chalobah would be in.",
      "Still, Tosin – signed on a free from Fulham – has started 13 league games and been a regular in the cups, including 10 of Chelsea’s 12 Conference League fixtures. A shrewd bit of business.",
      "",
      "CB: Levi Colwill (Chelsea) – 6.70\nThe highest-rated options were actually Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez, but the former has only played two league games and the latter’s been out since February with an ACL injury.",
      "Colwill, meanwhile, has been a mainstay for Chelsea, starting 33 of their 36 league matches.",
      "",
      "LB: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United) – 6.84\nDalot has been hit-and-miss under Amorim but the algorithm hasn’t minded too much. He just edges out Marc Cucurella (6.63). Often shuffled around, he’s spent some time at left-back and just about gets the nod here.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Chelsea) – 7.02\nCaicedo has recently been filling in at right-back while Romeo Lavia partners Enzo Fernandez in midfield, but we’re picking players in their natural positions for this XI.",
      "The Ecuadorian has quietly been Chelsea’s most consistent performer this season, and the £105m price tag has stopped being a stick to beat him with — which is always a good sign. He also scored a belter at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture.",
      "",
      "CM: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – 7.20\nUnited’s best player by an absurd distance. Fernandes has been excellent despite the circus around him. Without him, United might have exited Europe months earlier and ended up scrapping with the bottom three.",
      "",
      "RW: Amad Diallo (Manchester United) – 7.17\nFully fit and finding form at the right time. A shame Ten Hag didn’t trust him — might still have a job if he had.",
      "Amorim has recognised Amad’s talent immediately, and the former Sunderland and Rangers loanee has flourished in the 3-4-3 as one of the two wide No.10s.",
      "",
      "AM: Cole Palmer (Chelsea) – 7.35\nThe chippy chips connoisseur ended a ludicrous 18-game goal drought recently, but still has 15 goals and eight assists in 35 league appearances, which tells you how ridiculous his first half of the season was.",
      "He bagged a hat-trick against United at Stamford Bridge last season and will hope to torment them again as Chelsea chase a top-five finish.",
      "",
      "LW: Pedro Neto (Chelsea) – 6.78\nPlenty of wide options, all underwhelming.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s ineligible and wouldn’t start anyway, Mykhaylo Mudryk is still suspended after that failed drugs test, and Alejandro Garnacho is wildly inconsistent. Neto might not be setting the world alight, but he’s probably the best of an unconvincing bunch.",
      "",
      "ST: Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) – 6.41\nNicolas Jackson would’ve made this XI, but he decided to smash Sven Botman’s jaw and is suspended. So it’s Nkunku by default.",
      "He only has three Premier League goals but remains Chelsea’s second-top scorer across all competitions with 14. A summer move is likely — Liverpool are reportedly sniffing.",

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "What’s the point?\nIn the mailbox, Moses mentioned United don’t have parades for anything but Premier league and Champions league triumphs. What is the point of this self-imposed misery? The europa league is hardly a minor achievement if they do win, why not have a parade? Because you’re above that?",
      "If you can’t enjoy the journey to the top of football there really is no point. If the prem/champions league is the minimum why even have parades then? You should be winning trebles etc.. Treating football like a business where you can only celebrate hitting these benchmarks is just sad. Supporting a football club is not something you must do, why volunteer yourself for this and then treat victories like they’re actually not a good thing.",
      "Maybe I’d understand if it’s below expectations, like if City won the europa league, but United have now been utterly wank (by their lofty standards) for half of the current millenium. I hate United but still think their fans should enjoy a win, also hate Leeds but the parade they had for promotion looked great. I recently was at a Panachaiki (Patras) game where they managed to secure survival in the Greek second tier, hardly the zenith of football but all the locals who’ve watched their team continuously worsen over the past 20 years were having a great time (They’ve since been relegated for financial reasons but oh well). I’ve seen others point out they would be mocked for having a parade, who cares? Maybe this has only really risen with social media, but I cannot think of anything more insecure than not celebrating in case Ty from AFTV calls you a loser.",
      "Also agree totally with Lee (LFC) about Ratcliffe’s self made nonsense and what he forgot to include is when these massive corporations buyout struggling companies, they typically take out big loans, the debt from which is then saddled onto the struggling company they now own so said struggling company also has to pay off the loan used to buy them, as well as a variety of fees from their new owners (Which they avoid tax on!).

The utter joy in Sunderland was a sight to behold. Of course for Coventry fans — or Stockport for that matter, it’s agony, but the point I wanna make is that the playoffs are pure sporting drama — agony and ecstasy.",
      "There’s a lot of talk about how boring the PL season has been — with some truth, to be fair – and it made me wonder whether they’ve considered a playoff for the final CL spot (s)? so Top 4 get into the CL and then 5-8 play off? It would certainly liven things up. One of the joys of the playoffs is that a team can be way off it and still nip in to the final place.Stockport were 10 points better off than us (and it showed, quite often) and yet we’re the ones going to wembley.

      "Who’s going to admit culpability when a player inevitably gets injured in a “phase of play” that should never have been allowed to continue because an offside wasn’t given in time?",
      "And now, here we are with Taiwo Awoniyi (who I wish a speedy recovery, and I’m sure everyone else does as well).  I sit by a fellow season ticket holder in the Holte End who loses his shit every match when the assistant referee puts the flag up for offside about 2 minutes too late and I remind him every time that “it’s not his/her fault, they’re just doing what they’ve been told to do”.",
      "No amount of evidence or argument will convince me that this rule is a good one – it’s absolutely pointless and basically says VAR has the final say.  If that’s the case, we might as well do away with assistant referees altogether because the only other thing they have to do is flag for fouls or direct which way a throw in is given, with most of those decisions resulting in said assistant referee either not giving it at all or looking blankly at the actual referee waiting for them to give it! (Obviously not a serious suggestion.)",
      "The fix for this is really very, very simple.  If the player is blatantly offside by a considerable visual distance then let the assistant referee put their flag up as they will 99.99% be correct (if they’re not, demote them).  If the player is “close” to being offside to the point where it’s not visually easy to spot, THEN delay the raising of the flag so that VAR can check and confirm afterwards.  Yes, players may still get injured this way but it will be a hell of a lot less than the decisions where they are miles ahead of the last defender.  This makes perfect sense to me and I’d be interested to hear what other readers/commenters think?\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (And whilst we’re at it, keep VAR checks to 30 seconds otherwise the ref’s original call stands as it’s not “clear and obvious”.  You could even pipe the Countdown music out in the stadiums whilst the check is taking place.)",

      "The 21-year-old already has the backing of Liverpool‘s boo boys and has immense potential as a more rounded full-back than Alexander-Arnold with his strength in defensive duels, but it’s a huge ask to step up to being Arne Slot’s preferred right-back after only making 28 Premier League appearances.",

      "The Europa League could be their saving grace after a brilliant Mason Mount brace last week helped Ruben Amorim’s side to a 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Club to see them through to the final against Tottenham on May 21.",
      "Victory over their Premier League rivals in the final will grant them crucial entry into the Champions League next term, making United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and provide the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "Cherki has previously been linked with a move to the Premier League and CaughtOffside now claim that his agents have ‘approached’ a number of sides in the English top flight over potentially signing the Frenchman this summer.",
      "It’s claimed the 21-year-old – who came close to joining Borussia Dortmund in January – is on the radar of Manchester City, Tottenham, Newcastle, Bayern Munich, and Paris Saint-Germain, but it’s ‘Liverpool and Man Utd seemingly among the most keen to pounce for his availability’.",
      "Cherki is said to have ‘caught the eye of United in their Europa League meeting’, with his 12 goals and 18 assists this season further strengthening their resolve to make a bid as the Red Devils are ‘tempted to try a move’ for the playmaker as a ‘major upgrade’ on Marcus Rashford and Antony.",

      "It’s not clear how much United or other interested parties may have to shell out for Cherki, though reports have claimed he has a ‘verbal agreement’ with Lyon over a £25m transfer, with the Ligue 1 side likely willing to field offers given his contract expires in 2026.",

      "The report adds:",

      "Ahead of the clash, on The Overlap Fan Debate, Neville revealed his “sickly feeling about the game”.",
      "“I’ve genuinely got a sickly feeling about this game next Wednesday,” Neville said on The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "“The biggest reason is when I look at every single player in the Tottenham team, when you look at (Dejan) Kulusevski, Son (Heung-min), Brennan Johnson, (Dominic) Solanke, if (James) Maddison was there, (Yves) Bissouma and (Pape Matar) Sarr, (Cristian) Romero and (Micky) Van de Ven, (Pedro) Porro and (Destiny) Udogie, when you look at those players, like-for-like with United’s, only Bruno (Fernandes) would get into the first 11 of Spurs.",
      "“I would select every single Tottenham player. The goalkeeper is a 50-50 split because I don’t like (Guglielmo) Vicario and I’m not a fan of (Andre) Onana.",
      "“Honestly, Udogie, Porro, Van de Ven, Romero, Bissouma, Sarr, Johnson, Maddison, Solanke, Kulusevski, Son, I would choose every single player of Tottenham’s over Manchester United’s next Wednesday. That’s my worry.”",
      "He continued: “The one thing that keeps me alive – the likes of a Casemiro, a Bruno, they’ve got something in them that will step up for a one-off game, that means I think that we’ll win.",

      "“Realistically they should win it, they’ve beaten us the last three games. I think you’ll probably be the best team on the night, play really well but we’ll win.",

      "Man Utd and their owners dominate the Mailbox as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his vulture capitalism are more than a match for the Glazers.",
      "Come on, let’s have some different subjects; mail us at theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Good news\nDelighted to see that Reading have been taken over by a guy that seems, at least from the outside, interested in running a football club and that club being good at football. No community should go through losing a club, and it seemed all too possible.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe is like Gordon Gekko\nSo Lee wrote in to support Ratcliffe. Just to be clear it’s a different Lee because this Lee would only ever be caught saying Chuck Feeney is a decent billionaire (Google him, it’s a good story ) the rest are just self serving vultures.",
      "There’s a couple of things I’d like to challenge in Lee’s mail",
      "1. We don’t know if Ratcliffe will turn the club around?",
      "2. He’s a self-made billionaire",
      "Answering question 2 will actually answer question 1 so we’ll start there.",
      "There is no such thing as a self made billionaire. Every billionaire starts from a position of middle-class safety in which they have a family which funds their living costs while they build their dream, Jobs, Gates, Musk, all had it. Ratcliffe had two working class parents who had become middle class thanks to their work which gave Ratcliffe the middle class base he needed.",
      "He also got his start in petrochemicals after convincing Esso to pay for his MBA, so that’s three different people who have helped him already but like I said there is no such thing as a self made billionaire.",
      "But this doesn’t mean a billionaire doesn’t work hard, most work long hours and rarely take holidays. So did Jim. But Jim didn’t get where he is by being a brilliant engineer and inventing something amazing or even being a chemical engineer and inventing something. His wealth comes almost entirely from raising private capital which he would then use to buy struggling companies, asset stripping them and moving their headquarters to tax havens.",
      "His chemical businesses in Middlesbrough also regularly just ignore environmental warnings about air and water pollution so if the air and water is terrible – his company is a big reason why.",
      "But his general MO in every case is as follows – identify struggling business with assets which can be sold. Buy very cheap. Immediately cut staff, sell assets, change HQ to tax haven and then pocket the money while publicly claiming the business is struggling and needs to cut costs.\nSound familiar?",
      "Jim is a proud Manc and English man. So proud that he campaigned for Brexit to give Britain back to the British and then once the vote had been taken immediately moved his personal residence to Monaco so he didn’t have to pay UK taxes and support UK services and economy.",
      "Jim is not Lou Gertsner or Warren Buffet who invest in businesses to make them succeed. He’s closer to Gordon Gekko, a vulture capitalist who bends rules (or ignores them) to benefit himself while putting thousands of people out of work.",
      "Will he turn around United? Why don’t we ask the fans of OGC Nice – the other team Ratcliffe owns…",
      "He bought Nice for 100m when they were struggling financially, he immediately came in promising greatness while making massive cuts to staff. Managers last on average 14 months before being fired.",
      "In the six years before Ratcliffe bought the club nice finished in the top 4 three times. Since he bought it? 0 times. At first fans liked Jim as they saw him attending games regularly, this changed within two years especially when Jim was caught saying ‘Nice games just aren’t very interesting to him’.",
      "Today the Nice supporters often protest Jim’s ownership stating he promised a lot and never delivered anything but constant change and chaos.",
      "So my guess….is Jim probably won’t save United. But he will be en excellent bullet shield for the Glazers for a few years.\nLee (the LFC one)",
      "",
      "BBQ fine though\nIt’s simple, United don’t do parades for anything but Premier League and Champions League. Haven’t had a parade since Fergie’s last season.",
      "Kind of of a ‘nothing to see here’ situation this BBQ thing but alas that wouldn’t be clickbaity or allow for DISGRACE and EMBARRASMENT would it.",
      "In fact, United have NEVER held a parade for anything other than the Prem or Champions League… even in Fergie time…. MADNESS",
      "PATHETIC attempt at journalism lol…. AGAIN\nMoses",
      "READ: Why Manchester United must sack Amorim, sell Fernandes, appoint Moyes and raid French side",
      "",
      "Glazers have done a fine job\nHow can you say that the Glazers mismanaged their ownership of Man United? In over 20 years, with minimal input by themselves, they have made hundreds of millions of pounds in personal profit. That seems like brilliant management to me. They even managed to sell a debt ridden business with run down assets for more than they paid for it. Again astounding business.",
      "Hell, the shambles that is the football part of the business even managed to win a trophy every couple years. They can take pride in having won more in the last 20 years than the owners of all but 3 clubs in England (assuming City, ‘pool and Chelsea have actually won more).",
      "How dare you say the Glazers, who bought so much footballing pleasure to the ABU crowd over the last 2 decades are guilty of poor management. After all there are many more ABU’s than MU supporters. By any measure personal to the Glazers they have done a brilliant job of managing the club.\nMurray (life long member of the Anyone But United crowd who was saddened when the Glazers left)",
      "(Erm, they haven’t left; they still own more than 70% of the club – Ed)",
      "",
      "Pashun and wages\nFirstly, some people seem to have issues with Liverpool fans proclaiming themselves as special, or the best in the world, while also booing Trent. Whilst I’m not a fan of booing, it’s probably fair to say that far from being mutually exclusive, they probably go hand in hand.",
      "Typically, fans leave an impression not for their chat about ecumenical matters in the pre-Columbine era, but more for making a massive racket in the stadium and knowing a lot about their players. This might also be called passion and knowledge. It’s therefore no surprise when the outliers do then act like jilted lovers when a player leaves.",
      "On another matter, people often redefine their league failures by quoting where they are in the wages league table. Obviously some clubs pay more than others (I’m looking at the republic of Mancunia), but in the main, professional contracts at elite clubs can give up to 100% extra on top of base salary for hitting performance targets, so is that really any justification? It all sounds a bit chicken and egg to me. Or am I missing something?",
      "To put that sentiment more succinctly, Arsenal will be low wage payers this season because they underachieved in most metrics.\nAdam, LFC",
      "",
      "Trent and ‘family’\nFirst things first, I’m an Arsenal fan so I’m more than likely obnoxious. Just gonna say that up front so all the fans of other clubs can decide whether my opinion is worthy of reading. And yes it is about Trent.",
      "Obviously the Liverpool fans booing a man who has played an important role in winning them everything are stupid, classless, ungrateful, all that. And I also understand that fans are allowed to be stupid and classless. It’s not illegal, it doesn’t necessarily point to a problem with anybody’s character. It’s sport.",
      "You’re not a worse person for booing Trent Alexander-Arnold or for being bitter toward him. But you are stupid, classless, and ungrateful. And you probably don’t have anything in your life worth celebrating if you can’t even celebrate this wonderful footballer, and I mean that sincerely.",
      "What disturbs me about the whole thing is the justification that “he’s one of our own so it hurts more.” That if he’s part of the Liverpool “family” then it makes it even more of a betrayal. Honestly I have to wonder how you treat members of your own family if that’s how you think about it. You should want your family to leave home and spend time experiencing the world. Just because of where he’s born he has to compromise his career to make his family happy? “But we didn’t even get a fee!” Let the man have a life.",
      "I have to wonder how players like Van Dijk and Salah must feel when they see how some of these fans react to “one of our own” leaving his hometown to start a new chapter of his life. Some (often abusive) people are far more horrible to their families than the people they work with and see outside the home, so I have to wonder exactly what kind of person has this sentiment.",
      "Again, you can feel however you want. You’re not better or worse than anyone else for booing your own player (the best right back in the history of the Premier League besides Lauren of course). If you want to allow a thug and a bully like Jamie Carragher to dictate how you feel then be my guest. I’m sure plenty of people will be able to point to other clubs who have booed their own players, been horrible, etc. But I’m not talking about them.",
      "What we saw on Sunday was needlessly small and petty behavior directed toward a club legend, and I don’t think players forget things like that. You’ll never walk alone until you do.\nDeadbeat Cat Dad",
      "",
      "Ronaldo Jnr?\nAm I the only person who finds it completely mental that Cristiano Ronaldo has a 15 year old son playing for Portugal’s U15s? I guess Ronaldo still seems to be 25 in my head.",
      "No idea if the kid is good enough to make it to the men’s team, but it would be one to watch if they both played in the same match (would Sr lose his shit and dock his pocket money if Jr didn’t pass to him?)",
      "Has there ever been a father/son combo in an international match before?\nPhil, Manchester",
      "",
      "FA are actually blameless\nFurther from Paul’s mail earlier about officials not flagging offside at the time they see them, and how this could have prevented the nasty injury suffered by Awoniyi.",
      "I totally agree that the current rules/guidance isn’t necessarily correct but it had to be changed to accommodate VAR.",
      "What I don’t agree with is Paul blaming the FA. They don’t decide the rules which officials follow – it’s IFAB who do this.\nA, LFC, Montreal (stuck up for VAR recently, now the FA – something must be up with me!)",
      "",
      "Beckett is an Evertonian\nI just want to respond to Mick T, Liverpool from his comment on Evertonians and relegation. When I lived in Liverpool, I actually became good friends with a bunch of Evertonians (massive Liverpool fan here) and found them 20+ years ago to be better with the banter (Rafael Beneath Us) and all that. But I always looked at Everton as a kind of second team in my books…happy to support them 36 out of 38 games during the season, etc. But there has been a real shift in them (I blame Jordan Pickford), and they are a supremely bitter club…but also delusional (We won 2-2 at Goodison Park).",
      "And so, let Everton wish for relegation before Liverpool wins a title. I wish Everton a perpetual life of 17th place finishes, staying up on the last day forever, never getting relegated, but always that fear. A sporting equivalent of Waiting for Godot.\nJonathan, Toronto",
      "According to reports, Manchester United staff are ‘dreading even more savage cuts’ if Ruben Amorim’s side lose to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Arsenal are seemingly ‘lucky’ that they play in the Premier League and not in Portugal while Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a victim of Man Utd.",
      "Richard Keys has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has ‘ripped the heart out’ of Manchester United, who are now an ’embarrassing’ side that Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to be part ...",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men.",

      "Manchester United might need to sack Ruben Amorim, sell Bruno Fernandes, replace Andre Onana and induce a global pandemic to meet their targets next season.",
      "Despite slugging it out with Europa League final opponents Spurs to see who can embarrass themselves the most domestically, 16th-placed Manchester United have set themselves the objective of a top-six finish in 2025/26.",
      "Every Premier League club has been set a target for next season but that seems like one of the more outlandish examples.",
      "Only five times in the history of 20-team Premier League campaigns has a side improved their league position by 10 places from one season to the next. Nottingham Forest will make that a half-dozen soon enough, but what lessons can Manchester United take from the past?",
      "",
      "Aston Villa (from 16th in 2002/03 to 6th in 2003/04) – changed managers\n“I had another year left on my contract and I was under no pressure to resign as Aston Villa manager,” said Graham Taylor. “But I have become increasingly unhappy at how the club as a whole was run,” he added, never naming infamous chairman Doug Ellis but leaving little doubt as to his reasoning either.",
      "Having broken his managerial retirement after nine months at the beck and call of a panicking Villa in February 2002, Taylor should perhaps have consulted predecessor John Gregory about the business practises of his new boss.",
      "But Taylor was lured back to the West Midlands in what he would later state he always knew was a “transitional” role. A record of 19 wins from 60 games saw Villa lurch from 8th one season to 16th in his first and only full campaign, before a jump back up to 6th under his replacement.",
      "David O’Leary had been out of work for a year after leaving trophyless Leeds, but an exciting crop of Villa academy graduates dovetailed wonderfully with the experience of Dion Dublin, Ronny Johnsen, Nolberto Solano and Juan Pablo Angel to turn relegation battlers into European qualification contenders.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Make Ruben Amorim quit; he genuinely doesn’t seem far off anyway.",
      "",
      "Everton (from 17th in 2003/04 to 4th in 2004/05) – sold best player\n“I sold Wayne Rooney and Everton got better,” was how David Moyes allayed any concerns West Ham might have had over losing prized asset Declan Rice. And frankly it was powerful logic: they avoided relegation by six points with him as their top scorer, Manchester United handed £27m over after Euro 2004 and Everton used those funds to help qualify for the Champions League.",
      "It does skip past a few key points, like the signing of Tim Cahill, the partnership between David Weir and Alan Stubbs and the form of Lee Carsley. But fundamentally Everton improved as a team when they cashed in on their star player.",
      "Only Norwich (3rd in 1992/93) have ever finished higher in the Premier League with a negative goal difference than the Toffees, who scored the same number of goals when finishing 4th as they did to come 17th, while only actually suffering four fewer defeats.",
      "Even when they chucked their new-found transfer weight around it backfired, but without Rooney at least Thomas Gravesen could finally spread his wings.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Sell Bruno Fernandes, and maybe sign Marcus Bent.",
      "",
      "Fulham (from 17th in 2007/08 to 7th in 2008/09) – signed competent keeper\nIt remains one of the more unlikely relegation escapes in Premier League history, perhaps a little lost in the mire of Derby selfishly and simultaneously recording their Apocalypse Season.",
      "Fulham were already 18th and in trouble when they appointed Roy Hodgson as Lawrie Sanchez’s successor in December 2007. But their struggle to build any momentum left them in this spot heading into the final straight:",
      "The Cottagers then trailed Manchester City 2-0 within 21 minutes of the first of those three must-win games. Yet they did precisely that, Diomansy Kamara capping a ludicrous comeback in stoppage time at the Etihad before Birmingham and Portsmouth were felled for no apparent reason.",
      "Fulham’s eagerness to avoid a similar scenario meant a substantial summer spend, with Andy Johnson, Bobby Zamora, John Paintsil and Zoltan Gera among those signed. But it was free agent Mark Schwarzer, released by Middlesbrough, who rejected Juventus and Bayern Munich to move to west London.",
      "Perhaps a full pre-season of Hodgson’s double training sessions of two banks of four was actually the decisive factor but Fulham went from conceding 60 goals in 2007/08 to letting in only 34 in 2008/09, fewer than Arsenal and indeed every team bar the top three, with Schwarzer equalling a record for most clean sheets in a Premier League season for the Cottagers which still stands.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? It’s not great news for Andre Onana.",
      "",
      "Leicester (from 14th in 2014/15 to 1st in 2015/16) – changed managers but also signed probably the league’s best player from France’s mid-table\nThere is little point in trying to dilute and replicate any element of Leicester’s title-winning season, but also Manchester United should probably sack Amorim after his son is embroiled in a racist sex tape scandal before appointing a likeable but ill-suited manager, being widely tipped for relegation and capitalising on the collective bed-soiling of the usual contenders.",
      "It might also be an idea to identify one of the most effective players in Premier League history, going entirely unnoticed in Ligue Un at a ludicrously low price. Leicester, unbeknownst to everyone including themselves, already had most of the pieces in place to win the title, but N’Golo Kante, a £5.6m signing from Caen, made director of football Steve Walsh perhaps the sport’s most coveted man.",
      "Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas? And does Nigel Pearson calling a journalist an ostrich trigger a series of events which culminates in Andrea Bocelli belting out Nessun Dorma at a disbelieving King Power Stadium?",

      "",
      "West Ham (from 16th in 2019/20 to 6th in 2020/21) – stopped playing in front of fans\nWhile the instinct is to wipe the entire sorry saga from memory, those months in which Jesse Lingard and Tomas Soucek were the single greatest footballers on earth were at least a novelty. A great many things would not have happened without lockdown and West Ham almost qualifying for the Champions League is chief among them.",
      "From the date of the first game without fans in June 2020 to May 2021, when heavy restrictions were still placed on attendance, only five teams accrued more points than West Ham, who trailed Arsenal on goal difference alone.",
      "Considering their plight beforehand it was a ludicrous turnaround. Moyes was again the architect of a huge leap in places but he struggled after replacing Manuel Pellegrini and things only started to click when Michail Antonio was free to chase long balls and run the channels without fear of being chastised by supporters.",

      "",
      "14) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",

      "RB Leipzig have been informed that star midfielder Xavi Simons wants to leave the club this summer, with the Premier League looking like his next destination.",
      "The Dutch international, 22, joined Leipzig on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last year before the Bundesliga side made the deal permanent for around £42m.",
      "But just five months after that agreement, Simons has told the club he’s ready for a new challenge.",
      "Fabrizio Romano confirmed the development on social media this week, reporting: “Xavi Simons’ decision has been made: he’s ready to leave RB Leipzig this summer.",
      "Plan confirmed as reported in recent months — he’s ready for a new chapter with top Premier League clubs and Bayern all attentive to his situation. RB Leipzig are aware of the player’s plan.”",
      "That will come as no surprise to a host of English clubs. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City and Man Utd have long been tracking Simons, while Bayern Munich are also believed to be watching closely.",
      "However, Leipzig’s asking price and Simons’ preference for a Premier League move put English sides firmly in the frame.",
      "Reports suggest Leipzig want a quick and sizeable return on their January investment, with the Bundesliga side expected to demand around €80 million (£67m).",
      "A sizeable fee, but one that won’t deter top-tier Premier League interest, particularly with Simons’ consistent output at the top level.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Reds repeat: Liverpool the overwhelming F365 favourites to win a 21st title…\n👉 Man Utd are ‘financial shambles’ but are still bigger than Liverpool!\n👉 Arsenal win the title, Leeds survive, Liverpool’s new dynasty – a 2025/26 target for each Premier League club",
      "The Netherlands international has nine goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga this season, despite Leipzig enduring an up-and-down campaign.",
      "Last term, he registered 25 goal contributions across all competitions and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.",
      "Speaking recently, Simons hinted at his future, telling Sky Germany: “I’m still a young player, I have many dreams and the club knows that. But right now, the most important thing for me is to play well in the upcoming games. Then we have the international matches, and after that we’ll sit down and see what happens.”",
      "Simons’ desire to play Champions League football is thought to be a key factor in his decision. Leipzig are currently seventh in the Bundesliga, with their hopes of qualifying for next season’s competition all but over.",
      "That could give the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool the edge. Man Utd are also interested, but their financial flexibility may depend on Europa League success and the Champions League qualification that comes with it, as revealed by Duncan Castles recently.",
      "He said: “Their problem is an obvious one in that they don’t have much money to play with, certainly not the kind of money that Leipzig are looking at as a sell fee.",
      "They will need to win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League to be able to afford such a deal. But he’s on a list of players that they’re looking at.”",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot is the “driving force” behind a move to sign RB Leipzig star Xavi Simons in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United and Liverpool are reportedly battling to sign Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig this summer and a report has ‘confirmed’ the €80m star’s transfer destination this summer.",
      "Man Utd have made a huge offer to sign RB Leipzig attacking midfielder Xavi Simons ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons but must hit ‘jackpot’ of Champions League qualification to sign him.",
      "Arsenal have had a look at RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons and could make a move for the Dutchman in the summer, according to journalist Charles Watts.",
      "Barcelona have opened the door for Man Utd to make a move for RB Leipzig attacking midfielder Xavi Simons, according to reports."

      "An \"embarrassed\" Ruben Amorim has claimed there is \"something wrong\" with the way his Manchester United side play football ahead of their meeting with Chelsea, live on Friday Night Football.",
      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",
      "\"We need to feel that. We need to get angry with the critics and perform. The worst thing we can do is let it go, that is so hard to understand.\""

      "Thursday 15 May 2025 23:44, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has played his last game for Aston Villa - for now, at least - after Unai Emery confirmed injury would keep him out against Tottenham. The forward is ineligible to face Manchester United on the final day, so attention now turns to his future.",
      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",
      "It is too close to call with two games to go in the hunt for the top five...",
      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",
      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",
      "Opta's supercomputer has given them a 38 per cent chance of breaking into the Champions League spots.",
      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",
      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",
      "\"I don't see Newcastle beating Arsenal away and then they have to beat Everton, a difficult team to play against.",

      "Fresh from a 7/1 winning double, our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his Premier League insight and sees problems for Chelsea on Friday Night Football.",
      "Tottenham going off 7/1 with Sky Bet for the away win tells you all you need to know about their prospects in this fixture. It's the biggest price they've been by a long way vs a non-big six team in the last 10 years.",
      "Even if you added another zero to that 7/1, I'd be tempted to swerve it.",
      "Villa have a goal in sight and have been relentless in their pursuit of a top-five finish, winning seven of their last eight Premier League games. They've crashed the markets and the top five party and are now just 11/10 with Sky Bet to finish there.",
      "Pro-Villa angles are the only betting angles to consider across the props markets and with Jacob Ramsey (suspended) and Youri Tielemans (injured) out for this fixture, backing Boubacar Kamara's shots lines makes appeal based on he could be playing with attacking licence.",
      "He did last weekend in the win at Bournemouth, hitting two shots, which is way above his season per 90 average of 0.44. It's 4/1 with Sky Bet for him to repeat the feat and register two or more shots.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's suspension makes this fixture trickier for Chelsea than the 1/3 odds with Sky Bet imply. Jackson has played his last game of this season following that red card at Newcastle and it leaves Enzo Maresca with a huge issue at centre-forward.",
      "Jackson has missed seven Premier League matches for Chelsea this season, they've lost four of those matches against Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Ipswich, scoring just one goal along the way. A criticism of Maresca this season has been the predictability of Chelsea's play and that is more apparent when you remove Jackson from the equation as he does bring a bit of surprise and directness to what Chelsea are trying to serve up.",
      "Goals could be hard to come by for Maresca's team without their focal point in attack and when you throw in Manchester United's inability to put the ball in the net along with what is lurking on the horizon for them on Wednesday in Bilbao, the goal line set by the markets feels too high.",
      "United have failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton, Everton (both 15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more. Since December 22 they have scored just 21 Premier League goals in their 20 games. The under 2.5 goals line is a big price at 13/8 with Sky Bet considering all the correct scores you get on your side.",
      "Opposing goals in matches at Wembley remains a sustainable long-term betting strategy.",
      "It might be the mecca of English football - to play there is every footballer's dream - but I'm convinced the place saps the momentum out of a game. Maybe the jeopardy of what is at stake plays a part which in turn leads to low-scoring football matches but I think games there rarely spark into life.",
      "The last 46 domestic and European matches played at Wembley, the average goals per 90 stands at 1.98 goals in normal time and if you backed the under 3.5 line in those 45 games, you'd have won 42 times. Yes, the prices on offer for under 3.5 goals are quite tight but a return at that strike rate means you'd be swimming in profit if backing that line blind.",
      "If you back Crystal Palace +1 handicap (double chance) and under 3.5 goals through the RequestABet function with Sky Bet you have a juicy 7/4 shot on your side with Sky Bet.",
      "The Grand Old Lady is set to belt out one final tune and if previous farewell games at stadiums are anything to go by, there should be two things on the menu: a home win and lots of goals.",
      "The final games at Upton Park, Highbury, The Dell, Griffin Park and White Hart Lane all ended with the home team signing off in style with a win and a total of 23 goals scored in those five matches.",
      "Meanwhile, only Sheffield Utd (97 in 23/24) and Swindon (85 in 93/94) have conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League season than Southampton, so Everton couldn't have wished for a more welcoming visitor on goodbye Goodison day.",
      "Everton to win and over 2.5 goals at 11/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play.",
      "The market has got completely carried away with Nottingham Forest here. Just because they need to win, it doesn't always work out like that.",
      "Taking a price as short as 6/4 with Sky Bet on a Forest win makes little sense based on what Nuno Espirito Santo's team has been serving up for the past 12 Premier League games.",
      "Across those 12 games their expected goals against process is working at 1.68 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process. They allowed Leicester to create 1.29 worth of expected goals and score twice, so West Ham with Jarrod Bowen and Mohamed Kudus bringing top quality final third to the table, should be confident of scoring multiple goals.",
      "Bowen has five goals or assists in his last four starts and looks overpriced to grab another one at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brentford don't want the season to end. They've lost just two of their last 12 Premier League games, winning the last four for the first time in the top-flight since 1939.",
      "Only Liverpool, Newcastle, Man City and Arsenal have scored more goals in the league this season (63) with the Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa combination so exciting to watch.",
      "The Bees can sting you from all angles though, including set pieces where the addition of Michael Kayode and his excellent long-throw has given them an extra attacking dimension. Sepp van den Berg is the beneficiary of these clever set pieces and he's had eight shots from his last 10 starts when playing centre-back. He is 8/11 with Sky Bet for another shot.",
      "Sometimes the narrative is just too powerful to ignore.",
      "Jamie Vardy will make his 500th and final appearance for Leicester here and will not feature in the season finale at Liverpool next Sunday to allow him a King Power Stadium farewell.",
      "He will be celebrated before and after kick-off as the club finish their home campaign in a battle between two already relegated clubs.",
      "With nothing on the line this could turn into a bit of Vardy sideshow and he is no stranger to grabbing the limelight. He is searching for his 200th goal for Leicester too. His 5/4 anytime goalscorer price is an obvious starting point but boosting it up by taking the 4/1 with Sky Bet on him scoring the last goal of the game makes sense.",
      "Some things are just meant to be.",
      "The draw at 5/2 with Sky Bet must be of interest based on it suiting both teams. If this rolls past 70 minutes with the scores level we could get a drifty end that peters out.",
      "Newcastle know a point will be just fine for their prospects as they'd have Champions League qualification firmly in their hands heading into the final day knowing a win over Everton at home would secure a top-five finish.",
      "Meanwhile, you get the feeling Mikel Arteta and his boys just want the season to end now. Arsenal have dropped 18 points in their last 11 Premier League games, winning just three times and have been beaten by the Toon on three occasions already this season. A draw is fine for them in terms of finishing second with only Southampton to come for them.",
      "Taking a view on player cards in end-of-season games isn't an ideal punting strategy but we've got a full-back here who is in an aggressive mood.",
      "Conor Bradley is a man looking to take his chance following Trent Alexander-Arnold's decision to move on and his ability to play calm and composed isn't going to be helped by the transfer move for Jeremie Frimpong. Bradley does still look quite reckless and raw at times, making five fouls and being carded on both in his last two starts. He's 5/2 with Sky Bet to pick up another booking.",

      "Ruben Amorim strikes a different tone about his Manchester United future ahead of Europa League final against Tottenham and insists he has \"clear plan\" about how to turn the club around a few days after saying he could resign next season if dreadful Premier League performances continue",
      "Thursday 15 May 2025 11:51, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has said he is far from quitting as Manchester United boss after warning he could walk away if results do not improve next season.",
      "Amorim was \"embarrassed\" after West Ham came to Old Trafford and won for the first time in nine matches to move above United, whose dreadful Premier League campaign has left them 16th in the table after losing 17 games.",
      "The United boss warned that everyone at the club must \"seriously think about a lot of things\" before saying they should \"give space to other people\" if the poor form continues after the summer.",
      "But Amorim insisted in his press conference ahead of next Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham that he has no plans to step down.",
      "Asked if he would seriously resign, Amorim said: \"I am far from quitting.\"",
      "\"What I am saying is that since I arrived here I am always talking about the standards. I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and not say something and take responsibility,\" he added.",
      "\"I have a clear plan of what to do. I understand the problems of the team.\"",
      "But the United boss, far more upbeat than in the aftermath of the defeat to West Ham, warned \"we need to perform or else they will change us\".",
      "Amorim also confirmed he had agreed to pay for his backroom staff to go to next week's Europa League final after reports claimed the club would not be covering the cost of their tickets.",
      "This is just the latest cost-cutting measure implemented under United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen more than 400 redundancies since taking control of football operations from the Glazer family.",
      "Amorim, who acknowledged it is \"hard to manage things\" at United, said the cut-backs made it difficult for the club to pay for those staff still in a job.",
      "\"We have had a lot of people leaving and a lot of changes in our staff,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"In our club at the moment it is sometimes hard to understand when to take and when to give and to respect the people when we have taken their jobs to survive and rebuild.",
      "\"It is complicated for the club to give to other members of staff, so it is a really hard position.",
      "\"That situation was explained and my reaction was to help because - I am not a good guy - it is not going to change my life. The players had the same reaction.",
      "\"Everybody wants the staff and the families there.\"",
      "Amorim says injured United defenders Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Diogo Dalot are pushing to feature in next week's Europa League final.",
      "Yoro joined fellow centre-backs De Ligt and Heaven on the sidelines after limping off in Sunday's 2-0 loss to West Ham with a foot injury.",
      "The trio were absent from training just a week out from facing Spurs and head coach Amorim said: \"I don't know if they are going to be available.",
      "\"We are going to try to push because it's the final matches and this is a final, you know that. All the players want to play that really bad, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think they will not go to Chelsea [on Friday], but we will have a possibility to have some of them in the final.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are ruled out of the match against Tottenham next Wednesday.",
      "Jonny Evans and Toby Collyer were in training a week out from the final, while full-back Dalot did an individual session before the main group trained as he seeks to make it to Spain.",
      "The 26-year-old has made 51 appearances for United this term in all competitions but last month suffered a potentially season-ending calf injury.",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad,\" Amorim said. \"I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, second injury [follows] and then it's a big thing.",
      "\"We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad, so we will see but he's working really hard to get in the final.\"",
      "\"I am working really hard, you can imagine how much I want to be back as soon as possible,\" he said."

      "Paul Merson has criticised Manchester United's decision not to hold an open-top bus parade if they go on to lift the Europa League trophy.",
      "They would instead hold a small celebration. It has been reported that would be in the form of a barbecue at the club's training ground.",
      "United did not organise a bus parade when they won the Europa League in 2017, the FA Cup in 2016 and 2024, or for the Carabao Cup triumphs in 2017 and 2023.",
      "\"The trophies do not come thick and fast,\" Merson said. \"Man Utd are a million miles off. Enjoy it (trophies) while you can.",
      "\"For me, it's a bit of arrogance.",
      "\"Winning trophies was the past, so enjoy the present. Who says they win another one for 15 years?",
      "\"Now they're going to have a BBQ, think of the fans! They'll let you know when the parade is on whether it was right to do. Do not leave the fans out because it is about the fans.",
      "\"I would want a parade. They could win a trophy and if they win it, they have won more than Arsenal. Arsenal would love to have a parade. It is hard to win trophies, so do not underestimate winning one. It is difficult.\"",
      "Man Utd suffered their 17th top-flight defeat against West Ham in their last outing, with nine of these losses arriving at Old Trafford, and Ruben Amorim will now be tasked with picking his side up in a bid to salvage the campaign with silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim believes he knows \"what the team needs to be so much better\" as he looks to address the \"unacceptable\" position the club finds itself in next season.",
      "\"I'm really embarrassed that in 25 games, we've won six. Something is wrong in the way we are playing football, and sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically and technically.",
      "\"It's the way we face competition and the way we suffer and the way we get mad because we are losing, and the way we protect the goal.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if we can change our position in the league or not - that feeling is nothing about confidence. It's about the belief and the understanding that we are Manchester United, and we don't want to be the worst in the league.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable and, for me, that is not a lack of confidence, that is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "In the build-up to Friday's penultimate league game against Chelsea and the final against Tottenham, United centre-backs Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven have all sat out training.",
      "Amorim could be dealing with a depleted backline against Spurs, judging by United's open training session at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Yoro limped off during Sunday's 2-0 home defeat to West Ham with a foot problem and was conspicuous by his absence at training, as was De Ligt after picking up an issue at Brentford the previous weekend.",
      "Heaven did individual work ahead of last week's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao but was not seen at Wednesday's session, in which Jonny Evans took part along with Toby Collyer.",
      "Diogo Dalot did an individual session before the main group trained as he seeks to make the final, but Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are out for the remainder of the season.",
      "Former United defender Patrice Evra has called the Europa League final a \"crucial moment in the history of the club\" to salvage a disastrous campaign.",
      "\"I love his honesty. I want him to succeed but of course, the results are really bad this season.",
      "\"It's a process. It's his first year, I see a lot of improvement. Even when I arrived, I had six months to adapt.",
      "\"It would be good to play Champions League due to the player we can attract. It's [Europa League final] a crucial moment for the history of the club.",
      "\"Bruno Fernandes is the most important player in the team. If he wasn't there we wouldn't be in the final and it could have been possible [relegation].",
      "\"We have to forget this season. I am confident but it will be tough. Good luck to both teams but come on Man Utd!\""

      "Wednesday 14 May 2025 14:52, UK",

      "\"Liam Delap could be the bargain buy of the summer.",
      "\"The striker has hit double figures for goals in his first full crack at the Premier League and that is even more impressive considering the struggles his relegated Ipswich have had at this level.",
