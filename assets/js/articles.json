      "Manchester United have made contact with Aston Villa regarding the signing of Ollie Watkins as they search for a new forward. The Red Devils are determined to improve their frontline this summer following a dismal campaign.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves, while they are still attempting to get a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo over the line. A more traditional centre-forward is also on their list.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike have both been linked but little progress has been made in pursuit of the duo. But now, it appears that United have a target a little closer to home.",
      "According to The Athletic, Aston Villa’s Watkins has been added to their list of possible striker signings. It is reported that contact between United and Villa chiefs has already been made via intermediaries to explore the conditions of a deal.",
      "Conversations initially surfaced ahead of Marcus Rashford’s loan move to the Midlands but did not progress any further. Watkins is seen as a potential replacement for Rasmus Hojlund should he leave amid interest from Inter Milan.",
      "Speaking about his future last month, the Danish forward said: \"I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.",
      "\"I know I can't get much out of reading things. I know what the facts are, and that is that I have a contract with Manchester United until 2030. I expect to play there, so I'm just getting ready for some summer vacation and then hopefully a good pre-season.\"",
      "As it stands, a move to Old Trafford is not close for Watkins despite a sale being beneficial for Villa’s PSR calculations. He was ironically on United's list of options in 2023 but they instead decided to move for Hojlund, who has endured a tricky time of things.",
      "The Red Devils would prefer to sell the Dane and have accepted that they might have to accept a figure lower than his perceived value. Meanwhile, Villa value Watkins at around £60m given there is still three years remaining on his contract.",
      "That price will not be particularly easy for United to pay though. Premier League rivals Arsenal previously baulked at that figure in January having also held talks. They reportedly valued him at around £40m.",
      "Watkins enjoyed another standout season for Villa last term despite having temporarily been ousted by Jhon Duran ahead of his move to Saudi Arabia. The 29-year-old scored 17 goals and notched 14 assists in all competitions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Once a highly-touted talent at Manchester United, Timothy Fosu-Mensah hasn't played a game of football in two years. The 27-year-old climbed the ranks of the Red Devils youth academy between 2014 and 2016, even earning a nomination for Tuttosport's Golden Boy award alongside Marcus Rashford - despite being restricted to just three starts and four substitute appearances under Jose Mourinho in his debut season.",
      "Neither Fosu-Mensah nor Rashford clinched the title of best young player in Europe, which ultimately was awarded to Kylian Mbappe after his 15-goal and 11-assist season with Monaco. Despite being nominated for the award, which is typically a good indicator of a promising future, Fosu-Mensah's career has largely failed to meet expectations.",
      "The defensive midfielder clocked up just 30 games in total for United during his tenure, spending loan spells with the likes of Crystal Palace and Fulham instead of carving out his path with the Red Devils. A knee ligament injury in April 2019 while on loan at Craven Cottage also kept him out for the better part of a year, further hampering opportunities to make an early impact in his career.",
      "Fosu-Mensah's move to Bayer Leverkusen in January 2021 for a fee rumoured to be around £1.5million was seen as a fresh start, but his hopes were dashed just a month later due to another ligament injury.",
      "His final outing for Leverkusen was an 11-minute cameo against RB Leipzig in April 2023, and he didn't feature at all during Leverkusen's title-winning 2023/24 season. Despite this, Fosu-Mensah is optimistic about reigniting his career in 2025/26 provided he finds the right club.",
      "Speaking to PA, he said: \"Last season was the first time in my career that I've spent without a team. At this age, it's quite early and I think quite strange for people. I know I've been working hard and hard work won't go unnoticed.",
      "\"That's what I believe. If you stay at home, you do nothing and then you think, 'Boom, OK, I'm going to go this club or that club', no, that's not how it works, that's not my mentality. It's definitely a fresh start and I've been working hard.\"",
      "Reflecting on his time without a club, he added: \"There was a couple of situations with agents here and there, which was a bit of a mess. People were speaking on my name who I never even had contact with. I would say like 80 per cent of the agents who were approaching clubs and people I didn't even know, who I didn't even had contact with. I think that was a big mess.\"",
      "There were talks of Fosu-Mensah heading to the Championship this winter, but he chose instead to train with Ajax reserves for five months with hopes of boosting his fitness. Elsewhere, Fosu-Mensah shared an enduring affection for Manchester United, saying that despite his career taking a different path from the north west.",
      "He added: \"I came there when I was 16, I left when I was 23. I've had many nice moments, won a couple of trophies, especially in my first season. We all know United, we all know the history of United, we all know what United stands for.\""

      "Unai Emery’s side had managed to negotiate a £40m option to buy him permanently. Rashford, 27, performed relatively well at Villa Park having scored four goals and notched six assists in 17 appearances before his season was curtailed by injury.",
      "It was previously reported that Villa were set to pass up the chance to keep him, something that they have now confirmed in a statement. They have announced that Rashford has returned to Old Trafford, while fellow loanees Marco Asensio and Axel Disasi have been sent back to Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea respectively.",
      "A club statement read: “Marco Asensio, Marcus Rashford and Axel Disasi each joined Villa in February on loan deals until the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "“Attacking midfielder Asensio enjoyed 21 outings in claret and blue, scoring eight goals, including three across both legs of our UEFA Champions League Round of 16 tie against Club Brugge.",
      "“Forward Rashford made 17 appearances for the club and registered a total of nine goal contributions across all competitions, bagging a brace in our FA Cup quarter-final against Preston North End.",
      "“Defender Disasi arrived from Chelsea and made 10 appearances for Villa, his first coming against Ipswich Town in mid-February. Everyone at Aston Villa would like to thank each of the players for their efforts and amazing commitment to the club and wish them all the very best for the future.”",
      "Meanwhile, Villa have also confirmed that both Robin Olsen and Kourtney Hause have departed the club at the end of their respective deals. Villa’s decision over Rashford now leaves him in a slightly uncomfortable position.",
      "He appears to have little future under Amorim, while he is unwilling to take a cut to his lofty wage packet. Rashford has interest in a move to Barcelona, with the Catalans also admirers but their financial situation could make a move slightly tricky.",
      "Rashford has three years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. His former United teammate Timothy Fosu-Mensah recently shared his thoughts on Rashford’s situation.",
      "He told the Independent: “I just want him to be happy. Everybody just wants him to be happy. The most important things is for him to feel good, for him to feel happy. Look, the quality is definitely there. Nobody needs to say anything about this quality, because he’s a top player.”",

      "It's yet to be seen who else United will pursue before the transfer window shuts on 1 September. However, when it comes to departures, at least nine players are certain to leave the club this summer.",

Ruben Amorim is desperate for new recruits, after losing the Europa League final and finishing 15th in the Premier League.",
      "United are always busy in the transfer window, but their success record in recent years has not been strong.",
      "The likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Antony have each arrived for huge money, but have failed to hit the heights they did at their previous clubs. While many United fans will pick holes in various deals that have been made, they will be equally disappointed with the targets who have got away.",
      "In his final season at Tottenham Hotspur, Harry Kane overtook Jimmy Greaves to become Spurs' record goalscorer, before stating Alan Shearer's Premier League record was next in his sights. With Manchester City signing Erling Haaland, Liverpool buying Cody Gakpo at the time and Spurs generally being reluctant to sell star players to Chelsea and Arsenal, United looked to have a clear route to Kane.",
      "However, Benni McCarthy, who was part of Erik ten Hag's backroom team at Old Trafford at the time, revealed the club were put off by his nine-figure transfer fee.",
      "Speaking at Ladbrokes' launch of the Gaffer of all Accas, McCarthy said: \"Harry Kane was Erik's No.1 target. Erik really wanted him. Kolo Muani was also very high on that list. Victor Osimhen was also on that list. But I felt that if you're going to want to spend that kind of money – £100million-plus – then you want the complete package. And Harry Kane, for me, was the complete package.",
      "\"But unfortunately, the club didn't see it that way. They looked at it as Rasmus Hojlund in the long run would be a more prized asset than investing in both Rasmus and Harry Kane. So we stopped pursuing Kane and we ended up getting just Rasmus.\"",
      "Kane left for Bayern Munich that summer, having scored 213 Premier League goals – just 47 short of Shearer's record of 260.",
      "In 2015, Muller was heavily linked with a move to United, who were managed by Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman was one of Muller's first managers at Bayern Munich and a reunion was potentially on the cards.",
      "However, the German international was one of Bayern's most important players. Even a world record equalling £80m bid from United did not budge the Bundesliga heavyweight's resolve.",
      "Looking back on the rumours, Muller has previously said: \"Things were serious when Van Gaal came in [for me] in 2015, for all sides involved. I could imagine going to United then.",
      "\"But the club said, 'We want you to stay.’ I wasn’t out of contract, that’s why it was pretty clear-cut in the end.”",
      "Very briefly, Declan Rice was the most expensive transfer in Premier League history when he decided to join Arsenal in 2023. Before he moved to the Emirates Stadium, United were constantly linked with him.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously revealed that he and other officials at the Red Devils discussed a move for the ex-West Ham United captain.",
      "The Norwegian previously told The Stick to Football podcast: \"We discussed him a few times and I think we would have done well with him in midfield.",
      "\"I think he improved a lot on his playmaking as well. Obviously he would have cost some money, but we could have and should have gone for him.”",
      "United had inside-knowledge of Erling Haaland when the forward was still a little known teenager in Norway. That came courtesy of Solskjaer, who was managing Molde when Haaland was a barely known young prodigy.",
      "Before he even returned to Old Trafford, Solskjaer told his former side to snap him up as soon as possible. The ex-United boss said: \"I had him in Molde, for two seasons more or less. The summer before I got here [in Manchester], I rang the club and said, 'You’ve got to sign this boy. He’ll be absolutely top class.'",
      "\"That was June, July 2018, and they said, 'No.' Then I became caretaker manager and Molde had sold Haaland to RB Salzburg. I told the club, 'Buy him straightaway, before he plays,' because he didn't play for them for three or four months. 'Just sign him now because he's got a release clause.'",
      "\"We knew that then, and no-one else would’ve paid that money – €20m (£17.2m) it would’ve been a bargain. It was the club’s decision to not go for him then. We never made bids or went in for him, until after they realised, when he started scoring for Salzburg. By then Dortmund were there, Juventus were there, everyone was there.”",
      "After a disappointing first transfer window as United manager, David Moyes started looking towards the future, where he envisioned a starting eleven with Toni Kroos in the midfield. Moyes missed out on many top targets in his first summer, including the likes of Gareth Bale, Cesc Fabregas and Arturo Vidal, and had to settle with just Marouane Fellaini arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "In 2014, Moyes started a charm offensive with Kroos, that worked, as they agreed a verbal agreement for him to join. Kroos said: \"I knew that Manchester United wanted me and Moyes underlined that absolutely. It was a really nice afternoon with very nice people. We talked a lot about United’s footballing plan which convinced me. In the end, we agreed verbally. So it was close, I almost went to United.\"",

      "It's no surprise to hear footballer's are shopped around to clubs. It may not even be a surprise to know it happens without their knowledge.",
      "But that parties players don't even know are attempting to speak to clubs on their behalf, indicates the opportunism present sometimes in the transfer market. Former Manchester United youngster Timothy Fosu-Mensah has learned as much in his year without a club.",
      "The 27-year-old, who first made his name with the Red Devils under Louis van Gaal, last played for Bayer Leverkusen in April 2023 before leaving the club the following year having failed to make an appearance in their title-winning season under Xabi Alonso. And following that Fosu-Mensah has spent 12 months as a free agent and learned about a new aspect of the footballing world.",
      "The defender has experienced plenty of difficulties in his career. The Dutchman has been impacted by managerial changes — Van Gaal was replaced by Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford who spoke of 'great potential” and promised 'plenty of opportunities' before offering just one Premier League start in a season — seen a loan opportunity end via a horrific cruciate ligament injury and most recently failed to find a club after being shown the door by Leverkusen.",
      "And as a result of that final blow, Fosuh-Mensah has found himself the subject of agent talks despite never coming into contact with the representatives himself. It's a situation that he has deemed a 'mess'",
      "\"There was a couple of situations with agents here and there, which was a bit of a mess,\" he said. \"People were speaking on my name who I never even had contact with.",
      "\"I would say like 80 per cent of the agents who were approaching clubs and people I didn’t even know, who I didn’t even had contact with. I think that was a big mess.\"",
      "That period included talks with Championship clubs. “Some of them I was aware of, some of them I wasn’t,” Fosu-Mensah added.",
      "The defender, who saw spells on loan with Crystal Palace and Fulham while at United, has spent time training with boyhood Ajax in recent months to ensure fitness. And despite his experiences, is confident he will find a new team to represent.",
      "“Last season was the first time in my career that I’ve spent without a team,” Fosu-Mensah said. “At this age it’s quite early and I think quite strange for people.",
      "“I know I’ve been working hard and hard work won’t go unnoticed. That’s what I believe.",
      "“If you stay at home, you do nothing and then you think ‘boom, OK, I’m going to go this club or that club’, no, that’s not how it works, that’s not my mentality. It’s definitely a fresh start and I’ve been working hard.”",

      "Borussia Dortmund midfielder Felix Nmecha has been linked with a move to Manchester United. He would already be familiar with his surroundings, having spent much of his youth career with Manchester City.",
      "Nmecha was signed by Dortmund for around £25million (€30m) from Werder Bremen in 2023. While injury limited his game time during his debut campaign, the versatile centre midfielder has made 39 appearances this season and impressed for Dortmund at the Club World Cup, which could prompt a return to the Premier League.",
      "The 24-year-old, whose older brother Lukas also rose through the ranks at City, featured three times during his stint with Pep Guardiola’s side. However, Nmecha eventually swapped England for Germany at both club and international level, having previously represented the Three Lions’ age-group sides.",
      "Caught Offside has reported that United are interested in bringing Nmecha to Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to rebuild his team. Dortmund are on the verge of selling Jamie Gittens to Chelsea but are said to be unwilling to cash in on Nmecha.",
      "Whether Nmecha does complete a move to Old Trafford remains to be seen, but Guardiola was aware of the player’s potential before he left City in 2021. After a win over Oxford United in the Carabao Cup, Guardiola name-checked Nmecha as one of three players to watch out for, despite not handing the then-17-year-old his debut.",
      "\"Eric Garcia played amazing in pre-season and Felix Nmecha is a guy who has a good perspective too. Today Adria [Bernabe] played some minutes. It depends on them but if they have quality in some moments they can show us they can play.\"",
      "Nmecha was eventually given his first team bow in the second leg of City’s semi-final with Burton Albion, which Guardiola’s team started with a 9-0 advantage. Despite the lack of jeopardy, Nmecha was again one of several players praised by the City boss.",
      "The City academy graduate ultimately struggled to earn more first team opportunities. He registered a Champions League assist during a brief cameo against Olympiacos in 2020 and was named in his sole Premier League matchday squad later that year.",
      "However, it took Nmecha little time to prove himself after leaving City and reuniting with his brother Lukas at Werder Bremen. In January 2022, Sport Bible reported that England were at risk of losing Nmecha, who had played for the Three Lions from U16 to U19 level.",
      "The midfielder was said to be in talks with the German federation over declaring for the country. His older brother Lukas had made the same switch after playing for England U21s. The warning proved to be prescient for Gareth Southgate, who had also failed to convince Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala to continue representing England a year earlier.",
      "The younger Nmecha made his Germany U21 debut in March 2022 and became a senior international 12 months later. He currently has four caps for Germany..",
      "A move to United this summer would represent another type of synergy for the Nmecha brothers. Lukas, 26, recently sealed a return to England by signing for newly-promoted Leeds United as a free agent.",

Pogba, who left United in 2022, has joined the Ligue 1 side to end his two-year absence from football, having been banned for 18 months because of a doping offence.",
      "The Frenchman has signed a two-year deal with Monaco, having had his contract with Juventus terminated midway through his suspension. Sancho, 25, could follow Pogba in finding a new club this summer, as he appears to have no long-term future at Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea opted not to sign him permanently following an unconvincing loan spell, scoring five goals and laying on eight assists in 41 appearances. The Blues even paid United a £5million penalty fee in order to avoid having to go through with their £25m obligation to buy him at the end of last season.",
      "The winger is due to return for pre-season training next month at Carrington, where he'll work under Ruben Amorim ahead of their tour of the USA. In the meantime, Sancho is on holiday and had time to send Pogba a message.",
      "On Instagram, his former team-mate had shared an image himself in a Monaco shirt. Sancho reposted the snap and wrote: \"PP is back,\" alongside cold face and red heart emojis.",
      "As for Sancho's future, Italian giants Juventus and and Turkish heavyweights Fenerbahce have reportedly shown interest. Negotiations were scheduled to take place last week, with his £300,000-a-week wages a sticking point.",
      "Sancho signed for United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021, as the Red Devils forked out £73m to end a year-long pursuit of the England international. But he's failed to impress under multiple United managers, most notably Erik ten Hag, who was replaced by Amorim after Sancho had joined Chelsea.",

      "He scored 19 goals and added three assists in 32 Serie A games last season as the Florence club secured a European place. They are hopeful of retaining Kean but the Italian has a release clause, but it is only active in the first two weeks of July, reports Corriere dello Sport.",
      "It means United are on the clock if they want to lock in his price. After that Fiorentina would be free to name their own figure, which would complicate negotiations.",
      "Old Trafford bosses have already seen how simple a transfer can be made by a release clause having activated the £62.5m fee that was in Matheus Cunha's Wolves contract. As a result they were able to quickly strike a deal with the Brazilian remaining their only summer recruit.",
      "Conversely Brentford have been able to dig their heels in when it comes to Bryan Mbeumo, who is also on their radar. The Bees have already rejected several bids for the Cameroon forward and United will have to pay more than they did for Cunha if they want to land him.",

He was keen on Liam Delap before he headed to Chelsea.",

At the centre of the dispute is an apparent gentleman's agreement, made between Gyokeres and the club hierarchy, that he would be allowed to leave for less than his official release clause.",

      "Tyrell Malacia is the latest player Manchester United are struggling to shift as their rebuild is hampered by a number of players on their books who they cannot sell.",
      "The Dutch defender was Erik ten Hag's first signing three years ago but he's endured a horror time at Old Trafford and is surplus to requirements under Ruben Amorim. He was loaned out to PSV last year but they do not want to sign him permanently - despite having an £8.5million option to do so.",
      "Malacia is up for sale in Manchester but currently no buyers have been forthcoming for a player who has been unable to showcase his best football, largely down to injuries. After an positive first season he has since only managed three league games due to his horrific luck.",
      "The 25-year-old was ruled out for 18 months after a meniscus tear, a failed surgery, which then led to another surgery as he underwent a lengthy rehabilitation process.",
      "That is unlikely to encourage buyers and United may have to accept a cut-price deal to simply get Malacia off their books, which is likely to be an issue throughout their summer window.",
      "Despite signing Matheus Cunha the club are having to deal with a lengthy list of players whose futures need to be resolved. The majority of them don't appear to have roles to play under Amorim but getting them out of the club is a tough ask, especially for those earning big wages.",
      "The likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony are looking for ways out of Old Trafford - but the Red Devils could end up paying to offload them. Alongside Rashford and Antony, Jadon Sancho was also loaned out last term but the trio are now back in Manchester. They all fell down the pecking order under Amorim and he's offered no indication that he wants to bring them back into the fold.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was left out of the team that started in the Europa League final and has since angered club bosses by wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name on the bank whilst on holiday.",
      "Garnacho, Rashford and Antony have contracts until 2028 - with United now expected to subsidise wages even if they leave the club and are playing for a rival. The club showed they were willing to let their players play for other Premier League clubs with their decisions last year.",

      "Manchester United icon Darren Fletcher is set to take his first steps into management by becoming the club’s under-18s lead coach. The former midfielder has held various roles at Old Trafford since 2020.",
      "Having taken the reins within the club’s youth ranks, he was promoted to the first-team by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Fletcher was named as technical director in 2021 and then returned to his coaching role under Erik ten Hag.",
      "He was then retained by Ruben Amorim as he replaced the Dutchman. But Fletcher has now seen his role changed once more. The Athletic report that he has been offered the role of the lead coach of the under-18s by director of football Jason Wilcox and outgoing director of academy Nick Cox as a replacement for Adam Lawrence.",
      "Fletcher was given the option of staying on as a member of Amorim’s staff but is expected to accept the move and launch his managerial career. Having achieved his UEFA A Licence, Fletcher would lead United’s under-18 side in the FA Youth Cup.",
      "First team star Manuel Ugarte was previously full of praise for Fletcher for helping him understand the demands of being a Man United player. Speaking earlier this season, he said: “We all know what it means to be United, with the history we have.",
      "“The history, the fans, the mystique. I understand this responsibility and that starts with the day-to-day, being 100 per cent focused on the football and ready to win trophies.",
      "“United matches are always on in Uruguay so we all know the history they have. When you come here, and you are with people who are part of the history, for example, [Darren] Fletcher — they transmit what it means to be United.”",
      "Fletcher will follow in the footsteps of a number of former teammates including Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Tom Cleverley in cutting his managerial teeth. Fletcher’s move is the latest reshuffle of the coaching team at Old Trafford. Ruud van Nistelrooy - who has recently been sacked by Leicester - Rene Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel all left following Amorim’s arrival.",
      "The Portuguese has also made a request to United chiefs to bring in Acacio Valentim, his former Braga colleague. Set piece coach Andreas Georgson was initially retained but departed in May of this year, with a number of prominent backroom figures also leaving Old Trafford.",
      "There have also been major alterations in the boardroom. Dan Ashworth departed in December after just five months in the role. United had long pursued him, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe spearheading the move to bring him in from Newcastle.",

      "Manchester United have received fresh boosts in their quest to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer. Ruben Amorim, who managed the Swedish striker at Sporting CP, is still looking to add to his attacking options, having already snapped up Matheus Cunha.",
      "Despite his relationship with Amorim, Arsenal appeared to be ahead of United in the queue to sign Gyokeres, who has scored an incredible 97 goals in 102 games since signing for the Portuguese giants from Coventry City in 2023. However, the Gunners, who are desperate to land a top-class number nine this summer, may feel compelled to focus on another target, which would be excellent news for United.",
      "Benjamin Sesko could be a more realistic target and a cheaper option after RB Leipzig dropped their asking price from £68million-£85m to around £59.7m, according to German outlet Bild. With the Gunners looking elsewhere, United could have an opportunity to swoop and make a statement signing ahead of Amorim’s first full season.",
      "And in a fresh boost for United, Sporting appear to be making plans for life after Gyokeres, who is at odds with the club over his price tag. With their star striker’s future up in the air, the Lisbon side have reportedly set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic as a potential replacement.",
      "Per Germanijak.HR , Sporting have lodged a bid of around £17m, which is short of the Belgian champions’ valuation of £25.6m. Besiktas and Frankfurt , plus clubs in Italy, are also said to be interested in Ivanovic, who netted 20 goals for the Belgian champions last season.",
      "Sporting landing a striker with a strong goalscoring record for less than £30m may also help United in their negotiations for Gyokeres, who is at odds with the Sporting hierarchy over his price tag.",
      "It had been reported that the player believes he has a verbal agreement with the club whereby he can be sold for a fee worth £59m. Sporting president Frederico Varandas has denied that such an arrangement exists but has confirmed that the club did promise the 27-year-old they would not hold out for the full value stated in the release clause, believed to be almost £85m.",
      "And in a fresh boost to United this weekend, Varandas admitted that there is a \"strong likelihood\" Gyokeres will leave the club this summer and for a possible discounted fee. He said: \"Sporting is calm regarding this matter. Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Viktor Gyokeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "\"However, we remain sensitive to Viktor’s dreams or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.",
      "\"Today, there is a strong likelihood that he will leave. I won’t disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for 60+10m. He won’t leave, absolutely not.",
      "\"In recent weeks, we have been paying attention. I saw a player, [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go [potentially to Arsenal] for 65m, and I saw Matheus Cunha move to Manchester United for around 75m euros [£62.5m. We are talking about players who are 26 years old. I believe Viktor could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world, which I don’t believe, as his agent is one of the best in the world.\"",

      "Giles was asked about conversations regarding Mbeumo staying at Brentford and responded: \"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he is going to depart this summer.",

      "It is understood that United, along with Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Barcelona and PSG are all being informed of the current situation surrounding the striker.",
      "While Sporting are attempting to fight for a good deal, it is felt there is a consensus that he will eventually depart.",
      "United are continuing their talks with Brentford over the signing of Bryan Mbeumo after a second bid was rejected.",

      "If things could not have got any more difficult between Gyokeres and Sporting, their president has come out and tried to justify his valuation of the striker by attacking United's business.",
      "Frederico Varandas explained, as quoted by The Mirror:",
      "We have been watching the market and I saw [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, leave for €65million (£55.5m). I saw Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both forwards but who, in my opinion, do not have Viktor's market value or quality, being negotiated for around €75million (£64m). Given the demands we consider fair, I believe Viktor could leave – unless he has the worst agent in the world, which is hard for me to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.",
      "Speaking during the last England camp where Toney was recalled for the first time since his move to Al Ahli, the former Brentford striker insisted that he was never worried about receiving a call-up back to the national team ahead of the World Cup.",

I think it's been proven me being me being back here and being back amongst the boys. It feels good to see the faces again and it feels good to get stuck in.",
      "According to reports in Spain, United are ready to make an offer for former Brentford striker Ivan Toney which would see him return to the Premier League.",
      "The 29-year-old scored 30 goals for Al Ahli this season and this is believed to have caught the eye of United.",
      "It is claimed that United are willing to make a £29.9m offer to bring Toney to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "With Arsenal seemingly switching their focus to Ekitike, United could be able to move in for Gyokeres this summer.",
      "It is widely believed that Gyokeres is looking to go on strike to force a move from Sporting.",

      "Fabrizio Romano understands that Gyokeres has no current plans to return to Sporting at the beginning of pre-season.",
      "Despite already competing with Liverpool and Chelsea for the Eintracht Frankfurt centre-forward, United now have new competition for Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Sport Bild understands that Arsenal have 'suddenly' entered the race for the centre-forward.",
      "It is claimed that Ekitike is a serious option at the Emirates Stadium should they miss out on the signature of either Gyokeres or Sesko this summer.",
      "His asking price could be a dealbreaker for the Gunners though with Eintracht currently insisting on £85m.",
      "On paper, Calvert-Lewin is the type of striker that Amorim will want.",
      "At his best, he is quick, aggressive and can hold the ball up in the offensive third. However, his stats last season make him a huge gamble.",
      "While a lot of his campaign was disrupted due to a hamstring injury, Calvert-Lewin scored just three Premier League goals before his enforced break.",
      "The season before that, he only managed eight goals in all competitions and he has not hit double figures since his impressive 2020/21 Covid hit campaign which saw him bag 16 goals in 33 Premier League games.",
      "He is hardly, at this stage, the prolific goalscorer that Amorim is looking for and at 28, you fear he may not have the years left to reach those previous peaks.",
      "Currently, it appears that Calvert-Lewin could affectively move to any club in this summer transfer window.",
      "Bookmakers bet365 are not committing firmly to any given club with any great strength but United are listed as joint favourites alongside Newcastle at 6/1.",
      "This weekend, Calvert-Lewin confirmed that he would be leaving Everton at the expiry of his contract.",
      "In his statement, the striker refused to acknowledge where he will be moving next but did suggest he was eager for a new challenge.",
      "The choice to move on was not simply about me - it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together. We believe it is the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn’t lessen the bond I’ll always have with Everton."

      "Manchester United are in the midst of a big summer, with Ruben Amorim eager to make his mark on the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "It has undoubtedly been a challenging year for the Red Devils, who struggled throughout their Premier League campaign and suffered the ultimate heartbreak in May’s Europa League final, losing to Tottenham. For Amorim, a degree of rebuilding is essential if United are to gain momentum, and the wheels are already in motion, with Matheus Cunha’s arrival from Wolves confirmed.",
      "Since then, attention has turned firmly towards securing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. The Cameroon international has emerged as a top target for United, but so far, no agreement has been reached with the London club over a deal to bring him to Old Trafford.",
      "Interestingly, Brentford’s sporting director, Phil Giles, has spoken publicly about the negotiations with United, insisting that Mbeumo’s departure is far from guaranteed. His comments reinforce the club’s stance that any deal will depend entirely on the right offer being made.",
      "\"From what I understand, he'd be happy to stay at Brentford next year as well. Let's see what happens. He had an outstanding season and we expected interest in him, and if the deal's right, there's a deal to do.\"",
      "United’s most recent bid, in excess of £60 million, was rejected by Brentford last week, so whether a deal can be completed before players return for pre-season training next week remains to be seen. Yet, the current gap in valuation may force United to consider shelving their interest - at least temporarily.",
      "While Mbeumo has just 12 months left on his contract, Brentford hold an option to trigger a one-year extension, effectively making it two years. If the player is happy to stay at the Gtech Community Stadium, as the club's sporting director suggests, should a move not materialise, Brentford are under little pressure to compromise - especially if they’re not dealing with a player desperate to leave.",
      "From United’s perspective, it’s understandably in their best interests to secure their key targets this summer. Amorim will need all the tools available if he's to revitalise a squad that vastly underperformed last season.",
      "That said, if United are either unwilling or unable to meet Brentford’s valuation, they may be forced to show patience - potentially waiting six, or more likely twelve, months.",
      "Next summer, should Brentford trigger the one-year extension, Mbeumo would enter the final year of his contract. United could then return to the table with increased negotiating power, as the player would no longer command the same fee.",
      "They could well land Mbeumo for a reduced price, but it’s equally valid to argue that the cost of missing out on him this summer may outweigh the financial savings of waiting a year. All United fans can do now is wait and hope that one of the club’s top targets follows Cunha through the door, and plays a key role in reshaping the attack next season."

      "In the first full week of July, Manchester United will return to pre-season ahead of a huge season under Ruben Amorim and before the Premier League campaign kicks-off, plenty needs doing.",
      "United have added to their squad since last season ended with Matheus Cunha through the door. The Brazilian's £62.5million release clause was triggered early in the window to hand Amorim a much-improved option in his attack.",
      "With June about to come to an end and July is guaranteed to be a busy month at United's headquarters. A move for Bryan Mbeumo remains on the cards despite two failed bids, the latest being in excess of £60m.",
      "But it's not just transfers that require attention with a number of issues on the agenda for the club to sort before focus swiftly turns to the start of the 2025/26 season. In terms of transfers, July 1 marks the start of a new financial year meaning United and the rest of the Premier League can enter the transfer market with more wriggle room for manoeuvre.",
      "Alongside Mbeumo, United are expected to target a new centre-forward and possibly a goalkeeper, depending on what happens with Andre Onana. As this is a dream scenario looking at July, United will want Mbeumo and a striker to be part of the group that travels to the United States in a few weeks time.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is still the priority for United with Amorim and the centre-forward having a strong relationship. Talk of alternatives such as Moise Kean and Jonathan David have gone quiet in recent weeks and it all points to a move for the Sporting CP star.",
      "The final dream outcome in July will be getting certain players sold. By the time August 1 comes, the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund will all be out the door. Ideally, the Reds would have managed to sell, at least, two of them to raise funds.",
      "Away from the transfer market, United will spend a large bulk of July out of England. With pre-season training set to begin on July 7, United's first friendly takes place in Sweden on July 19 before they jet-off to the United States.",
      "United are competing in the Premier League Summer Series and will take on West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. The obvious point here, but United will be desperate to avoid any injuries in the USA, something they suffered with Leny Yoro last year.",
      "There's also the key point of getting minutes for every player. Ayden Heaven, Harry Amass, Toby Collyer and Chido Obi will all want to gain valuable time on the pitch with the first-team while the priority for Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo will be to increase their match sharpness.",
      "Contract-wise, some noticeable names enter the final year of their current contracts and that places doubt over their futures. Mainoo is the biggest uncertainty with United yet to tie the midfielder down and Chelsea have been tipped to swoop in, should he be available.",
      "Casemiro, Harry Maguire, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are all close to the expiry of their contracts. All four could easily be allowed to leave next year so United may look to cash-in now before it's too late.",
      "Finally and arguably the biggest thing for United is Amorim having the chance to coach his players. Concerns over their adaptability of the 3-4-2-1 formation used by the Portuguese came up too many times last season and a better understanding will only help United having a better season."

      "Onana is keen to stay at United but links to other goalkeepers continue to persist. Emi Martinez has been linked with a move. So, too, has Porto's Portugal international goalkeeper Diogo Costa.",
      "He has a £64million release clause and, aged 25, still has his best years ahead of him. In a dream scenario, Costa joins, Onana provides competition and Bayindir is sold on. How realistic of a prospect that is remains to be seen.",

      "But he is out of contract at the end of next season and it remains to be seen how United would react if an offer was to come in for him.",
      "Should he leave, then a new midfielder should arrive at the club but given the lack of a definitive transfer link for one at the moment, it may be that United are prioritising other positions in the market.",

      "The Bradford-born striker joined the Red Devils' academy ranks at just six years old and prolifically graduated to a first-team debut under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019. He soon became the club's youngest European goalscorer, aged 17.",
      "In October 2022, the forward was charged with attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and controlling and coersive behaviour. The Crown Prosecution Service later discontinued these proceedings, and all charges were dropped a year later.",
      "After his arrest, Greenwood was suspended by United and sent on loan to Spanish side Getafe. Last July, he departed Old Trafford permanently for Ligue 1 in a deal worth £26.6million.",
      "Just 12 months after his Manchester exit, Greenwood is back in the Manchester area and has been pictured training with what appears to be peers and coaches at Chadderton FC.",
      "The North West Counties Football League Premier Division side are an established non-league outfit in Oldham, and Greenwood took to their brand new 3G pitch in order to complete a training session.",
      "In a series of snaps uploaded to Instagram, Greenwood is pictured participating in sprints and shooting drills alongside former Red Devils team-mate D'Mani Mellor.",
      "The pair graduated through United's academy together and Mellor appeared alongside Greenwood in an infamous 2-1 Europa League defeat against Kazakhstan-based side Astana in 2019. A youthful United side opened the scoring thanks to Jesse Lingard after 10 minutes, but were pegged back after 55 minutes before a Di'Shon Bernard own goal sealed an unexpected away loss.",
      "Mellor, who joined the club's youth setup at the age of eight, experienced a series of loan moves before departing permanently for Wycombe Wanderers in 2022.",
      "The 24-year-old now plays for Macclesfield and was pictured alongside Greenwood earlier this month as the two took part in another training session at a Manchester-based facility.",
      "Greenwood is currently predominately living in France, close to his club Marseille. The 23-year-old scored 21 league goals this season, tying atop the goal-scoring charts with Ballon d'Or contender and Champions League winner Ousmane Dembele.",
      "His Marseille side finished in second place and will therefore grace the Champions League next season, with another ex-United starlet, Angel Gomes, a new recruit.",
      "Greenwood's impact on this campaign was lauded by another of the club's midfielders, Adrien Rabiot, who told The Athletic: \"Mason is an incredible player.",
      "\"If he hadn't had all of his problems, I think he'd have an image like (Jude) Bellingham. Mason would be the star. Because he's an exceptional player.",
      "\"He can score with his right foot and his left foot, he has an exceptional shot, he can dribble. We're very lucky to have him. When he's really focused, he does really great things.\""

      "Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann is a big fan of Amiri, having previously coached him at Hoffenheim, and praised him when recalling him to the national side in March.",
      "\"Nadiem is having an outstanding season,\" Nagelsmann said. \"He’s a very good example of how you can take a step back to push your career forward.\"",

Such a price would be a major consideration for United given Watkins is unlikely to have much resale value.’",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Arsenal\nFrom BILD, Arsenal have joined the race for the France striker, which suits Eintracht Frankfurt just fine. While they’re insisting on £85million, they need the market to look as busy as they can make it appear. And it does Arsenal no harm while they continue to barter with other clubs over other strikers.",
      "",
      "19) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe’re keeping this in the top 20 for now because, based on absolutely nothing whatsoever, we get the sense that something could happen here. Even if it’s just that Liverpool make a move upon which they are told to f*** all the way off. But selling Isak doesn’t have to be the end of the world for Newcastle.",
      "18) Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Liverpool\nThe word is that Liverpool could move for Hato if Palace don’t drop their asking price for Marc Guehi. If they do, they might have to beat Chelsea and Arsenal to it.",

      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle failed with an opening £45m offer for Elanga, with Forest apparently looking for £60million. Newcastle have sought to compromise but they aren’t making many inroads. Elanga might have to force the issue if he wants the move.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites… just.",
      "",
      "14) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal have already had one bid rejected for the Spain Under-21 centre-back but they aren’t done. A second round of talks is scheduled but given the speed at which Arsenal are working this summer, we hold little hope of a swift resolution.",
      "",
      "13) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nEven if Sesko is the man most wanted at Arsenal, the Gunners see an opportunity to get more bang for their buck with Gyokeres. The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "11) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "9) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United.",
      "",
      "7) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "6) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "4) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – and Quansah is now in Germany to get it all done.",
      "",
      "3) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Chelsea\nThis one moved fast over the weekend, when Newcastle and Chelsea both had bids rejected before the Blues went back with something more acceptable to the Seagulls. Apparently, the Brazilian will undergo a medical in the the United States before joining Enzo Maresca’s Club World Cup squad.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London a week ago to complete his move, but Arsenal won’t be rushed this summer. This week, surely…",
      "at long last, the midfielder was in London a week ago to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "There is certainly an argument that Monaco belong here instead, as Paul Pogba would attest.",
      "",
      "19) Bournemouth\nBy making their unspoken role as a transfer stepping stone a part of their actual identity, Bournemouth have established themselves as a destination worth considering for any aspiring player.",
      "A self-described “platform club” who have proven capable of not only coaching and developing to an elite standard but also being willing to sell when the time is right is particularly appealing, not least to agents who might project bigger moves down the line.",
      "And there is an undeniable pull to working with Andoni Iraola, who could deliver European football next season and crucially stay for that part of an exciting journey.",
      "",
      "18) RB Leipzig\nIt is a similar situation at Leipzig, whose very purpose as the finishing school of the Red Bull institution is to polish the gems inherited elsewhere from within their multi-club ownership model and move them on to Europe’s elite for ludicrous profit.",
      "“We are confirming it every single summer in every transfer window, we are the perfect club for young players, to help them for a certain time in their career and then to bring them to absolutely top clubs,” said Leipzig managing director of sport Marcel Schafer last year.",

      "The crisis baton is passed and often shared between Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, whose competence levels have rarely converged over the last decade. Yet they remain far and away the richest clubs in the Premier League with the clearest in-built advantages. Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",

      "This remains a team in transition, with uncertainty over their manager, sporting director and a transfer policy still contingent on player churn and loans with various clauses attached.",

Napoli have won Serie A twice in three seasons but with a managerial ticking time bomb liable to go off any time soon, and the volatile Aurelio De Laurentiis still in a position of power, it would be a risk to join even with their renewed offering of Champions League football.",

But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",

      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, Christian Chivu has a rebuild on his hands and it ultimately tends to come down to money; Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles too.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these constant near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through, as evidenced by this summer splurge.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against has been meticulously erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "3) Didier Drogba\nRoman Abramovich took a year or so after buying Chelsea in 2003 to get his feet under the table before really splurging. Finishing as runners-up to Arsenal’s Invincibles in 2003/04 wasn’t enough for Claudio Ranieri to keep his job so Jose Mourinho was appointed immediately after he’d led Porto to the Champions League.",
      "Following Mourinho – Petr Cech and Ricardo Carvalho too – through the door was Drogba, who joined from Marseille for a club-record fee of £24million. Abramovich flexed his financial muscle by offering OM double what Juventus were prepared to pay. It was money extremely well spent.",
      "Drogba went on to score 164 goals in 381 appearances across two spells with the Blues. The Premier League title in his and Mourinho’s first season was the first of four for the Ivorian, who also won four FA Cups, three League Cups and the Champions League.",

      "2) Alan Shearer\nNewcastle blew up spectacularly in the 1995/96 title race, chucking away a 12-point lead to allow Manchester United to win the title and, subsequently, the Double. But the Toon won the summer transfer battle for the previous season’s top scorer…",
      "Shearer bagged 31 goals for seventh-placed Blackburn who allowed the striker to move on for a British record transfer fee of £15million. United and Newcastle were both willing to cough up so it was a straight choice for the England centre-forward.",
      "“I had to make a decision and at one point, I was 90 per cent certain I was going to go to Manchester United,” he reflected in 2020. “But then I got another call from Kevin Keegan and I thought ‘I’m going to go to Newcastle, it’s a club I’ve supported all my life’.”",
      "Despite all the pots United won in his absence, Shearer was content with making himself a legend in his hometown with 206 goals, making himself Newcastle’s leading scorer of all time.",
      "",
      "1) Thierry Henry\nArsenal reacted to losing the 1998/99 Premier League title race on the final day to a Treble-winning Manchester United by signing two World Cup strikers in two days at the start of August.",
      "On August 2 1999, Davor Suker joined the Gunners. He was followed a day later by a 22-year-old France forward who’d fallen out of favour at Juventus.",
      "Henry’s status at Juve didn’t deter Arsene Wenger from paying a club-record £11million fee, with Henry and Suker joining Kanu, Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars in Arsenal’s front line.",
      "“Thierry Henry is a valuable addition to our squad, he will be a great asset to Arsenal Football Club,” said Wenger, playing it cool when he signed the World Cup winner. Henry went on to earn himself a statue by scoring 228 goals for the Gunners, winning two Premier League titles along the way, even if he had to wait three seasons for his first."

      "",
      "10) Burnley – £46.81m\nThere has been a slew of converted loans and then the first ‘new’ signing has arrived in the form of goalkeeper Max Weiss, perhaps precipitating James Trafford’s move to Newcastle. Quickly followed by the improbably named Quilindschy Hartman.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",

      "",
      "8) Brighton – £51.3m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos, and the 21-year-old Diego Coppola.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

Make those 32 teams the best 32 in the world.  The only way to do this is to put teams from different federations against each other in qualification.  But it feels wrong to just mix all the sides together right from the start.  Marshall Islands would probably withdraw without playing if drawn against England, Turkey, Honduras, Iraq and Gabon.  It’s not worth the cost of the plane tickets.  So, instead, how about two rounds of qualifiers?  Start with matches within each federation, with a certain number of teams from each going through, then have a second round of qualifiers, putting teams from different confederations against each other, competing for the 32 places in the finals.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "The Red Devils have already secured the signing of Matheus Cunha to bolster Ruben Amorim’s attacking options after triggering his £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves and have been pushing to add Mbeumo to their ranks after the Frenchman’s 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "Brentford rejected an opening bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons from United and then knocked back an improved offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons on Friday.",
      "It’s thought the Bees are holding out for £65m for their prized asset, who has reportedly told the club that he wants to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims United ‘remain confident’ and are planning to ‘improve’ on their latest proposal.",
      "Romano said: “Let me repeat once again that Man United remain confident, Man United remain optimistic. They still don’t have an agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, but the conversation is still ongoing.",
      "“Manchester United, according to my sources, are prepared to improve that proposal. It’s not just about numbers. It’s not just about the transfer fee.",
      "“It’s also about the structure of the deal, payment terms, installments, also add-ons, [if they are] easy or difficult, how to activate it.",
      "“Man United are working on all these details of the deal in order to try reach an agreement with Brentford.”",
      "But that’s not the case according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who claim the United board see Brentford’s £65m demand as ‘excessive’, particularly as ‘other areas of the team also pending reinforcement’ and have therefore ‘moved quickly towards a more accessible option’ – namely, Ivan Toney.",
      "The Al Ali striker, who moved to the Saudi Pro League side from Brentford for £40m last summer, has ‘aroused interest’ at United as ‘they believe that his previous experience in the Premier League, his scoring sense and his physical strength make him a very valid bet to lead the attack’.",
      "The report claims that with his Transfermarkt value ‘dropping to £21m’, United have ‘put on the table an offer that could be very attractive of €30m [£26m] plus €5m [£4.3m] in add-ons’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The first contacts have already occurred both between the clubs and with the player’s environment, and from Old Trafford they are optimistic about closing the agreement in the coming days. Toney would welcome his return to the Premier League and even more so to defend the colors of a historic club like United.",
      "‘With this play, the English team not only seeks to avoid an excessive expense, but also to incorporate a striker with experience, hungry to compete again in the elite and with a profile that fits the style of play that they want to implement for the next campaign.’",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is “happy to stay to stay at Brentford” according to the Bees’ director of football as Man Utd ‘make contact’ with Aston Villa over their £60m forward.",

      "While much of the attention has focused on the deals already done, including the signing of Matheus Cunha and ongoing talks with Bryan Mbeumo, the club still wants to strengthen up front following a poor goals return last season.",
      "There’s also rumours that the Red Devils are ready to sign another Juventus star once the PSR deadline passes.",
      "Just 44 Premier League goals from an underperforming side have left Rasmus Hojlund under scrutiny, and recruitment chiefs are actively exploring new options.",
      "One of those is Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, a player United have tracked for some time and who was again linked in the Italian press this week.",
      "Utd are said to be watching the situation closely, with Juventus believed to be open to sales in light of financial pressures and looming accounting deadlines.",
      "Earlier this month, there were reports of direct contact between the two clubs over a potential swap deal involving Jadon Sancho. While the validity of those claims remains unclear, it reflects the reality that Juventus are open to offers, especially ones that could help ease their wage bill or balance sheet.",
      "But Vlahovic, it seems, is not playing ball.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the 25-year-old striker has told those close to him that he has “no intention of moving, whatever the cost.”",
      "The Serbian international is heading into the final year of a lucrative contract that reportedly rises to €12 million for the 2025/26 season, a figure Juventus are keen to reduce, either through a new deal or a sale.",
      "So far, Vlahovic has rejected both options. Gazzetta report that the club offered him an extension on lower wages, but that too has been turned down.",
      "Instead, the striker plans to run down his contract and leave on a free transfer next summer, aiming to secure another sizeable payday elsewhere.",
      "The report paints a tense picture between the club and the player. The relationship is described as irreconcilable, and Juventus now face the very real prospect of seeing their £62 million investment walk away for nothing.",
      "Some believe the club may even consider freezing him out of the squad, referred to as the “Chiesa method,” if a solution cannot be found.",
      "His stance also complicates Juve’s pursuit of Lille striker Jonathan David. The Canadian is available on a free transfer, and a deal is said to be close, but club officials are reluctant to carry both his wages and Vlahovic’s.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are in ‘direct contact’ over a swap deal ‘solution’ with Serie A giants Juventus regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "Nottingham Forest have unexpectedly taken the lead to sign Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, with Arsenal and Man United also linked to the Serbian striker",
      "Arsenal have cleared the path for Man Utd to sign a new striker amid ‘injury concerns’ after the Red Devils’ ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the £67m man.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the camp of a European striker after they ‘approached’ the Red Devils for a transfer.",
      "Arsenal have been given hope that they can finally land long-term striker target Dusan Vlahovic for a very low fee, as Juventus have been unable to agree a new contract ...",
      "Arsenal may have had a breakthrough in their pursuit of a striker this summer as one of their January targets could be available at a cut price."

      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas claims Arsenal and Manchester United only have themselves to blame for missing out on a cut-price deal for Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Both Premier League clubs are chasing the Sweden international this summer and were recently dealt a blow after Varandas dismissed reported claims that Gyokeres had a gentleman’s agreement to leave the club for well below his £85m asking price.",
      "The Gunners are said to have had a bid of around £55m rejected for the 27-year-old while United wait to find out which of Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko will move to the Emirates before feeding on the ‘scraps’.",

      "Manchester United are ‘ready to seal a Rashford agreement’ with a Premier League rival as Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has told him the ‘only’ way a move to Nou Camp will happen this summer.",
      "Rashford enjoyed a loan spell at Aston Villa in the second half of last season to raise his profile ahead of a summer in which he’s doing everything possible to force through his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona.",
      "The England international has been dealt a major blow as the Catalans close in on Nico Williams as their new left winger, and although reports have suggested Flick is still keen on Rashford after sporting director Deco revealed last month that “we like” the Red Devils star, the La Liga giants’ financial struggles are providing a significant roadblock to his transfer.",
      "For their part, United want to seal his permanent exit in order to raise funds for their own rebuild and to get his £300,000-per-week salary off their wage bill, but a report from The Telegraph claims the club bosses now accept that they will now likely need to heavily subsidise loan moves for a number of their players this summer ‘with buying clubs ready to exploit the need to offload players before the start of the Premier League season’.",
      "The report states:",
      "‘[Alejandro] Garnacho, Rashford and Brazil forward Antony have contracts until 2028, which United are now expected to subsidise even if they leave the club and are playing for a rival. Jadon Sancho will also be allowed to leave after loans in the last two campaigns.",
      "United will look to negotiate “salary recovery” from loan deals for their players, although intermediaries believe their ‘bargaining power has been undermined by clearly wanting players off their books.’",
      "That report has led Tottenham News to claim United are ‘ready to seal a Rashford agreement with Tottenham’ as United paying a significant portion of his wages would be the only way Daniel Levy would sanction the move, but Rashford may well wait for Barcelona.",
      "He may well be waiting indefinitely though as a report from Spanish outlet Nacional has claimed Flick ‘has been clear: there is no place for him if there are no departures’.",
      "It’s claimed Ferran Torres and Robert Lewandowski are ‘the two options’ who could leave to open the door for Rashford, but ‘both look complicated’ as neither player wants to leave the club.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘At Barça they value his [Rashford’s] profile, his offensive versatility and his experience, but Flick believes that, with the arrival of Nico [Williams], the attack is already covered, and he does not want to incorporate unnecessary players that complicate the balance of the locker room or the management of the group.",
      "‘The Barça coach has made it clear that he does not want an oversized squad, especially in attack. With Nico Williams, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Lewandowski, the offensive positions are more than covered. That’s why Flick has been categorical: Rashford could only arrive if a weight loss occurs first.’",
      "From Andrey Santos to Evan Ferguson, these returning Premier League loanees could make a real splash in the 2025/26 season – if they’re not sold first.",
      "Newcastle United are casting their net far and wide in the hunt for a new winger, according to reports.",
      "Newcastle have the ‘strongest interest’ in signing the Man Utd star this summer and are making ‘serious moves’ to beat Tottenham and other suitors to his signature.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have made a significant decision on Manchester United star Marcus Rashford as they are ‘keen on a loan deal’.",
      "According to reports, one proposed Manchester United transfer is off as a manager has ‘made the decision’ to ‘block’ his club from completing a deal.",
      "Marcus Rashford may be denied his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona as ‘heavyweights’ at the club are concerned over his dressing room impact."

      "With Christian Eriksen having departed and questions lingering around squad balance, Utd are expected to add at least one new midfielder this window.",

      "“Dortmund are fighting for their player and do not want to sell him under any circumstances.”",
      "Nmecha featured 39 times in all competitions for Dortmund last season, scoring six goals and registering three assists. A regular fixture at Signal Iduna Park, he has become an important part of the setup despite the club’s inconsistent domestic campaign.",
      "Reports earlier in the year had valued Nmecha at closer to €50m, but BILD now claim Dortmund would consider bids in the region of €28m (£24m), offering a potential window of opportunity for clubs like Utd, who are watching the market closely.",
      "Dortmund, however, remain reluctant to let him go. The club’s position, according to Falk, is clear: they do not want to sell under any circumstances.",
      "With no release clause to trigger, any deal would require either a major bid or a change of stance from the Bundesliga side.",
      "According to the report, Nmecha’s familiarity with Manchester, having come through Man City’s academy before moving to Germany, is also seen as a plus. His experience in English football and language fluency could ease any transition, should the move progress.",
      "A subplot to any move would be a potential family reunion of sorts. Nmecha’s brother, Lukas, recently joined Leeds United, and the two clubs are set to face each other in a friendly this July as well as in the Premier League next season.",
      "For now, though, Utd’s interest remains tentative, and Dortmund’s hard stance means any transfer would be far from straightforward.",

      "On the back of a day in which Football365 published entirely contradictory stories on Arsenal’s painstaking choice between Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres, with one ‘ready to sign’ a few hours before a report insisted the other ‘will sign’, we were just about ready to call time on a transfer window which still has 66 days left to run.",
      "We even saw Fabrizio Romano looking ever so slightly exasperated at having to explain that Gyokeres “didn’t say no” to Manchester United but also definitely didn’t say yes as if he was talking Red Devils fans down from a ledge, and he bloody loves this stuff.",
      "He knows as well as we do that it’s these sort of transfer sagas that keep him in multiple mobiles and whatever else he spends his money on, and essentially pays our wages. And this one really is a doozy: two big-name strikers; two Premier League giants; desperation on each and every side.",
      "There are multiple angles to approach it from, opportunities for nuance for those tricksy headline writers and therefore thousands upon thousands of transfer-obsessed eyeballs lapping up every last update, U-turn and plot twist.",
      "We both want it to rumble on so we can garner those sweet, sweet clicks and for it to stop immediately so we can write about something, anything besides. But even if we have to grin and bear it for several more weeks while our advertisers rub their hands with glee, with a goal-orientated mindset we can all take solace in the likely outcome being very, very funny.",
      "The thought of United feeding on Arsenal’s transfer ‘scraps’ is in itself delightful. But far better than that is the very good chance that one of Gyokeres or Sesko will flop while the other shines having either won or lost the race to sign for Arsenal.",
      "Both being held in such high regard means it would be funny no matter which of them flops at which club. Manchester United spending another £60m-odd on a striker to score no goals is funny. Better than that? Gyokeres being that striker having scored them at a rate of one every 84 minutes under the very same manager at Sporting. That would excellent.",
      "MORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Arsenal ‘reach agreement’ for fourth summer signing as £68m Spurs target ‘responds’ to ‘hijack offer’\n👉 Rio Ferdinand snubs Arsenal in PL title prediction for two reasons amid ‘only’ two 25/26 contenders\n👉 Arsenal striker target ‘ready to sign’ with ‘crazy’ obstacle deemed ‘nonsense’ amid two key factors",
      "But not as excellent as Arsenal starting the season with the striker they’ve needed for half a decade before reverting to Kai Havertz come Christmas and then Mikel Merino when it comes to the Champions League punch in March, before we’re all treated to the revisionist pundits insisting they didn’t ever think a striker was the answer anyway.",
      "And that brings us to our ideal scenario. We want Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, after what may or may not have been but have certainly been reported to be several flip flops between the two strikers, to choose Gyokeres as their flop because a) he has very little sell-on value as a 27-year-old, b) their concerns over him scoring goals in a minor league would prove to be amusingly well-founded, and c) (and this is absolutely the main reason) he was Manchester United’s first choice all along.",
      "Even if Sesko somehow weirdly decided there was a different option after being snubbed by Arsenal and didn’t join the transfer market scavengers, we will have been well sated by Gyokeres being utterly terrible for the Gunners given they will have both chosen him and won a battle with United to secure his signature. That’s good stuff.",
      "But of course (and we appreciate that we’re asking too much and probably don’t deserve such joy) the absolute best-case would be for Gyokeres to be absolute balls for Arsenal and Sesko to bang goals for Manchester United as the second-choice striker for the second-choice club. *Chef’s kiss*",

      "The Portuguese coach ‘wanted him out’ in January and was left ‘raging’ when the club bosses failed to find a buyer.",

      "Amorim then performed a U-turn and backed the midfielder to see out his contract at Old Trafford as he wants to retain leaders in his dressing room, and now – having earned a shock recall for Brazil by Carlo Ancelotti earlier this month – Casemiro now wants to stay as he believes he has a better chance of playing in the 2026 World Cup if he remains at United.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
