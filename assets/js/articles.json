      "Jamie Carragher responded with laughing and money bag emojis in a brutal response to Rio Ferdinand following an interview he gave on the upcoming 2026 World Cup draw. The former Manchester United defender is one of the hosts in America for the competition, which will determine the group setup.",
      "FIFA have come under fire ahead of the World Cup due to the cost of tickets for fans, with one recent listing for a ticket to the semi-final on the official resale platform going for £161,000. In the build-up to the draw, Ferdinand was questioned about the ticketing prices and whether the game should be more accessible.",
      "He said to the BBC: \"I am a man of the people in terms of I'm from a place where we were always hoping for things to be accessible. I know that the people behind the scenes at FIFA are aiming and working to something like that now, whether they get there for that remains to be seen.",
      "\"I think we have to be conscious of that and I think FIFA are definitely people who are conscious of that, the powers that be there. I think we can look at every industry, every sector, we have that conversation about things and I think it's more about making sure that there's a product that's super elite that matches what's on the pitch and then everyone can feel that it's justified taking time out and working hard to go and get tickets.\"",
      "Ferdinand came under fire for some of his comments, which included a brutal response from Carragher under the video of the interview. The former Liverpool defender posted some laughing emojis above emojis of some money bags.",
      "The conversation over the ticket prices isn't the only thing to overshadow the draw for the upcoming World Cup in North America. There is also the FIFA Peace Prize, a new award that is expected to be handed to American President Donald Trump during the draw ceremony.",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino is set to commence the draw, while the hosts and draw assistants have now been named. Ferdinand is one of those hosts, joined by Samantha Johnson and Eli Manning.",
      "The draw assistants are made up of some of America's biggest sporting stars, with Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal, Wayne Gretzky and Aaron Judge helping to pick the groups. England are in pot one, with Thomas Tuchel set to guide the Three Lions towards potential glory.",
      "The 2026 World Cup marks 60 years since the England men's team lifted a major trophy, a wait that was almost ended twice under previous boss Gareth Southgate, who reached two European Championship finals. The nation's recent run at the World Cup finals saw them reach the semi-final and the quarter-final.",
      "\"We're getting closer. I think we're getting stronger. The target is to arrive in June with a strong squad, and the emphasis is on the squad and the team spirit,\" Tuchel told BBC Sport on the eve of the draw in Washington DC. \"Then hopefully we get the momentum and the energy around the team right so that, during the tournament, no-one wants to play against us.\"",
      "\"We need to wait until the draw but we have a clear idea against whom we want to play,\" he said when asked about which opponents England could play in March's international break. \"It's a tricky window because it's friendly matches.",
      "\"It's preparation for the World Cup but don't forget, right before the World Cup we have two friendly matches to play. A lot of players will hopefully be involved in the Champions League, FA Cup semi-finals, finals, the Carabao Cup, Europa League, Conference League.",
      "\"It can become a tricky window for us in terms of how to approach it and in terms of who to play against - but the tendency [intention] is that we will play very competitive matches and we will figure out with what group we do this [in order] to learn the most and [gain] the most from it.\"",

      "Jesse Lingard will leave FC Seoul after two years with his contract mutual terminated as the club claim he \"conveyed his desire to move on to the next stage of his football career\".",
      "Lingard stunned many when he chose to move to South Korea as he sought a new club several years ago. He headed to the K League club on a free transfer in February 2024 and has made 66 appearances, scoring 18 goals.",
      "His last game will be on Wednesday against Melbourne City in the AFC Champions League with the former England international finishing on a high after a difficult start, which saw him called out by his manager, before he was later made captain.",
      "Lingard is by far the biggest name to ply his trade in the country and FC Seoul paid a glowing tribute saying he \"generated an extraordinary level of public attention and emerged as a symbolic figure\".",
      "The ex-Manchester United star wrote on Instagram: \"My time in South Korea has been unbelievable - the football, the atmosphere and the passion around this club have been top class. The love, support and the appreciation you have shown towards me for these last two years has been truly amazing. I'll always be grateful for the opportunity to play for such a massive club.\"",
      "He is yet to confirm where he will play next after underwhelming at his last club in England, which was Nottingham Forest. He moved to the City Ground on big wages after their promotion but failed to deliver with his best stint in recent years coming on loan at West Ham.",
      "Lingard became a peripheral figure in Manchester after returning from the Hammers, when he thought he was set for more involvement. He left Old Trafford when his contract expired and has not played for England since 2021, spending months without a club before landing in South Korea.",
      "Lingard has interests outside of football, previously launching a clothing brand, but that has seen him criticised with the former United man enduring a drop off from the player who scored the winning goal in the FA Cup final almost a decade ago.",
      "Roy Keane previously said: \"People say you should have other stuff outside football. I don't think you should. Football should be your number one priority. Focus on the game. Don't hide behind your cars, or your tattoos, or your girlfriends or your agents. Play the game, and you can do all that stuff when you retire.\"",

      "Manchester United wonderkid shared a photo with Sir Alex Ferguson on Thursday, with the pair pictured together at Old Trafford. The teenage sensation spoke of the 'honour' of meeting the legendary manager, who was in attendance for the home draw with West Ham.",
      "Gabriel, who only turned 15 in October, has already been making waves for United's Under-18 side. He has 10 goals in 10 games for the Under-18s this season, including hat-tricks against Derby and Liverpool.",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, his form has sparked transfer speculation, Barcelona have been heavily linked with a move which could see the teenager link up with Marcus Rashford, whose loan from United could well lead to a permanent switch next summer.",
      "So far, though, the efforts of director of football Jason Wilcox have convinced Gabriel to stay put. He is expected to turn down a Barca move - at least for now - and fans have been encouraged by the photo with Ferguson.",
      "\"You stay with us, don't go anywhere. You'll definitely be promoted to the senior team soon,\" one fan commented on Gabriel's Instagram post with the former manager. \"Hopefully the Boss convinced you to stay. Your future's here,\" another wrote.",
      "Gabriel and his camp are also said to have spoken privately with Ruben Amorim. United's head coach has invited the youngster to train with the senior side previously and has publicly sung his praises.",
      "\"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy, and everyone paid attention on social media,\" Amorim said in the autumn. \"You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "\"Not just for me to see for tomorrow, but also for them to feel what it means to be in the first-team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it's important, not just for JJ, but for everyone.\"",
      "Gabriel and Ferguson weren't able to witness a United win on Thursday night. Diogo Dalot put United in front against West Ham after a goalless first half, but Soungoutou Magassa levelled things up for the visitors late on.",
      "\"I think the overall performance was not perfect,\" Amorim told Match of the Day. \"We had our moments but we lost control in the game in some minutes in the first half and in the second half, especially after the goal. The game was clearly ours to win and we had an opportunity with Cunha to finish the game. \"",

      "He is concerned that his lack of starts will wreck his chances of being involved in next summer's World Cup. Italian outfit AS Roma are one of several clubs keen to sign him on-loan.",
      "But the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko has given Zirkzee a rare chance to prove himself. And former England and Liverpool striker Heskey believes Zirkzee can still cut the mustard at Old Trafford, provided he is given the right support.",
      "\"Joshua Zirkzee has not had an easy start to life at Manchester United,\" said Heskey, speaking to betwright.com. \"He's had a really tough time and been scrutinised since he joined the club, but he’s playing with far less fear now - we saw that against Crystal Palace.",
      "\"Hopefully he can use that game as a turning point to really kick on, especially in Benjamin Sesko's absence. From what I've seen, Zirkzee looks like a good investment for the future.",
      "\"But you're not going to get much out of a player if you throw them into the deep end and hope they produce some magic.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka once again came back to haunt his old club this week. And some stars in Ruben Amorim's squad won't be surprised, given their past praise for the full-back's talent.",
      "The 28-year-old was arguably the best player on the pitch as West Ham frustrated United to a 1-1 draw on Thursday. The man affectionately known as 'The Spider' for his tackling range and ability to regain possession did a job in squashing a litany of attacks from his old side back at Old Trafford.",
      "Not only did Wan-Bissaka win 11 duels and make 12 defensive contributions, but he also played a prominent role in attack for the Hammers. And it's not the first time he's frustrated the Red Devils since leaving the club for just £15million last year.",
      "In fact, the DR Congo international boasted a 100 per cent record against United playing for West Ham prior to Thursday's draw. But there are some at the Theatre of Dreams who won't be shocked to have witnessed his impact since moving to east London.",
      "It wasn't long after his £45m move from Crystal Palace in the summer of 2019 that reports emerged of \"frustration\" within the United camp. That was according to United icon Darren Fletcher, who suggested team-mates were flummoxed by their inability to get past the defender.",
      "\"I was talking to some Manchester United players, and they were saying that no player has managed to pass Wan-Bissaka in training this season,\" he told Norway's TV2. \"It's as if he refuses to let them pass.",
      "\"He has to get better technically, but he is a fantastic full-back. When he gets better technically, he's going to take his game to a new level. He is a fantastic defensive player and contributor for Manchester United.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag clearly didn't agree when he sanctioned Wan-Bissaka's cut-price sale to West Ham in 2024. The full-back left United for a third of the fee they acquired him for five years prior and has shone for his new club since then.",
      "As if to highlight the potential misstep even more, Amorim could have done with an additional full-back presence in recent times. Amad Diallo has been converted into a right wing-back this term but can leave a little to be desired in defence.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui has impressed in patches, though injury setbacks have curtailed his momentum this term. The Morocco international is also set to depart for the Africa Cup of Nations this month and will be unavailable for several weeks.",
      "Everything looks better in hindsight, and it's worth remembering Wan-Bissaka displayed dips in form long prior to being sold by United. However, his recent displays against his old side have demonstrated he perhaps had a talent worth nurturing after all.",

      "Last week, Amorim said he considers Mainoo \"a starter\" despite not playing him from the first whistle once in the league this season. The England international did start in the Carabao Cup at Grimsby in August - a tie which ended in defeat.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other players,\" Amorim said last Friday. \"I just have to make a choice and then in the end, it's not been Kobbie.",

      "Now, after Amorim didn’t even bring Mainoo on against West Ham, ex-United midfielder Scholes took to Instagram to vent his frustration at the Reds head coach.",
      "\"Bulls***,\" Scholes posted in response to Amorim's comments. \"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot gave United the lead against West Ham in the 58th minute, but the Reds weren't able to hold on with Soungoutou Magassa levelling for the Hammers late on.",

The United icon was incensed with the result and couldn't get his head around their performance.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side initially took the lead in the second half at Old Trafford courtesy of a strike from Diogo Dalot. However, a late effort from West Ham’s Soungoutou Magassa meant the points were ultimately shared in what can only be viewed as a missed opportunity for the Red Devils.",
      "United have had a favourable run of fixtures in recent weeks, which continues this weekend with a trip to face a struggling Wolves side. However, with just four points from a possible nine, Neville is rueing the team’s failure to capitalise on their rivals’ struggles and climb the league table.",
      "In a rather scathing review of United’s performance against the Hammers, the former defender and pundit criticised the lack of intensity and drive when chasing a goal.",
      "He deemed Fernandes the only player who showed real fight and any impetus to push forward, take risks and search for the all-important winner.",
      "\"This was a massive opportunity,\" he explained on the Gary Neville podcast. “You saw the games they had lined up [against Everton, Palace and West Ham] and they won the most difficult game [vs Palace].",
      "\"But unfortunately, they’re not taking their chances to get up there and be up there. And I don’t get it. I don’t get the lack of urgency and lack of intensity.",
      "\"I don’t get the slow play and the lack of risk in the game. I suspect Amorim isn’t going into the changing room saying 'Guys, play slowly tonight.' He’s going in there and saying to move the ball quickly and to play with real threat and vigour.",
      "\"But it doesn’t transpire out on the pitch. I don’t see the appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game and everything you’ve got. Bruno [Fernandes] does look a little bit like he does that, you could see him at the end there trying to get everywhere.",
      "\"I actually see that little bit of panic in him that we can’t draw this game. I don’t see it in enough of the others. I don’t see. I still see them being quite [passive] letting the game drift or walking to a throw-in.\"",
      "Amorim's side are currently eighth in the Premier League standings following Thursday's result. They are level on points with Liverpool and Brighton and just two off the top four as things stand.",
      "However, had they held on for the victory against the Hammers, they would have moved up to fifth, behind Chelsea only on goal difference. Given how tight the table is from second downwards, every point will be crucial in the race for Champions League football this season.",

      "The Red Devils initially took the lead in the second half through a well-taken finish from Diogo Dalot inside the box. However, they were unable to hold on and secure all three points, as Soungoutou Magassa struck a late equaliser for the Hammers at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim's side remain eighth in the standings, level on 22 points with both Liverpool and Brighton. As things stand, they sit just two points off the top four, but that did little to silence accusations that United have regressed in recent games after such a positive run of form - much to the manager's frustration.",
      "Speaking in his post-match press conference on Thursday, a rather spiky Amorim addressed those claims, while also confirming his plans to debrief the result with his players once the dust has settled.",
      "It emerged last season, after a defeat to Brighton in January, that the United boss damaged a television screen in the dressing room during a furious critique of his players, with a more calm and measured approach having been taken ever since.",
      "\"In that regard, I'm almost always consistent,\" Amorim explained to the media on. \"I had one and you know. Brighton last year. I will talk to them tomorrow.\"",
      "The West Ham draw comes on the back of a mixed week of results, in which United were beaten 1-0 at home by Everton, despite the visitors being reduced to 10 men early in the game. However, they bounced back impressively over the weekend to come from behind and beat Crystal Palace away from home.",
      "While Amorim admits his side are far too inconsistent at present, he refused to be drawn on the notion they are regressing after appearing to turn a corner earlier in the campaign. \"It’s not going backwards,” he added.",
      "\"The results are going backwards. We had some moments. That can happen. You were talking about when we had that run that team was really perfect and saying we are not that far from being in the perfect moment.",

      "Manchester United's chances of signing Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba may have improved, as Brighton are reportedly eyeing a potential replacement for the 21-year-old. Any deal could possibly pave the way for the midfielder's big-money exit.",
      "The Cameroon international was rumoured to be on his way to Old Trafford last summer, seen as a key addition to bolster their midfield. However, United did not make a bid for Baleba, having been quoted a fee in excess of £100million.",
      "Instead, Ruben Amorim and his recruitment department focused their resources on strengthening their forward and goalkeeping departments.",
      "This meant that a revamp of the midfield was put on hold for future transfer windows, with several players being identified as targets for upcoming markets.",
      "Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have been mentioned as possible options, while interest in Baleba continues to be reported as a priority for the coming months despite his patchy form this term.",
      "Whether United will table an offer that could prise him away from Brighton - with his valuation believed to be around £100million - remains to be seen. However, Brighton's activity in the market could increase United's chances of securing the midfielder.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Brighton are interested in Aston Villa's Lamare Bogarde as part of a plan to replace Baleba in the near future. That suggests that Brighton could be open to selling Baleba if their valuation is met.",
      "Bogarde, also 21, is said to be valued at over £25m. He has broken into the first team under Unai Emery, despite stiff competition for places.",
      "Bogarde, nephew of former Chelsea and Barcelona player Winston Bogarde, is now set to carve out his own footballing path. Brighton's potential acquisition of the Villa midfielder could pave the way for Baleba's departure in the near future.",
      "The report suggests that the Seagulls could command a fee north of £100m, given the current market rates for a young defensive midfielder with the ability to disrupt play and control the game.",
      "This development could be timely for United, especially with Casemiro's contract due to expire in 2026 and uncertainty surrounding the futures of Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "He said: \"Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they? But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure. Adam Wharton is a really good player, but can he get around the pitch. Old Trafford is a big pitch, you need to have some physicality.",
      "\"I'd say going off the England form, which has surprised me more than anything, but Elliot Anderson. I really liked him at Newcastle but thought he was more of an attacking player, but he's come into as a No.8 for England and looked very accomplished.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days. I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.\"",

      "The Red Devils squandered their lead and had to settle for a share of the points against the relegation-threatened side. Diogo Dalot's opener was as good as it got for the hosts with their head coach attempting to make changes to press home their advantage and see the game out.",
      "Amorim haad used all five of his substitutions by full-time - Leny Yoro replaced Ayden Heaven at half time, Dalot was brought off for Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount were brought on at the same time to replace Matheus Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee. In injury time Luke Shaw with Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Mainoo has not started a game since the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August and has now been an unused substitute for the fourth time in the Premier League this season.",
      "The United boss was quizzed on whether he would change his subs if he had his time again and replied: \"No, we are losing because of the second balls, sometimes it’s not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offence? Who? Who would be more offensive?\"",
      "Mainoo’s name was suggested, but Amorim laughed and replied: \"Yes, it was the second ball and I was worried with Matheus, I know Bruno [Fernandes] reached the box really well, Mason Mount is playing in his position, they were trying to push us, Bryan [Mbeumo] has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one transition, so that was my idea.\"",
      "There has been talk of Mainoo leaving Manchester despite him enjoying a sensational start to his career. He was a huge hit under Erik ten Hag but his stock has fallen since Amorim arrived into the dugout.",

      "\"You talk a lot of about Kobbie,\" he said. \"I have more players in my squad that want to be in the World Cup, so it's a little bit unfair. I put Kobbie [in on Monday] because he's really good near the box, to have a guy like Bruno and him, they can find spaces near the box and score goals. So that was my idea.

      "Inconsistency has plagued Manchester United's season so far. The Red Devils have suffered damaging results that piled the pressure on Ruben Amorim but also earned victories that signified progress under the Portuguese boss, namely their 2-1 victory at Liverpool.",
      "The month of December is always a hectic one in English football, and it's a period that can make or break a club's season. Given United are only in two competitions this season, with the FA Cup third round commencing next month, the Premier League is of even more importance than usual.",
      "Inconsistency is one word that paints United's season so far. After earning just two wins in their first six league games, the Red Devils then enjoyed a three-match winning streak, including an impressive away win at Liverpool.",
      "But then came a three-match run without a win, including an embarrassing 1-0 home defeat by Everton, who played much of the game with 10 men. Morale then was boosted by their 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace, and it's the topsy-turvy nature of their results that leaves ex-Tottenham Hotspur and Portugal midfielder Pedro Mendes convinced uncertainty exists within the United changing room.",
      "Speaking to BoyleSports, the 46-year-old said: \"Manchester United will get back into the Champions League, but they are difficult to understand. How can you go for three, four wins in a row, playing really well, and then lose at home against Everton? You know, it's just another setback.",
      "\"When you think the confidence is building and everyone is getting up there and knows what it takes, and then they go away and win against Crystal Palace, which was a more difficult game than Everton at home.",
      "\"So that's the uncertainty also that's around the United dressing room that harms their confidence. But I honestly think that United have the quality and the players to finish top five and get in the Champions League for next year.\"",
      "The Red Devils skipper is traditionally an attacking midfielder but has been playing deeper in Amorim's system, with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount all ahead of him.",
      "Fernandes, 30, has been a regular scorer at United since arriving and has 100 goals in 304 games for the club. But, with his role placing him further away from the goal, his numbers have struggled, with just two league goals to his name in 13 games this season.",
      "Mendes believes Fernandes wants to play further forward and has urged Amorim to find a solution so his talisman can get back to doing what he does best. \"When Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, with Morten Hjulmand or Manuel Ugarte before, and Pedro Goncalves was in the middle,\" Mendes explained.",
      "\"So, someone holding and someone just to take the ball and make the team play. I think at Man United, you have Casemiro, you have Ugarte, you need someone different and Bruno can give that to the team. For sure Bruno would love to play more upfront to score more goals but then you have good players upfront.",

      "Ruben Amorim has had plenty of set-piece disasters to analyse with his staff over the time he has been at Old Trafford, but this one was a belter.",
      "It was Soungoutou Magassa who finished calmly to give West Ham United a deserved share of the spoils, but the chance came after Noussair Mazraoui had been forced to make a goal-line clearance because a visiting player had towered above the home defence to power in a header from a corner.",
      "And that player? The colossus that is Jarrod Bowen.",
      "Amorim’s team - and Amorim’s defence - really do keep finding new ways of tossing away winning opportunities. Not that this was an overall performance that merited a victory. It was a performance that was sluggish from the outset.",
      "Young Ayden Heaven set the tone, collecting a yellow card for a woefully mistimed slide towards Bowen and then giving a fiendishly fierce back-pass to Senne Lammens, who duly sliced it out of bounds.",
      "But Heaven’s hesitancy was typical of Manchester United’s early efforts. Their lack of intensity was hard to fathom, and a quarter of the match had elapsed before the home side forced their first corner.",
      "That sparked a brief spell of pressure which featured a Joshua Zirkzee effort being cleared off the line by Aaron Wan-Bissaka, but Nuno Espirito Santo’s team rarely looked in any danger in a first half when the most animated aspect of the home performance was Bruno Fernandes’ ongoing beef with referee Andrew Kitchen, taking charge of a Manchester United match for the first time.",
      "There was no danger of Kitchen being unable to keep up with play - it was strictly pedestrian stuff. And that suited West Ham, who, in Bowen, had the game’s most accomplished player.",
      "But this is a West Ham line-up that looks short of confidence, and there was a sense that Ruben Amorim’s men only had to step up a gear to get some joy out of the night. They ended the first half relatively strongly, which made a laborious opening to the second period even more surprising.",
      "There has been quite a lot of talk this season about the general standard of Premier League football and it is fair to say this was pretty grim evidence that it is most definitely not at a vintage level. It was untidy, it was dotted with clumsy fouls, scarred with some seriously poor passing.",
      "That Manchester United have a very realistic chance of finishing in a top-four position is a bit of an indictment of the overall quality of the competition. They did not deserve to win this contest but Diogo Dalot deserved to score his first Premier League goal at Old Trafford and his first Premier League goal anywhere in 18 months.",
      "His smart turn and finish came just before the hour mark after a miscued Casemiro shot had landed at his feet just inside the penalty area. That should have been the platform for a Manchester United win, but West Ham showed great resolve and no little creativity and carved out a couple of half-chances before Magassa’s composure earned them a valuable point.",
      "There were a smattering of jeers after the full-time whistle but, like Manchester United’s attempts to avoid another disappointing finale to a game, they were strictly half-hearted.",

The Irons fought their way back into the game, and Noussair Mazraoui's goal-line block from Jarrod Bowen's header proved to be in vain as Soungoutou Magassa slotted in the rebound after 83 minutes.",

      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappointing. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"We are talking about fifth here by the way. Same old problems.\"",
      "Keane was frustrated with the lack of intensity present in the squad to go and claim a win. \"United are making substitutions, and he is entitled to do that, but I was watching people come off and it was like they had won the league!\" he added.",
      "\"Show some intensity. It was all a bit, 'this is cool'. You cannot be cool when you're 1-0 up. Get the job done!",
      "\"United have better players than West Ham but this is not a good United team. It was too relaxed, get the job done!\"",
      "United settle into eighth in the Premier League, while West Ham fail to break out of the relegation zone after Leeds' win. A crucial point in their battle, nevertheless.",
      "Pundit Gary Neville was impressed by their goalscorer. \"Magassa has been all action - all around the pitch,\" he said. \"Plenty of tackles. He's been a destroyer out there and he's gone and got a goal. He rescued West Ham a vital point.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United failed to make it back-to-back Premier League wins after a late sucker punch from West Ham at Old Trafford",
      "After beating Crystal Palace last time out, United were aiming to secure consecutive victories and with it move towards the Champions League places. And it looked as though a win was exactly what they were going to get as Diogo Dalot's first Premier League goal in a year-and-a-half opened the scoring.",
      "West Ham were not to be denied though as Soungoutou Magassa scored late on to ensure a share of the spoils.",
      "The draw sees Ruben Amorim's side move up to eighth ahead of next Monday's clash with struggling Wolves. In the meantime, West Ham remain in the relegation zone after just one defeat in their last five games.",
      "Here are all of the talking points from Old Trafford:",
      "After injuries to Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, Ruben Amorim was forced to name a somewhat patched up backline that included Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui in central positions alongside youngster Ayden Heaven. And the former Arsenal man appeared to struggle getting to grips with the game.",
      "He was spun on a few occasions by Callum Wilson and picked up an early yellow card. That forced Amorim into action at half-time with Leny Yoro introduced in place of Heaven.",
      "Man United were well aware of Aaron Wan-Bissaka's defensive abilities when they agreed to let him join the Hammers. And they were on show at Old Trafford to deny the Red Devils' biggest chance of the first half.",
      "Amad skipped past El Hadji Malick Diouf and produced a teasing cross towards Zirkzee. After scoring against Crystal Palace, the Dutchman did well to get his body on the ball and divert it towards goal, only to find Wan-Bissaka on the goalline.",
      "The defender proved to be a stubborn opponent throughout the game. United might have felt he should have been dismissed for two yellow cards but it was still an impressive showing nevertheless.",
      "With Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo back for the Red Devils, some might have thought that their opening goal of the game would come through either of the pair. But it came from a very unlikely source - Diogo Dalot.",
      "After West Ham failed to clear the ball, it fell to the Portuguese defender. He took a moment to compose himself before finishing coolly. It was the 26-year-old's first Premier League goal since May 2024, not that anyone would have known given the cultured nature of his finish.",
      "While it was not the result that the Red Devils will have wanted, there were still a few impressive performances - chief among them coming from Casemiro. It was another brilliant performance from the Brazilian in what has been an impressive season.",
      "The midfielder made three tackles, provided an interception and a clearance apiece and also blocked three shots. Given how close he looked to leaving Old Trafford last season, his turnaround really is impressive.",
      "And if United seal a return to the Champions League, it's not misguided to say that the former Real Madrid star would have been a key part of that.",
      "In honesty, there wasn't too much on quality on show at Old Trafford. Only the goals really stood out.",
      "While Dalot's was a cultured finish, the same could certainly be said of Magassa's equaliser. The ball came towards the 22-year-old after being cleared off the line by Mazraoui.",
      "But he did not panic and converted coolly into the bottom corner. The excitement certainly got to him as he celebrated with gusto, but given it was his first Premier League goal, not many can really begrudge him of that.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt misses Manchester United's clash with West Ham due to a 'small' issue, according to Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils boss believes that the Dutch defender will return in time to face Wolves on Monday night.",
      "Amorim has been forced to call upon teenage defender Ayden Heaven, linked with a loan away in January, for a spot in his backline at Old Trafford on Thursday. Heaven, 19, makes his first league start of 2025/26.",
      "United are already without Harry Maguire due to injury, while Leny Yoro takes a place among the substitutes after a difficult time against Crystal Palace. The Frenchman was comforted following that clash.",
      "The game against Nuno Espirito Santo's side marks the first game that De Ligt has missed all season. The former Juventus and Bayern Munich defender had played every minute of Premier League action and came off the bench in the Carabao Cup tie against Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has admitted it is a difficult loss given the Dutch star's form. The ex-Sporting boss believes it is a good opportunity for Heaven, however.",
      "\"It's hard because, if you see that position, especially this year, it's just Harry [Maguire] and Matta playing those positions,\" Amorim told Premier League Productions.",
      "\"It is a blow. He is playing really really well. But I'm really excited with Ayden [Heaven]. He is working there. I think he has the right characteristics to play there.",
      "\"It is a big opportunity for everyone to see Ayden. For Matta, it is a small thing. I expect to have Matthijs next game [at Molineux].\"",
      "Noussair Mazraoui was also selected alongside Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw, with Amad likely to be playing as a wingback against the Irons. Lisandro Martinez offers an additional defensive presence on the bench.",
      "Amorim spoke about Yoro's place ahead of the game, following his difficulties. It’s really important. I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake and then he struggles,\" he said.",
      "\"He wants to do everything so well. He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",
      "\"He cannot show that to the people the way he came to the bench, he knows that. It shows he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim dismissed claims he had no faith in the Manchester United academy but refused to offer Kobbie Mainoo any guarantees that he would get a chance when the club lose players to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute during United's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday despite being one of only two attacking options on the bench. He has managed just 171 minutes of Premier League football this season and his only start came in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old will return to the scene of one of his best moments in a United shirt on Monday night. Mainoo scored a stunning winning goal at Molineux in February 2024, during a remarkable breakout season that ended with him playing in a European Championship final.",
      "However, he has fallen out of favour under Amorim and doesn't look like forcing his way into the team anytime soon. Manuel Ugarte came on for Joshua Zirkzee against the Hammers and quizzed about Mainoo's prospects before the trip to Wolves, Amorim became frustrated at the topic coming up again.",
      "“Of course I understand [why you ask], and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing,\" he said.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.”",
      "Amorim accepted that Mainoo's situation was becoming deflating for the academy graduate, who could leave on loan during the January transfer window.",
      "But he insisted his team selection was purely down to picking the best players and that he didn't see Mainoo in the best XI this season.",
      "“I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch,\" he said.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "Asked if AFCON could be Mainoo's route into the team, Amorim added: \"I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Amorim's faith in the academy has been questioned recently. He has shunted Mainoo to the margins of the squad and although youngsters such as Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey have made the bench this season, they haven't made it onto the pitch.",
      "It was put to Amorim that he didn't trust the academy, and he went on to explain why Lacey has made the bench for three games in a row but not made an appearance.",
      "\"“But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard,\" he said.",
      "“So you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.”",

      "Manchester United are in the dark over whether Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be available to face Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday, December 15.",
      "FIFA has confirmed that date is when players should be released for duty in AFCON, with the tournament starting on Sunday, December 21, but it is unclear whether that date is for every player, or whether it will move in line for each nation's first game in the tournament.",
      "Mazraoui's Morocco enter the competition in the first game, but Amad's Ivory Coast and Mbeumo's Cameroon don't play their first games in the tournament until Christmas Eve, which leaves open the possibility they could face the Cherries.",
      "FIFA released a statement earlier this week confirming the release date of December 15, but it didn't offer full clarity on whether that date would be moved if a country began their campaign later. The only Premier League game on the day of December 15 is United's clash with Bournemouth.",
      "Asked if he knew when players would be leaving his squad to link up with their countries, Amorim said: \"No, we are dealing with everything. They are going to play the next game and that is the only thing I care.\"",
      "United are in talks with three different national federations to seek clarity on when they expect players to arrive and whether they can retain their AFCON trio for the fixture against Bournemouth. That is the final game of that Premier League weekend, which means the other 18 clubs will be able to field their players who have been called up.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim is confident Matthijs de Ligt and Diogo Dalot will be fit to face Wolves on Monday night. De Ligt missed Thursday's draw with West Ham after picking up a knock and Dalot came off not long after scoring, but both could be in contention at Molineux.",
      "Wolves remain winless after 14 games and have just two points, leaving them rooted to the foot of the table. Their dismal record could make this a banana skin for United and Amorim has warned against complacency.",
      "\"Everything can happen and that will change,\" he said. \"There is no team in the history of the Premier League that didn’t win one game. It can be any game. So we need to try to improve, rest the players, work really well and prepare a tough match because with us it’s always a tough match.\"",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday night. United got back to winning ways in the Premier League against Crystal Palace last weekend but they failed to build on that victory.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "Anger on the touchline",
      "United were on course to claim back-to-back Premier League victories, but they conceded from a corner with just eight minutes remaining.",
      "Carlos Fernandes, United's set-piece coach, stands up on the touchline to oversee every set play, and he angrily reacted to Magassa's goal by storming back to his seat on the bench.",
      "Fernandes looked furious as he returned to his seat. United have majorly improved their threat from attacking set-pieces this season - no team in the league has scored more - but they must improve defensively.",
      "Magassa equalised because he was the most player alert in the box, which will irk Fernandes.",
      "Amorim was happy with Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team last weekend and delivered an improved display at left wing-back after briefly losing his starting role to Patrick Dorgu. Dalot made his 150th appearance in the Premier League at Selhurst Park and followed that milestone by scoring his 10th goal for United.",
      "Casemiro's shot fortuitously made its way to Dalot in the box and he finished well. Once the team celebrations were over, Dalot roared to the Stretford End and pumped his fists.",
      "Amorim made the decision to replace Dalot with Dorgu in the 68th minute, and it was interesting to see Dalot exchange words with his manager as he left the field. The United boss appeared to explain why Dalot had been taken off, and he nodded in approval of his performance.",
      "The gloves came off",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was given the nod to start again after scoring against Crystal Palace last weekend and looked sharp in the first half, linking up intelligently with his teammates around the box.",
      "He had a chance of his own, which was headed wide, but picked up where he left off when play resumed following half-time, combining brilliantly with Bryan Mbeumo to create a chance in front of the Stretford End.",
      "It came to nothing. Zirkzee reacted by removing his gloves, throwing them to the side, which felt like he meant business. Although Zirkzee did not score, his display was pleasing, and he brought gasps from the crowd when he brought the ball down dead with a superb first touch. \"What a touch,\" a fan said near the press box.",
      "The problem is that Zirkzee is not a natural goalscorer, and United might have put the game to bed if he'd scored before he was brought off for Mason Mount in the second half.",
      "Hellish start from Heaven",
      "Ayden Heaven was selected to start his first Premier League game since the final day of last season due to Matthijs de Ligt's absence. The youngster started in the centre of the back three and made a poor start to the game, picking up a yellow card in just the seventh minute for a clumsy tackle.",
      "Callum Wilson has entered the winter of his career but he had the better of Heaven when he picked up the ball. The former England international drove at Heaven at every opportunity.",
      "Heaven almost brought Wilson down in the box with an outstretched leg, which made Amorim react as he sent Leny Yoro to warm up on the byline just 17 minutes into the game.",
      "Yoro warmed up for the rest of the half, which suggested Heaven would be hooked. Then Yoro emerged to warm up during half-time - this time without his jumper - and the change was made by Amorim.",
      "Heaven has been given limited minutes this season and he was, understandably, rusty.",
      "Vivell in the directors' box",
      "Christopher Vivell was spotted in the directors' box. Vivell joined United on a temporary basis last year and was appointed permanently as the director of recruitment in February.",
      "The German slid over in the directors' box, seemingly to look at which scouts and agents were present at the game, and he will be hugely influential again when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Amorim recently confirmed that United could be active in the market, although the club spent £215million (excluding add-ons) in the summer window and funds will be limited in January.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens with Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo. Zirkzee retained his starting role against West Ham, but Mainoo is still yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "Mainoo requested to leave on loan in the final week of the summer window and is expected to do the same next month. Whether such a request is entertained remains to be seen.",

      "If anything sums up Manchester United's inability to plot a smooth course under Ruben Amorim, it is the manner of the goal that denied them a crucial win against West Ham.",
      "A day on from talking up their ability from set-pieces, United were undone by one. The equaliser from an 83rd-minute corner was a reminder that vulnerabilities remain and for all the improvement in the other box, they are still weak in their own. It was a painful blow for a side who looked on course to stick themselves into the Champions League conversation.",
      "There was no anger at the final whistle this time, as there had been against Everton. Instead, it was a resigned silence. None of the players on the pitch slumped to their knees, but they put their hands on their hips and stared at the ground. This wasn't the performance of a team destined for the big time in Europe, but a win had them heading in that direction.",
      "Now they will look on and curse another result that got away, another goal conceded from a corner and another second-half they have failed to win.",
      "This was the one-year anniversary of his first defeat as head coach and they have been regular occurrences since then, 22 all told, including penalty shoot-outs to Fulham and Grimsby.",
      "That this didn't end in another defeat was little consolation for a crestfallen Amorim. There has been the whiff of progress recently, but this team's ability to shoot themselves in the foot - and just about every other part of the body - is crushingly frustrating. To sandwich a win at Crystal Palace with a dismal defeat to 10-man Everton and a draw with a dire West Ham, both at Old Trafford, only reinforces the sense that it is one step forward and one backwards.",
      "United were again slow to get going, showing a lack of intensity in the early stages that is baffling, given their reduced schedule this season. Once again, they allowed a team to get a foothold in a game at Old Trafford.",
      "Ayden Heaven's early woes didn't help. The 19-year-old was starting his first Premier League game of the season and was in the middle of a back three, but his inexperience was preyed on by grizzled veteran Callum Wilson. It didn't take long for Wilson to realise he had the upper hand.",
      "It was Bryan Mbeumo who began to rouse United into life. His short-corner routine with Bruno Fernandes led to a curling shot that forced Alphonse Areola into a fine save. Joshua Zirkzee bundled an effort goalwards that was cleared off the line and Fernandes volleyed a follow-up just off target.",
      "Set-pieces have often been the route to goal this season, but with Matthijs de Ligt joining Harry Maguire and Benjamin Sesko on the sidelines, there was a lack of height against a team who had plenty of it.",
      "That was putting the onus on United to find their ruthless streak as well as their creative streak. They had moments of the latter. Amad's quick feet created Zirkzee's first-half chance and he often looked the most likely to make something happen. Zirkzee's first-time pass into Mbeumo early in the second half deserved a finish.",
      "Instead, Mbeumo was beaten to the ball by Freddie Potts and that seemed to sum up United in front of goal. Zirkzee's link-up play was good, Matheus Cunha was probing, Mbeumo was lively and Amad was direct, but none of them have the killer touch in front of goal.",
      "So it was no surprise that the game was unlocked via a slice of good fortune. Casemiro's long-range shot wasn't going to trouble West Ham, but the deflection spun it into the path of Dalot, unmarked and 10 yards out. He had enough space to take a touch and fire a low finish into the Stretford End net.",
      "United looked to hold what they have and Amorim's defensive subs reflected the nervousness, but having talked up their set-piece ability, they were undone by one instead. Amorim admitted that they still had work to do defensively and West Ham found it too easy to level. Jarrod Bowen's flick-on was brilliantly cleared by Noussair Mazraoui, but Soungoutou Magassa slammed in the rebound.",
      "It was from two corners that Arsenal condemned Amorim to his first defeat a year ago. That another corner proved their Achilles heel against the Hammers summed up a team that just can't kick on.",

      "Manchester United saw the chance to go fifth in the Premier League slip through their fingers as they threw away a lead against West Ham at Old Trafford. Diogo Dalot's goal just before the hour mark looked like landing Ruben Amorim back-to-back wins in the Premier League but momentum was again checked.",
      "West Ham had posed little threat following a bright opening but found an equaliser from a corner when Soungoutou Magassa slammed home after Noussair Mazraoui had cleared off the line.",
      "Here are the United player ratings from Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens: One wayward kick in the first half but was solid aside from that. Didn't have a lot to do but safe hands when Bowen's shot was deflected his way. Nothing he could do to prevent the goal. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Solid on his return to the team. A vital late block and a goalline clearance that deserved more than the rebound going in. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: First Premier League start of the season but he had a half to forget. Callum Wilson played on his lack of experience, he got too tight at times and was booked for a rash tackle on Jarrod Bowen. 4",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended well for the most part and saw plenty of the ball in the second half when United were probing for an opening, but a lack of height at the back was exposed. 6",
      "Amad: Created a chance for Joshua Zirkzee with quick feet and looked like making things happen again. Needs to get the ball high up the pitch to really influence the game. 7",
      "Casemiro: Wasn't great on the ball and didn't bring the composure United needed in their game. Got an assist but more through luck than judgment. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: His range of passing in the first half was good but snatched at two injury-time chances to win the game. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Struggled against Aaron Wan-Bissaka at times in the first half but showed superb composure to take his goal well. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Probably the most likely of the front three to score and forced Alphonse Areola into a good save, but should have done better with a second-half chance. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: Not at his best on his return to the team. The odd nice touch but seemed a little lost in his role and didn't really threaten. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Did well to force Wan-Bissaka into a goalline clearance in the first half and his link-up play was outstanding at times, with one brilliant pass to Mbeumo. 7",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Unconvincing under one early high ball and clearly lacking a bit of confidence at the moment. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: An enterprising run after replacing Dalot and will be pleased with his solid cameo. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Came on to see the game out and failed. 5",
      "Mason Mount: Not much time to make an impression. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Malacia, Mainoo, Lacey",

      "Your December edition of Women’s Football News is on sale now.",
      "The scenes during Euro 2022 will live long in the memory. The nation was gripped with Lioness fever as England made history by beating Germany to lift the trophy at a sold-out Wembley Stadium. But the legacy of that tournament – which saw 16 nations battle it out across a total of 31 games in 10 venues from Wembley to Rotherham – has been huge for the women’s game.",
      "Close to 575,000 fans watched the matches live, many of them attending a women’s football match for the first time, while more than 365 million people tuned in on TV from 195 countries. The sport boomed on social media as fans found their new heroes, while money began pouring into the sport.",
      "In the past three years since that tournament, the game has just continued to grow in terms of awareness, investment, publicity and interest. So the news that the UK is so far the only nation in the running to host the 2035 World Cup is something everyone associated with the sport should be excited and delighted about – and the December edition of the Mirror's Women's Football News is certainly that.",
      "If it is confirmed when the final decision on the hosts is made in April that football is coming home, it will see 48 teams competing in what will be a truly stunning festival of football. A list of 22 venues across all four nations have been put forward by the UK bidding team including the new Old Trafford, Wembley, Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, Glasgow’s Hampden Park, Belfast’s Windsor Park and Newcastle’s St James’ Park. And although that list will be whittled down once the decision on the host nation is confirmed, by the size of the stadiums put forward, organisers are expecting big crowds.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been singled out by Gary Neville as the only Manchester United star that seemed to care about the disappointing 1-1 draw against West Ham. Back at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim's side had a great chance to move up to fifth but failed to capitalise on teams around them dropping points.",
      "An early second-half goal from Diogo Dalot put United ahead but Soungoutou Magassa equalised late on to claim a share of the spoils. Following the clash, Neville went on quite the rant about United's lack of intensity, but he did point out that only Fernandes looked to be trying to score a winner.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"We lost games here and we drew games here. We drew big games and sometimes what would be considered lesser games, but I don't think we drew or lost games in that way.",
      "\"I think we'd throw the kitchen sink at it, you'd see both full-backs flying forward, centre-backs in the box, goalkeeper coming up for corners.",
      "\"You'd see mayhem and there would be a real massive urge to not lose or draw this game and I don't see that, why? You may as well lose. I just don't see the appetite to throw your whole life at the game, [give] everything you've got and take risks.",
      "\"I have to say it does look like Bruno does that. At the end, it seemed like he was trying to get everywhere. I had to see that little bit of panic in him that we can't draw this game. I don't see it in enough of the others.",
      "\"They're walking towards throw-ins and taking things easy, that can't be what it is. I don't know what to say other than they are what they are.",
      "\"What I will say about this league at this moment in time is that the consistency is really dire. Everyone is dropping points, apart from Arsenal. So many teams are not playing at the standards they can achieve.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim, you can see it in his eyes, a frown, he'll be absolutely livid but also gutted that his team can't deliver at the point where he needs them to.\"",
      "After the game, Ruben Amorim spoke on a number of topics and was far from pleased by some questions in his press conference.",
      "When asked if United were going backwards, he said: \"It's not going backwards. The results are going backwards. We had some moments. That can happen.",
      "\"You were talking about when we had that run that team was really perfect and saying we are not that far from being in the perfect moment. We are really inconsistent.",
      "\"But if you look at the goal, 83 minutes, we have a long ball, we have everything under control and we need to do better.\"",
      "United are back in action next Monday as they face Wolves with Amorim's side again playing after all of their rivals.",

      "Real Madrid star and rumoured Manchester United target Federico Valverde has emphasised how happy he is at the Bernabeu, all but shutting down any reports of a potential exit.",
      "The midfielder has been a key player for the La Liga giants since his promotion from the reserve team in 2018. The 27-year-old has amassed just shy of 350 appearances across all competitions and won numerous titles in that time, including the league and Champions League.",
      "His versatility has also required him to operate at right-back at times, especially in recent seasons with the absence of Dani Carvajal and the persistent injury concerns surrounding summer signing Trent Alexander-Arnold. However, there has been plenty of speculation in the Spanish media about head coach Xabi Alonso and a perceived lack of trust and backing from members of the playing squad.",
      "News outlet E-Noticies claimed in recent weeks that United are planning a sizeable bid for the midfielder, and that the player is open to the move after a supposed \"falling out\" with the manager. However, such reports are tentative at best, and a lot would have to happen for the Uruguayan star to leave Madrid.",
      "Valverde himself has now all but shut down any speculation that he is seeking a move away, suggesting there may have been little truth in the rumours to begin with. He still has more than three years remaining on the deal he signed back in 2023, so no move appears imminent or likely.",
      "\"I'm very happy to be part of this team,\" the player himself declared in a recent interview with MARCA. \"It's an honour to have these teammates and to keep improving as a team.",
      "\"Wearing it [the captain's armband] is fantastic. I try to bring out my best, and in recent matches it’s been difficult not to do so.",
      "\"I train to bring out the best in myself. I appreciate the support of my teammates, who always make me smile, and the coaching staff for trusting in me.\"",
      "It is no secret United are in need of midfield reinforcements. The club were heavily linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba in the summer transfer window, but a move never materialised as they instead opted to prioritise other positions, and the Seagulls reportedly could not be moved on their asking price, thought to be in excess of £100million.",
      "Baleba remains a name firmly in the headlines ahead of the upcoming January transfer window, while Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson has also been rumoured as a target for both Manchester clubs. Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton is likewise expected to be a man in demand over the next couple of windows.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

United had the opportunity to climb to fifth in the table against West Ham, and the Reds looked on course to record back-to-back wins in the league.",
      "Diogo Dalot scored at the Stretford End in the 58th minute to break the deadlock, but West Ham salvaged a point thanks to a late goal from midfielder Soungoutou Magassa. Mazraoui was visibly disappointed as he began his post-match interview with MUTV. He was asked, \"Nouss, sometimes football is frustrating, isn't it?\" and responded: \"Yep, it's more than sometimes now.\"",
      "After that blunt response, Mazraoui slammed United's failure to climb up the table due to their inconsistency, saying: \"I think up to the 1-0, we really wanted to win the game and you saw that in everything. We were looking for the goal, a goal came and then we went looking for the second, but it didn't come.",
      "\"Then you see a little drop in energy and that costs you really badly. We know in set-pieces every Premier League team is really strong and if you lose one moment focus, these kind of things happen.",
      "\"It's really frustrating. It's frustrating because we get opportunities to climb the table, that's what we want, to be in a good spot for ourselves, for the club, and we've not been there for a long time now.",
      "\"And we disappoint ourselves, the club and the fans - everyone, basically. We don't make use of these opportunities. They keep coming, but if we don't take them at one point, you're going to struggle a lot.",
      "\"It's hard to find some positives after a draw. It feels like a defeat because you just lost two points here at home for the second time in a row, so it feels really tough.\"",

      "United's late concession from a corner, denying them a crucial win and a jump to fifth place, perfectly summed up the team's frustrating inconsistency and vulnerability from set-pieces. The full-time mood was one of resigned silence among the players, reinforcing a recurring pattern of one step forward and one back under Amorim. Read the full story here>>>",
      "The player ratings saw Dalot, Amad and Joshua Zirkzee receiving the highest marks (7/10) for their efforts, which included a goal, creativity, and outstanding link-up play respectively. Heaven had a difficult first start to the game, earning a low 4/10 rating after being exposed and substituted at half-time. Read the full story here>>>",
      "Amorim defended his controversial second half substitutions, which critics claimed were too defensive and led to West Ham's late equaliser, stating they were made to improve winning second balls. While frustrated and angry at the failure to secure a win, Amorim rejected the notion the team was regressing but admitted their overall inconsistency was a major issue. Read the full story here>>>",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo made a worrying comment by saying that even after conceding to United, he felt his team was still \"in control of the situation,\" which gave him confidence they would equalise. He praised his side's good performance, character, and their ability to secure a deserved point from a set-piece, implying United failed to exert dominance throughout the match.

Up next is a journey to Wolves, who are yet to register a win and languish at the foot of the division - anything short of three points simply won't do.",

United looked set for a frustrating evening as they continued to struggle in front of goal, but Dalot's strike just before the hour mark handed them the lead.",
      "The goal looked set to hand Ruben Amorim back-to-back Premier League wins following Sunday's victory over Crystal Palace, but United switched off and Soungoutou Magassa earned his side a late point. The draw meant United once again missed out on the opportunity to move into what will likely be a Champions League spot.",
      "“Disappointed. We need to control much more of the game, especially at Old Trafford,\" he said. \"We cannot get as anxious as we got after the goal. We were maybe more sloppy with the ball possession, so obviously disappointed with the draw. We had the game there.”",
      "Dalot was asked why he feels United are struggling to find consistency this season, saying: “It’s exactly that solution we have to find. It can be various things. It shouldn’t be like this because we’re fighting 60 minutes to score a goal, when it happens you should keep doing the same things; even more control, longer possession so we can have more dominance, especially when we lose the ball so we are in good positions to recover it back.",
      "\"Especially the goal, the play that goes to the corner we concede, that’s the kind of thing we need to avoid, especially against teams that are good on the counter like we knew they would be today. Unfortunately we couldn’t hold the result but we need to look at ourselves. It’s more our fault than credit to West Ham.",
      "“This type of result just gives you something to look at. We cannot be winning at home with 30 minutes to go and not winning the game.”",
      "On the importance of picking up good results over the hectic festive period, Dalot added: “It’s massive. We are in the time of year when you cannot drop too many points or the distance to the top will be even higher.",
      "\"The distances are short this season but it will get to a time where everybody is going to start spreading and we want to be there in the top four or top five, and that’s the aim. We have to be there. Today we had a good chance and I think that’s why the disappointment is bigger.”",

      "He can do a lot of things better, like other players. When you see a very good game of Diogo he can show he has the quality, but sometimes he drops a little bit.",
      "He’s really powerful, he’s good on set-pieces, he can play both sides. To have that ability of playing both sides that can help you to think about the squad. He’s a very important player for us but he needs to improve like another player.",
      "Try to explain every day how to play, if you're comfortable and don’t have any doubts when you are playing that will help the kids.",
      "Then to work the physicality, the speed of the pressure, the moments to have the ball and pass the ball is completely different to U21s.",
      "He’ll have the chance, I don’t know, but he’s ready to play.",
      "It’s really important. I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake and then he struggles.",
      "He wants to do everything so well. He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",
      "He cannot show that to the people the way he came to the bench, he knows that. It shows he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game.",
      "He has more levels to go. He’s at a different club, different pressure, he was struggling because he was not scoring, he was thinking too much about the numbers but the influence he has in the team is important to us.",
      "Amorim confirms Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire remain out but Matheus Cunha is back.",
      "The United boss also says that two other members of his squad are doubts for the contest but didn't name them and will make a late call on their inclusion for the game against the Hammers.",
      "Read the full story here",
      "The Brazilian has been missing for the past few weeks with injury but has returned to training.",
      "That is a huge boost for United given striker Benjamin Sesko is also sidelined. Amorim will provide a more detailed update on the fitness of his squad shortly.",
      "Cunha hasn't featured since the draw with Spurs ahead of the international break.",
      "The United boss will be speaking just about now to the journalists in the room at Carrington.",

      "So stay tuned!",
      "There is a rare midweek Premier League outing for Manchester United this week as the busy Christmas period nears.",
      "United host West Ham United on Thursday night (8pm kick-off) and they go into the game in good spirits. Despite being 1-0 down at half-time, Ruben Amorim’s side came out as 2-1 winners against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The game against West Ham will now give the team chance to gain momentum and record back-to-back wins. United captain Bruno Fernandes had given United a slight injury scare in the closing stages of the game against Palace, but Amorim has confirmed that he had just been on the end of a kick and should be fine.",
      "The side have also been given another boost ahead of the clash against the Hammers with forward Matheus Cunha providing an update on his injury. Here’s a look at the latest from the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "This week presents a relatively unique experience for Manchester United, who for the first time since the end of August have a midweek game and a short turnaround between fixtures. The embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby further cleared an already quiet schedule for a team not in Europe this year, and United have benefited from the lack of midweek games to drill down into Ruben Amorim's plans on the training pitches at Carrington.",
      "They have played only 14 games this season, compared to the 20 contested by Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle. A gap of just four days between Sunday's win at Crystal Palace and Thursday's Old Trafford date with West Ham is unusual for a team that has become accustomed to the pattern of long lead-ins to games. They have had at least six days to prepare for every match since the start of September.",
      "However, the fixture list is arguably still kind to United, who will play six games in December.",
      "Read more here",
      "There was a nod to his teammates from Luke Shaw at Carrington on Tuesday as he was presented with a commemorative framed shirt to celebrate his 300th appearance for Manchester United, a milestone he might have never expected to reach during his lower moments at Old Trafford.",
      "Shaw's United career has often been one of survival. From spells where he has looked one of the best in the world in his position, to times when injuries have repeatedly struck him down and left him frustrated on the sidelines and a source of criticism from the stands.",
      "The 30-year-old has started every Premier League game this season and has developed into a senior statesman in this squad. He was presented with the shirt by director of football Jason Wilcox and head coach Ruben Amorim, before delivering a speech to the squad and first-team staff. That is something Amorim has introduced this season.",
      "Read more on the changing dressing room dynamic here",
      "Manchester United are confident of keeping hold of JJ Gabriel despite Barcelona stepping up their efforts to sign the academy starlet. The 15-year-old and his family have been guests of Barcelona at the Nou Camp on at least one occasion recently and were given a tour of the facilities as the Catalan club try and woo the United teenager.",
      "Their interest in Gabriel is long-standing. Gabriel has met Barcelona players during his visits to the Spanish city and it has been made clear that the club would like to bring him to their iconic La Masia academy at some point in the future. The England Under-16 international has long been talked about as one of the best talents to emerge from the United academy in recent seasons, but his goalscoring exploits for the Under-18s have seen him enter the wider consciousness this season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Hello and welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will speak to the media at 1.30pm today as he looks ahead of Thursday's Old Trafford clash with West Ham.",
      "We can expect an update on injuries with Matheus Cunha in contention to return to the squad against West Ham and there will also be an update on the availability of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo around the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Keep across this blog throughout the day for updates from Carrington."

      "Manchester United will be looking to make it back-to-back wins and follow up Sunday's 2-1 success at Crystal Palace when West Ham visit Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side ended a three-game winless run by producing a spirited second-half comeback to beat Palace, with goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount cancelling out Jean-Phillipe Mateta's opener.",
      "While Amorim is dealing with an almost fully fit squad, he still has a couple of injury and fitness issues to deal with. Harry Maguire, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha have missed the last two matches, but the United head coach is expected to welcome one of the injured trio back for the game against the Hammers.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim also confirmed in his pre-match press conference that he has two fresh doubts from the win at Palace. However, he refused to name either of the stricken duo.",
      "Despite this, here is a look at the latest from the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "Injury: Knock",
      "Cunha provided an injury boost by revealing on social media that he is back in training ahead of Thursday's game. Taking to his Instagram story, he's shared a picture with a caption reading: \"Back Back Back.\"",
      "Now, Amorim has confirmed that the Brazilian is available again, after missing the last two matches.",
      "What Amorim has said: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good. Matheus is back. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",
      "Potential return date: vs West Ham (H), Thursday, December 4",
      "Injury: Knee",
      "Former RB Leipzig man Sesko was forced off the pitch in the second half against Tottenham before the international break and has missed the last two matches. But, unlike Cunha, Thursday's game at home to West Ham is going to come too soon for the Slovenia international, who is still out.",
      "What Amorim has said: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good. Matheus is back. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",
      "Potential return date: vs Bournemouth (H), Monday, December 15",
      "Injury: Hamstring",
      "England centre-back Maguire suffered the injury during the 2-2 draw with Tottenham before the international break and, like Cunha and Sesko, sat out of the last two matches against Everton and Palace.",
      "What Amorim has said: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good. Matheus is back. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",
      "Potential return date: vs Bournemouth (H), Monday, December 15",

      "That is something Amorim has introduced this season, ensuring achievements are marked in the right manner, and it has become clear in recent weeks that the atmosphere in the dressing room is as strong as it has been for many years.",
      "Carrington insiders talk of how easy every player is to deal with and there has been a collective approach to things like media duties and community appearances this season. It may not be a coincidence that naturally quieter players, such as Shaw and Mason Mount, have found their voice. Shaw has helped Matheus Cunha settle in and has struck up a friendship with the Brazilian, while Mount is now bringing his experience to bear on the squad.",
      "It was noticeable that Sunday's matchwinner wrapped an arm around Leny Yoro at Selhurst Park on Sunday and Mount, having shunned media duties in his first couple of years at the club, has become an excellent talker off the pitch.",
      "The dressing room now feels a more level, meritocratic place. Some notable figures and personalities have left the club in recent years. Players such as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could bring the mood down and dominant personalities like Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo have gone.",
      "Despite the frequent turnover of managers in recent years at United, it is the players who have often faced scrutiny from supporters. That feels like it's changing this season and even if there are questions around the quality of some players, the idea that the dressing room is toxic or plotting behind the back of the manager has gone.",
      "That might be Amorim's biggest success so far. There are signs of progress on the pitch, but off it he has changed the culture and the environment at Carrington, which has been absolutely vital. He has been especially ruthless with players whom he considered to be a bad influence or who affected the mood of the dressing room, axing Rashford, Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho as a result.",
      "The benefits of that approach are now being seen. This feels like a squad on the same page and willing to stick together and that hasn't always been the case for Amorim's predecessors.",

    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "“In the future, I don’t know. Again, I always think the same thing with Casemiro. [He] was not playing and then he plays. I just want to win games. I don’t care who is playing.”",
      "And Man Utd legend Paul Scholes took to Instagram on Thursday night to air his frustration at Amorim’s treatment of Mainoo.",
      "Scholes posted in response to Amorim’s comments: “Bulls***. The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can’t control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave but it’s probably best for him now, enough is enough.”",
      "And now La Repubblica (via AreaNapoli), when outlining Napoli’s winter plans, claim: ‘Help from the market will certainly be needed, but Napoli will almost certainly only be able to operate on loan if the failure to comply with the ratio between revenue and extended labor costs (CLA), which must not exceed 0.8, is confirmed.",
      "‘This is why Kobbie Mainoo, 20, of United, is in pole position for Manna. The English are only considering a temporary transfer, as is the player, seeking playing time so as not to miss out on the World Cup showcase. Napoli hopes to be able to finalise everything within a couple of weeks. But in the meantime, the game is still on, and the Azzurri will do it in an emergency.’",

      "On the reaction of the fans, Neville continued: “When we threw back to the studio and the camera stays in the stadium, and they’re picking up the faces of fans that are still sat in the actual seats, real, real dejection. Real dejection.",

      "“But the way they played against Arsenal, they’ve shown they can play better football, and there are several managers like that within the league.",

      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firmed up again. Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper. But then came another clean sheet against Burnley.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (77.8%).",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. Remarkably, conceding four against Aston Villa was bang on the PSxG for that game.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheet v Bournemouth was more like it.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive. Back to being solid at Palace and it wasn’t his fault v West Ham.",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five.

      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet v Wolves was very, very welcome.",

      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1. He was rather more tested v Brentford.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched. Conceded four goals v Fulham and now looks a little lost.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have lost one in eight. Coincidence?",

      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five v Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",

All this talk about Arsenal being dead certs for the title is wrong.

Monty in the mailbox falls foul of this when he proclaims, “It’s wild that we could win at Leeds and go fourth; a real reflection of how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season”. I put it to the jury, it’s actually a reflection of how incredibly strong the standard of the league is now.",
      "This is reflected in how tricky games have become against any team in the league, with the exception of Wolves (and Liverpool – titter) who have looked poor up until now (cue them taking points off us on Monday) but even they drew with Spurs and Brighton. It’s not just that my team are consistently inconsistent, I look at the fixture list now and can barely come up for air! Any team on their day will give you a game. Just look at how well the promoted teams can hold their own. Even Burnley – are you confident of your team going to Turf Moor and getting 3 points? Because I sure as shit am not!",
      "Oh you want some evidence and not just anecdotal ramblings of a mad man, you bunch of pedants? Look at how well English teams have been doing in Europe recently. Last season all 4 made it out of the group stages in the CL, with Arsenal and Villa going relatively deep. Spurs and Utd reached the final of the EL (can’t remember who won), and Chelsea breezed through the EC and won it. This season, Arsenal are flying in the CL with the other 4 teams in with a strong chance of qualifying; the same for the teams in the lesser comps (although Palace could be doing better to be fair).",
      "So why is this? Well there is obviously the money. Contrary to what slippery Puffy might have opined, mo money does not equal mo problems in football. Mo money in fact equals better players. However, something that has been nagging at me for years is that the main influence on the league is actually the standard of manager (or coaches) and the evolution of tactics.",
      "I’m not sure how to easily prove or disprove this theory, and maybe the better players and better coaches go hand in hand, like the old nature vs nurture conundrum. Or did the better coaches follow the better players or vice versa, like the old chicken and egg conundrum. But the influx of better coaches (typically foreign – they took our jobs Randy!) and ideas has really ramped up the standard of the league, and improved domestic coaching too.",

One approach that I can think of is to look at the average points per game so far this season of the teams that finished in the top 6 last season, and compared them to their average points per game over the whole of last season. Here is what I found:",
      "Liverpool (last season = 2.21 / this season = 1.57)\nArsenal (1.95 / 2.36)\nMan City (1.87 / 2.00)\nChelsea (1.82 / 1.71)\nNewcastle (1.74 / 1.36)\nVilla (1.74 / 1.93)",

      "Out of these 8 teams (who, in recent seasons, regularly competed for Champions’ League spots), Liverpool, Newcastle, and Chelsea are averaging fewer points per game this season. So, this measure, while inconclusive, does not really indicate that the League is weaker this season. What are other measures that people can suggest?\nNick",
      "",
      "…Ah Monty LFC in this morning’s mailbox wins the bitter fan bingo.",
      "‘….this shows how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season’",
      "Translation: my team is playing badly and can’t beat teams I consider weak or midtable so I’ll say it’s a low standard season.",
      "The alternative opposite view is the league is more competitive than it’s ever been. Currently there’s only 3 genuinely weak teams, but if you’re slightly off it against anyone else particularly away from home you’re liable to get turned over no matter who you are and no matter what perch you’ve toppled off.",
      "In Liverpool’s case the alternative view is also that they are incredibly lucky that so many good sides are taking points off each other to enable Liverpool to stay 1 win away from the Champions League places, as they certainly don’t deserve to be that close based on performances this season. Just think where Liverpool would be if they got the results their performances deserved in the first 5 games of the season!\nRich, AFC",

      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places, but they’re not going to finish in the top five of the Premier League if they don’t a) make some signings in January and b) win more than one game in a row.",
      "Will their finances allow a big spending spree in the winter transfer window? Probably not. Are we going to create a scenario where Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos spend around £250million? Yes. Absolutely.",
      "These five transfers would make for a perfect January for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, with a Liverpool hijack, Vinicius Junior and Mason Greenwood all thrown into the equation.",
      "",
      "It’s obvious that Manchester United need and want to sign a new central midfielder. The question is: who?",
      "If this was Career Mode or Football Manager, it would be one or two of Federico Valverde, Sandro Tonali, Declan Rice, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong or Moises Caicedo. But this is the real world. And in the real world, it’s going to be Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton. Which is still absolutely fine, by the way.",
      "Ruben Amorim is never shifting from his beloved 3-4-2-1 formation, so looking at previously successful English clubs operating in the same way, the Red Devils need a player like Nemanja Matic, N’Golo Kante or Jorginho. So it really isn’t all that simple. The best option, that also happens to be realistic, is Anderson.",
      "The Nottingham Forest star’s 2025/26 statistics put him up there as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. He has made 24 key passes (6th), 802 passes (5th), 111 progressive passes (1st), 111 ball recoveries (1st), 35 tackles (9th), 14 interceptions (23rd), won 29 fouls (2nd), and only received two yellow cards. And in Forest’s defeat to Brighton, Anderson became the first player in the last 10 Premier League seasons to record 100+ touches, 10+ ball recoveries, 10+ duels won, 5+ key passes and 5+ successful dribbles.",
      "He might not be Kante, but he could be Matic, and we’re confident he can become better than Jorginho, if he isn’t already.",
      "It would be a statement signing for Manchester United and there isn’t a better option out there among the players who would actually want to join. The fact he can do absolutely everything and has the engine to play midfield on his own makes him perfect for Amorim’s system. The only issue is the price. In January, you’re looking at £100m. In the summer, maybe closer to £80m. Better, but still very pricey. For England’s No.6, though? Probably worth it…",
      "",
      "Not only would Guehi massively improve United and walk straight in as a leader and their best defender, but signing him means Liverpool don’t, which is probably top of the list of positives, next to a blank column of negatives.",
      "There isn’t really much more to say about it. He would be an absolutely outstanding signing, but the odds are heavily stacked against United.",
      "Liverpool put all the groundwork into signing Guehi last summer and were hours away from getting it done, putting them comfortably ahead of the Red Devils in the race. He can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1, which gives Real Madrid a big advantage. They love a free transfer, need a centre-back and have dropped their interest in Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.",
      "But it’s still in United’s hands if they want it to be. Offer Palace £30m and they might struggle to reject it, considering he’s in the final six months of his deal. Just make a sufficient offer well before the deadline, lads.",
      "Liverpool are also in a much worse place than they were when Guehi agreed to join. They were reigning champions – and still are, technically – and looked set to dominate England and Europe after spending over £420m. Now they are mid-table, out of the title picture, and on an abysmal run of form. It’s not the place to be for someone like Guehi, though he could help fix the problem.",
      "And does Guehi even want to leave England? You’d have to ask him. Some players are reluctant to go abroad, especially if a top English club is offering a fat contract and guaranteed minutes. Real Madrid is the exception, though. You don’t turn down Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "It would be audacious to even try, and the noise surrounding Vinicius‘ situation at Real Madrid is probably a ploy to get a better contract. When he realises his only options are Manchester United or Saudi Arabia, he’ll likely return to Florentino Perez with his tail between his legs.",
      "But let’s say he actually does want to leave and refuses to renew. United would actually stand a chance. They are still, in the eyes of many, the biggest club in the world. They are an institution. Players are addicted to the idea of being ‘the one’ who finally fixes them after years of chaos.",
      "Out of all the big names United could chase, Vinicius would be the most ambitious and exciting. Leaving Real Madrid at 25, after being Ballon d’Or runner-up two years earlier, is not a normal career move. Joining United might be career suicide, but if anyone who is remotely gettable can single-handedly fix them, it’s Vinicius.",
      "",
      "Signing Anderson or Wharton, Guehi, and Vinicius is impossible without a significant sale or two. The best sale for everyone is Ugarte. Casemiro could work if the right offer arrives, but he’s actually been pretty good since Ruben Amorim came in. You could argue he’s been the Portuguese coach’s biggest success story so far. Then there’s Kobbie Mainoo, who is a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ pure profit option.",
      "Truth be told, only Saudi Arabia can bail Manchester United out when it comes to Ugarte. No Champions League contender will want him after back-to-back disappointing spells at two giant clubs. Sporting might want to re-sign him, but for nowhere near the £50m United paid Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. That leaves the filthy-rich Saudis, who will surely be interested in a big name like Ugarte, who is still only 24.",
      "It’s unrealistic, but not completely delusional. And United will only sanction his sale if they’ve already signed a new midfielder, or have one lined up.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules will probably still punish United anyway, but they can at least tell supporters they lived and enjoyed the dream while it lasted.",
      "",
      "Another significant windfall could come via the sale of Mason Greenwood from Marseille.",
      "Reports suggested United wanted to reintegrate Greenwood after his charges of attempted rape and assault were dropped, but after putting the feelers out, fan backlash was fierce. They quickly U-turned and pretended they always wanted to sell him. After a year on loan at Getafe, he joined Marseille for £26.7m, which was a low fee, but United’s hands were tied. In an uncharacteristically savvy move, they included a big sell-on clause, believed to be 50%.",
      "Transfermarkt says the 24-year-old is worth around £35m, but 10 goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season, coupled with his potential and previous seasons, suggests he will go for much more – perhaps around £60m, giving United £30m.",
      "And when Greenwood does leave Marseille, Manchester United will finally be able to close a dark chapter.",

      "In a bid to further rattle the old man’s cage, we’ve come up with ten transfers – based mainly on the rumour mill – to encourage what we hope will be some further wonderfully bitter witterings.",
      "",
      "Harry Kane to Chelsea\nA huge long shot for so many reasons, most of which are amusingly listed by the nameless ‘5 elite reporters’ working on the now infamous X account who got one thing right once, were credited by David Ornstein, and are now further buoyed to treat things overheard in a pub or proclaimed by an Uber driver as genuine transfer news.",
      "‘Kane’s age, his hefty wages, and the length of his contract are all hurdles,’ they admit, but insist the Tottenham legend (another ‘hurdle’ they didn’t consider) is Enzo Maresca’s ‘dream target’ who can be ‘the difference-maker in Chelsea’s quest for the Premier League and Champions League titles’.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich\nAfter insisting Bayern only actually paid £11.8m as Jackson and his agent paid the rest, which is definitely actually a very good deal for a striker that would likely cost roughly £1m per goal based on his past goalscoring antics, Hoeness went on to explain why the conditions required to trigger the further £56m to make his loan deal permanent would “never” be met.",
      "“The big money only has to be paid if he starts 40 games. He never does that.”",
      "With just five starts to his name it doesn’t look hugely likely that clause will be met, but a Harry Kane injury or January move could do the trick.",
      "",
      "Michael Olise to Arsenal\nQuite why Arsenal are ‘prepared to submit a record-breaking offer close to €150m (£131m)’ for a guy who’s played 173 games in his career on the right wing when they already have Bukayo Saka and have just signed a very serviceable back-up in Noni Madueke, over signing someone for the left wing, where Olise has played just nine times, isn’t entirely clear.",
      "But we’re not here to question the validity of Fichajes’ claims, we’re here to imagine the steam cascading from Hoeness’ ears when Arsenal sign Bayern’s most valuable player just because they can.",
      "",
      "Lennart Karl to Manchester City\n“It’s like Monopoly: move forward to Schlossallee [the German Mayfair], then some sheikh will come along and then you can buy,” Hoeness said during his rant on Newcastle pinching Woltemade from under their noses.",
      "But there’s more than one sheikh in this multicultural haven (mainly featuring sheikhs and Americans) that we call the Premier League and you, Uli, will soon be forced to admit is The Greatest League In The World.",
      "With Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki you may be asking if City even need Karl, the 17-year-old superstar taking European football by storm, but then you are again missing the point. Need and want are very different things for the clubs able to provide for these players what Bayern aren’t: silly money.",
      "",
      "Aleksandar Pavlovic to Manchester United\n“Uli Hoeness sees Pavlovic as one of the crucial faces of the project for present and future,” Fabrizio Romano said after insisting there’s “absolutely nothing” to the rumours linking the midfielder with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It’s thus absolutely “crucial” in order to push Hoeness over the edge that Manchester United sign him for £60m as the man to fill the midfield doughnut before his inevitable plunge into the pit of despair that’s claimed the last 427 players bought to plug that hole.",
      "",
      "Nico Schlotterbeck to Liverpool\nBayern have a rich, rich history of poaching the best Bundesliga centre-backs. Mats Hummels, Niklas Sule, Dayot Upamecano, Hiroki Ito and Jonathan Tah are the notable recent examples in the last decade.",
      "Schlotterbeck looks to be next on the block, but Liverpool’s need is far greater than theirs, and as proved by their signing of Wirtz, they are a far, far bigger (wealthier) football club.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi to Real Madrid\n“Well at least Liverpool are out of the running for Guehi, clearing the way for us to…. ah f***.”",
      "",
      "Dayot Upamecano to Tottenham\nRemains to be seen whether the first-choice France centre-back, widely regarded as one of the best in Europe who’s out of contract at the end of the season would be as on board as Tottenham in effecting this payback for Bayern’s free transfer acquisition of Eric Dier.",
      "",
      "Mike Maignan to Chelsea\nChelsea’s summer chase of Maignan appears to have lit a fire under Robert Sanchez, turning him into a strangely competent goalkeeper this season, but the Frenchman – seen by the Bayern powers-that-be as an ideal replacement for Manuel Neuer – will be a free agent in the summer and can take over the domestic cup role currently played by Filip Jorgensen and ahead of the dozen or so alternatives currently on the Blues books playing elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Jonathan Burkardt to West Ham\nAn absolute hammer blow to the sanity of Hoeness when the best striker in the Bundesliga not playing for Bayern Munich – ordinarily someone they would sign on a whim just so a rival can’t have them – opts for a Premier League club circling the relegation drain that’s famously the place where strikers go to die.",
      "These 20 Premier League stars have a personal interest in the World Cup draw. But which nations will they be representing next summer?",
      "It’s all going on at Liverpool, with Mo Salah on his way to Saudi Arabia whether he likes or or not. But what would Sir Alex do?",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma looks like a massive boy lost at Manchester City at the moment; he’s no Dean Henderson, that’s for sure.",
      "A key Premier League title clash has snuck up on us all to the extent that it’s on Saturday lunchtime instead of Sunday afternoon like it should be.",
      "A bonus midweek round of Premier League action means a bonus midweek round of Winners and Losers after a tremendously entertaining couple of nights.",
      "We are told Florian Wirtz was ‘brutally’ and ‘cruelly’ denied a first goal, even though his sliced shot was going wide."

      "Manchester United are running out of turning points.",
      "They can’t keep taking one step forward and then two steps back, and that’s the incredibly unsexy dance they performed once again in their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham after beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "That was a huge win, an unexpected win, against a very good team. They had to back that up with another win against a pretty poor one. Alas, they didn’t.",
      "Ruben Amorim should be criticised for his substitutions, which ultimately cost them victory on Thursday night. He even managed to spark debate with his starting XI.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made the bold call to hand young defender Ayden Heaven his first start of the season, with Matthijs de Ligt – the club’s player of the month – out due to a minor injury. Heaven didn’t come in for De Ligt, but for Leny Yoro, whose dropping to the bench was a “tactical” decision.",
      "Heaven needed to settle quickly, and he did the opposite, smashing into Jarrod Bowen with a slide tackle and receiving a yellow card after only eight minutes. Not ideal, but it clearly didn’t rattle him because he didn’t have a poor first half. Still, he evidently wasn’t good enough in Amorim’s eyes as he was substituted at half-time for Yoro, with the booking clearly concerning the Portuguese.",
      "Heaven starting on Thursday reaffirmed what we already knew: Kobbie Mainoo is in Man United exile.",
      "After emerging as one of the club’s best players under Erik ten Hag, becoming an England regular and starting in the final of Euro 2024, Mainoo can’t get a kick anymore, and a January sale is looking more likely with every passing week.",
      "Another appearance on the bench while Heaven was in the starting XI left Mainoo in worrying company with Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia as United’s only first-team players yet to start in the Premier League this season. If you were unsure, that’s their third-choice goalkeeper, a guy who has been injured all season, and someone who was in Amorim’s pre-season bomb squad.",
      "While his standing in the Red Devils’ squad hierarchy is striking, it’s not like he’d have transformed a cautious United performance.",
      "Amorim has said that he’s competing for a starting spot with club captain and best player Bruno Fernandes, and from the minor minutes we’ve seen of them together, it actually makes sense. But for Mainoo, it’s a horrible situation; Fernandes is literally undroppable. His form needs to fall off a cliff to be benched, and he’s only missed nine Premier League games in five full seasons, largely due to suspension.",
      "Casemiro has also been pretty good in midfield for the Red Devils and is Amorim’s biggest success story. He has been criticised for his rashness in the past, but he is more disciplined in that position than Mainoo.",
      "Man United fans are desperate to see Mainoo play more because they love him and he’s an academy graduate with incredible potential, but during a disappointing performance against West Ham, there can’t have been many people watching and thinking the game was crying out for him.",
      "Their performance made for a very dull first half at Old Trafford, highlighted largely by Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s defensive contributions.",
      "The first genuine moment of quality came from Alphonse Areola, who acrobatically tipped Bryan Mbeumo’s cross-cum-shot over the bar, denying United another set-piece goal that would have seen them overtake Arsenal in that statistic in the 2025/26 Premier League season.",
      "In terms of attacking quality, that was really all she wrote in the opening 45 minutes. There was a brief flurry of shots that could have sparked Ruben Amorim’s men into life; Wan-Bissaka cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off the line, Matheus Cunha had an overhead kick blocked, and Bruno Fernandes’ scissor volley clipped the post. It wasn’t the shot in the arm United needed, just three shots.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was player of the half, adding an incredible sliding tackle on Cunha in his own box before producing an expertly read headed clearance from a tantalising Fernandes cross.",
      "It was unfortunately much of the same when the game restarted, but in a match between two teams that can be excruciating to watch that was crying out for a goal, we finally got one just before the hour mark, and in fairness, it did improve proceedings.",
      "Diogo Dalot benefited from a bit of luck when Casemiro’s blocked shot fell straight to him, though he still had plenty to do. His first touch was perfect and the finish was that of an experienced No.9, shifting the ball past Wan-Bissaka and in the opposite direction of Areola’s momentum.",
      "Beating West Ham at home was the only acceptable outcome for United, and going up into the Champions League places would’ve been a welcome bonus. But after taking the lead, they didn’t push for a second, and as the second didn’t come and their opponents found an equaliser, Amorim’s substitutions will rightly be criticised.",
      "Patrick Dorgu on for the goalscorer, Manuel Ugarte for Matheus Cunha, and Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee suggested that Amorim thought it had to be a case of holding onto the one-goal lead rather than pressing on against one of the worst teams in the Premier League this year and putting the game to bed.",
      "Ironically, when Nuno Espírito Santo brought on Andy Irving, his first contribution was to instantly take a corner kick that led to Soungoutou Magassa’s 83rd-minute equaliser.",
      "United might feel aggrieved that Wan-Bissaka wasn’t shown the most blatant of second yellow cards you’ll see all season, but the fact of the matter is that they didn’t do nearly enough to win the game. Areola wasn’t tested enough and any half-chance they did get was rashly wasted, like Fernandes’ left-footed volley in the fifth minute of injury time.",
      "There was a serious lack of quality at Old Trafford. It was just a bad game of football. The United players looked dejected at the end, knowing it was an unacceptable performance and that West Ham at home should have been an easy three points.",
      "Questions will be asked about Amorim’s in-game management again. It cost United and epitomises their season so far: one step forward, two steps back. Just when you think they could get back amongst it, they do something stupid. It’s tiring for us, let alone someone who actually goes to the games.",
      "It’s bottom-club Wolves next. Another team in the relegation zone. No matter how poor they are, United can’t relax and act as if the game is won at 1-0. Or, knowing this team, even at 2-0.",
      "Amorim’s substitutions were so negative that they rubbed off on his players, who seemed to think it was game over and that they could just see it out. Nope. West Ham can still punish you. Even Wolves can still punish you.",
      "United can’t become too casual in these fixtures. They cannot follow an impressive win at Palace with a poor draw at home to West Ham. And we can’t keep looking at games and saying afterwards, ‘Well, Amorim will learn from this.’",
      "It’s clear that this team still has a long way to go. They’ve taken a step forward and a step back so many times they no longer have any idea which way they’re facing.",

      "The Red Devils won three matches in a row in the Premier League in October as Ruben Amorim’s side looked like they’d turned a corner under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "However, one win in their last four matches since has hinted that the same inconsistencies under Amorim remain as they struggle to push themselves towards the top of the league.",
      "Man Utd spent most of their summer budget on three attacking signings with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Only four Premier League clubs scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term but many fans, former players and pundits were shocked that they failed to sign a new midfielder over the summer.",
      "Widespread reports have indicated that a midfielder has become a key objective in the January transfer window with Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher and Wolves’ Joao Gomes seen as more affordable mid-season options.",
      "But now Football Insider insist that a winger is emerging as a key target too and Man Utd have chosen to ‘accelerate’ their interest in Bournemouth star Semenyo.",
      "Concerns over Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for the AFCON for a month could see the Red Devils trigger the £65m release clause in Semenyo’s deal.",
      "Former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown – who is still well-connected at Old Trafford – added: “Losing players to AFCON is a major concern for Amorim.",
      "“Both Mbeumo and Amad are going, and Mazraoui behind them, so its the entire right-hand side going away for at least a month.",
      "“It could have a real big impact on their season if they’re not prepared, and the manager feels the squad is light in those areas, so something will have to be done.",
      "“Semenyo is the one they’ve been looking at, because Ghana didn’t qualify for AFCON.",
      "“It looks like he will be available in January because of that release clause in his contract, that’s why there are a few clubs having a look at him.",
      "“But United need to spend in January to improve the squad, and he’s somebody they wanted to bring in during the summer before he signed that contract.",
      "“If the opportunity comes up when the window opens, it would make a lot of sense because he would also be able to plug that hole left by Mbeumo.”",
      "And reports in Spain claim that Man Utd are ‘prepared to offer over €150m (£131m) to try and lure Vinicius Junior or Fede Valverde away from Real Madrid’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "Valverde is seen by the Red Devils hierarchy as ‘an absolute priority to rebuild the team and return it to the top of the table’ and are ‘prepared to offer a significant portion of their €150m-plus asking price for him’.",
      "Man Utd believe that if Vinicius Junior – who could also cost around €150m – ‘doesn’t sign a contract extension, there’s a window of opportunity to try and sign him’ and reckon ‘a stratospheric offer could open up unexpected negotiations with Los Blancos.’",

      "West Ham have edged recent head-to-head meetings, but their current away form under Nuno is still flat. Four winless trips and a changing midfield make them vulnerable again.",
      "Goals feel more reliable than either side’s form. United’s new-look attack is dangerous, but there are still massive question marks over their defence.",

      "Jarrod Bowen remains their biggest threat on the ball. He’s scored in consecutive meetings with Man Utd and is priced at 7/4 to score or assist.",
      "At the other end, Fernandes is producing again. His deliveries changed the game at Palace, and he has assisted in four of his last six league matches.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo may be scoring the goals, but the Hammers are so vulnerable to set-piece deliveries that Fernandes to score or assist looks obvious at 7/10.",
      "If that price is a bit skinny, you can always pair the two.",
      "Man Utd to win and both teams to score at 7/4 is the standout bet. Amorim’s side have won despite conceding in five of 11. Seven West Ham matches have produced a winner and goals from both teams."

      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for a Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances which now incredibly sees Frank-less Brentford above Frank’s Tottenham.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton, though.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But , well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs went to Newcastle – and got a barely deserved draw – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ and a rare home win over Chelsea does anything more than delay the inevitable.",
      "Gary Neville felt the “real dejection” around Old Trafford on Thursday night as Man Utd were held to a 1-1 draw against West Ham in the Premier League.",

      "“You can leave them out of the side and the rest of the squad can cope. But when you have three or four players who are really talented, but just aren’t at the races, then it drags the team down a level.”",

      "The Red Devils pulled off a major coup to sign 20-year-old Yoro ahead of Real Madrid in 2024, and his overall form over the past 18 months as one of United’s stronger performers has proven that he was worth the hype.",

      "Man Utd have improved a bit this term but there are rumours that Ruben Amorim is demanding a new midfielder in January as he looks to push his seventh-placed Red Devils up the table.",
      "One midfielder they have been heavily linked to is Real Madrid’s Valverde with reports in Spain claiming that he is one of seven names wanting Alonso out at Real Madrid.",
      "The report claims: ‘The dressing room is divided into two factions. Two opposing views. The majority group is the most critical. The sector that no longer trusts Xabi. The one that feels his methods clash with the club’s identity. And here are the seven names leading this stance: Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Valverde, Brahim Diaz, Ferland Mendy, and Eduardo Camavinga. Endrick joins them, also expressing his discomfort.’",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "The same publication also claims that Valverde and England international Bellingham have both been the subject of ‘offers exceeding €100m (£88m)’.",

      "“At that age, you just want to play football, you just want to express yourself. He burst onto the scene and for a while he was always the first name on the team sheet. Now all of a sudden no matter what he does, he’s not on the team sheet. So where do you go from there? For me, he has to look elsewhere. He needs to get football. He needs to get minutes.",
      "“As far as I can tell, he hasn’t done anything wrong. If you look at Man United over the last year, you could arguably say that when he has played, he’s been one of Man United’s best players. So the treatment that he’s getting, I honestly can’t understand it.",
      "“Hence the reason why I’m saying that no matter what he does, he’s not going to start unless something happens and unless Casemiro’s form drops again, or someone gets injured, I think he just will not get a start on merit. Which is the sad thing, because he would be in there otherwise.”",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "Manchester United slipped up at home again as Soungoutou Magassa’s late goal earned West Ham a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.",
      "The three points that would have lifted Ruben Amorim's side up to fifth in the table looked to be theirs when Diogo Dalot finished smartly just before the hour but United failed to see it through with Magassa's neat finish allowing West Ham to claim a point.",
      "United, who lost at home to 10-man Everton in their previous home fixture, do move above Liverpool into eighth but this was a missed opportunity. Nuno Espirito Santo will take the point, his side still among the bottom three but only two points from safety.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Mazraoui (7), Heaven (6), Shaw (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (7), Cunha (6), Mbeumo (6), Zirkzee (6).\n\n\nSubs: Yoro (6), Dorgu (6), Mount (n/a), Ugarte (n/a), Martinez (n/a).\n\n\nWest Ham: Areola (6), Wan-Bissaka (8), Todibo (7), Mavropanos (7), Diouf (7), Potts (7), Magassa (8), Fernandes (6), Soucek (6), Bowen (7), Wilson (6). \n\n\nSubs: Irving (n/a), Kante (n/a), Kilman (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Soungoutou Magassa.",
      "West Ham, who have now picked up eight points from their last five games under Nuno, showed some attacking intent in the first half an hour of the contest, Casemiro having to slide to block Matheus Fernandes' low shot. But United pushed thereafter.",
      "Alphonse Areola tipped over Bryan Mbeumo's cross-shot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line from Joshua Zirkzee and Bruno Fernandes' effort on the follow up shaved the post. United finished the first half with a season-high 25 touches in the opposition box.",
      "Ayden Heaven, making his first start since the debacle against Grimsby, was withdrawn at half-time having picked up an early booking, but the United boss maintained his 3-4-3 structure, of course. And it was his left wing-back of all people who opened the scoring.",
      "Wandering into the box unmarked, the ball fell kindly to Dalot and the Portuguese defender slammed the ball into the net to lift the mood inside Old Trafford. But the fact that they were unable to capitalise on it highlighted why Amorim's team still frustrate.",
      "Andy Irving swung in a corner with his first touch after coming on, Jarrod Bowen won the flick on ahead of Fernandes and though Noussair Mazraoui cleared off the line, Magassa's slotted away the rebound. West Ham even threatened to score a winner.",
      "Since Nuno Espirito Santo’s first game in charge of West Ham, only Aston Villa (9) have won more Premier League points from losing positions than the Hammers (8).",
      "That would have been pushing it but they do not look like a team that will be facing relegation under Nuno in the spring. Where Amorim's United find themselves is less clear. Champions League qualification is a possibility. But not with this sloppiness.",
      "\"The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group players? I've watched the games closely. The lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team.",
      "\"Tonight, you give United praise before the game and they can go fifth. This team is not ready to go fifth. Fifth in the league!",
      "\"They've got Wolves next, they are one of the worst teams I've ever seen in the Premier League. Let's see.",
      "\"I don't get how the players or manager don't sense it. That there could be a twist. They have to do better than that.\"",
      "We had good moments and we lost a little bit of control after the goal.",
      "\"We should have closed the game when we scored the first one.",
      "\"The game was in control, we knew it. Any set pieces can be a problem. We couldn't maintain the ball after the goal.",
      "\"Losing second balls, running with the ball, they were winning the first ball. We can control that kind of game. We should be better with the ball after the first goal.",
      "\"The characteristics with the players inside the box were sometimes not enough.\"",
      "\"It's important because it's a tough place to come. We are proud that we achieved something. It could have been three [points].",
      "\"We are trying to build urgency with results, looking for a better performance.\"",
      "\"I thought all the game, especially second half, we created many problems for Man Utd.\"",

      "United fought back from a goal down to secure an away win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday but continue to be held back by inconsistency under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "They have managed to beat both Liverpool and Chelsea this season but the embarrassment of their defeat to 10-man Everton is still fresh in the memories of fans and Amorim.",
      "The signings of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have added quality to their forward ranks, with Amad also providing some sparkling displays and, although they sit seventh in the Premier League, the gap to Manchester City in second is only four points.",
      "When asked about the level at which United will be competing in two years' time, Amad said: \"Honestly, why not winning the league? Dreaming is possible, no?\"",
      "Mbeumo added: \"If you come to Manchester United, you want to win titles and the Premier League is one of them, so why not?\"",
      "Amorim took charge of his 40th Premier League match against Palace and averages 1.18 points per game, which remains significantly lower than previous boss Erik ten Hag's record of 1.72 points per game.",
      "However, results and performances have improved this term with United taking 21 points from 13 games at a rate of 1.61 per game.",
      "Amad believes the team is moving in the right direction under Amorim, having changed their mindset following last season's record-low 15th-placed Premier League finish.",
      "He said: \"From my personal side, I think we are improving a lot, especially as a team, because I can remember last season some of the games weren't easy for us.",
      "\"We were going into games already thinking we lost the game, but this season is different. Different mindset, different energy.",
      "\"We go to the game and we feel we can win this game, so I think we are improving and the staff also are helping us to make that step.",
      "\"We are not really happy where we are in the table we are right now, but we will improve. What I can say, I'm sure we will do much better for the next game.",
      "\"I think we are a different team now. We know this season is different than last season. We play one game a week, so we have to try to do better every game.",
      "\"The mindset is positive in the dressing room. We are a different team. Bruno [Fernandes] is a leader, [Harry] Maguire, everyone, even Bryan.",
      "\"I think the energy is positive. Honestly, it's much, much better than last season. Like I say, we want to do better every game and I promise we will.\"",
      "Mbeumo, a summer signing from Brentford, has adapted quickly to life at United and is the club's top scorer in the Premier League this season with five goals.",
      "Despite making the transition from west London to Manchester look easy, Mbeumo reveals it's been anything but.",
      "He said: \"First of all, it's not been easy at all.",
      "\"I think I just rely on the hard work, on training, even outside of the pitch, what I'm doing on the side to put every chance for me to do well here. The whole team has helped me a lot to grow as a player here, to find my place and find my place with the team.\"",
      "Amad and Mbeumo have forged a strong understanding on United's right, playing as wing-back and winger respectively and combining to good effect in the final third.",
      "Their chemistry was on show when Amad assisted Mbeumo for the opening goal in the 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield. They combined again for the opener in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham.",
      "\"We have a good relationship,\" said Mbeumo.",
      "\"He helped me when I came, obviously we speak the same language, so it was easier for me to go with him. He was telling me a bit how it was working here as well, so I think we built the relationship from the first day.\"",
      "He added: \"We speak the same language, so it's easier to find the links because we can talk about what happened, even during the game it's easier because sometimes he wants the ball somewhere, so I know and for me it's the same.",
      "\"Even after the game we can discuss about some offensive play that could have been better.\"",
      "The pair will hope to continue building their mutual understanding at home to West Ham on Thursday as Manchester United aim to build on their comeback win over Palace.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek...",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
      "Manchester United have kept just two clean sheets in their last 21 games and there remain big structural issues in defence, with no authority in key areas.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
