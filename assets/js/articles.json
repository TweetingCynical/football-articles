      "Bruno Fernandes appears to have dropped a hint over his Manchester United future after posting a cryptic message on his Instagram story. The Portuguese attacking midfielder is understood to have been set a deadline by Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, who are willing to pay huge cash to bring him to the Middle East ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States.",
      "There have been strong suggestions in the past 24 hours that Fernandes has effectively been given a week to decide his future after Al Hilal tabled an eye-watering proposal worth a reported £200million over three years.",
      "The Saudi club would also be willing to pay a significant fee, potentially worth up to £100m, to prise Fernandes away from Old Trafford even though Ruben Amorim wants to keep him at the club.",
      "Fernandes posted a Portuguese quote on his social media account on Saturday afternoon amid the saga which translates to: “If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.”",
      "The 31-year-old's agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with Al Hilal executives this week and there is now growing optimism that a deal could now be struck.",
      "Fernandes has been away on United's post-season tour of the Far East following the conclusion of their Premier League campaign and he featured in their 3-1 friendly victory over Hong Kong on Friday.",
      "Speaking after the game, Red Devils boss Amorim made it clear that he didn't think his captain had now played his final game for the club.",
      "Amorim said: “I don’t think so. I don’t know for sure, nobody knows, but I don’t think so. I think he’s seeing us taking some actions to change things and that’s all he asks. I think he wants to stay. He is saying no to a lot of things, but that shows he wants to win. He’s really young, he’s really good, he needs to be in the best league in the world.”",
      "Al Hilal are understood to have told Fernandes this is a one-time offer, despite the fact they've courted the player for the past few years.",
      "The Portugal international wants to win trophies but United are expected to be operating with limited finances this summer after losing the Europa League final to Spurs and missing out on Champions League football.",
      "United sources have repeatedly insisted that Fernandes is not for sale but if he pushes to quit Old Trafford, they will reluctantly have to accept the cash which would go a long way towards funding their rebuild."

      "Manchester United are lining up Sporting Lisbon’s attacking midfielder Pedro Gonclaves as a replacement for £100million Saudi target Bruno Fernandes. The Reds were tracking the 26-year-old Portuguese international before Al-Hilal sent shockwaves around Old Trafford by indicating they are prepared to pay a fortune for Fernandes.",
      "But if Fernandes decides to accept a three-year contract worth a staggering £180million then that would give United the finances to meet Sporting’s £70million valuation of Gonclaves.",
      "His arrival would help ease the anger that Ruben Amorim would feel about losing his captain. Fernandes scored 19 goals and provided 20 assists in a struggling team this season, but at 30 he is four years older than Goncalves.",
      "Goncalves plays in a more advanced role than Fernandes after Amorim transformed him into a lethal attacking midfielder who can also play out wide when they were together at Sporting.",
      "The United boss spotted his potential for goals at a pre-season training camp in 2020 - and was rewarded with 23 goals and for assists in 32 games as Sporting won the Portuguese title for the first time in 19 years.",
      "Goncalves has recently returned from injury after rupturing a thigh muscle in Amorim’s final game as Sporting coach in November. He had been attracting the attention of Aston Villa and Bayer Leverkusen before being sidelined.",
      "An added complication for any deal with Sporting for Goncalves is the speculation over the Portuguese club's Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Napoli are ready to battle Arsenal for the £67million-rated goal machine, while Amorim also admires the 26-year-old former Brighton, Swansea and Coventry forward.",
      "Sporting would be reluctant to cash in on two of the players who have just helped them retain the title in the same summer.",
      "Amorim has made it clear he does not want to lose his skipper, but the prospect of using the cash to help finance a rebuild has prompted his Old Trafford bosses to leave the decision up to Fernandes. Al-Hilal have set a Friday deadline for Fernandes to give them an answer.",
      "Sporting will cash in again if Fernandes decides to go to the Saudi Pro League after negotiating a 10 percent cut of any profit United make on the 30-year-old when he left Lisbon for Manchester in a deal initially worth £47million plus add-ons.",
      "That means the Portuguese club would bank over £6million if United seal a deal with Al-Hilal.",

      "And Toffees boss David Moyes remains reluctant, per Mail Online, with defender James Tarkowski still recovering from surgery on his hamstring. A move would potentially leave Everton short of cover in Moyes' backline, though Michael Keane and James O'Brien partnered in the centre of defence against Newcastle on the final day of the season.",
      "It has already been suggested United could be tempted to spend more than £50m on Branthwaite to secure his signature this summer but competition from Chelsea will only add to the difficulty of their question. A January move for the Carlisle-born star is said to have been discussed before the Red Devils opted to operate more frugally with the addition of Ayden Heaven in central defence.",
      "If United go head to head against the Blues in the coming weeks, they may come out on the wrong side of the equation however. Last summer, Branthwaite was unwilling to push for a move that did not include Champions League football.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side missed out on Europe altogether after falling to Tottenham in the Europa League final and finishing 15th in the Premier League following a dismal season. Chelsea's success on the final day of the season against Nottingham Forest ensured they have Europe's top competition to flaunt to potential signings in the coming weeks, handing the a key advantage over United.",

      "Amorim, however, is optimistic that his team can find some benefit in not being in the Champions League next term. A lighter schedule will give the Portuguese coach more time to prepare his team.",
      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform better, to prepare better for games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he said. \"So I think it’s a good thing for us to take advantage not to have European games.\"",

United lost out on the opportunity to do this with McTominay, as they sold him to the Serie A champions permanently.",

      "Gary Lineker has sounded a note of caution to Manchester United regarding their pursuit of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha. United endured a miserable campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "That defeat meant the club missed out on a possible Champions League spot and will not be able to offer European football next season.",
      "Despite the hefty blow that failure will have on the club's transfer budget, United head coach Ruben Amorim is still looking to bolster his squad, with Cunha emerging as a key target.",
      "Reports suggest United are prepared to activate his £62.5million buy-out clause to bring the attacker to Old Trafford. However, Lineker has signalled that Cunha might suffer from \"lacking team principles and work ethic\".",
      "\"He's an incredibly talented player. There's a slight question mark against Matheus Cunha in terms of managers,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"He's either brilliant or he can be accused occasionally of lacking team principles and work ethic.",
      "\"I think a couple of the managers at Wolves have alluded to that. Perhaps, I don't know him personally, but perhaps he can be slightly problematic.\"",
      "The 26-year-old was handed a two-game ban in December after appearing to elbow an Ipswich Town staff member before removing the same person’s glasses. In March, he was also suspended for four games after headbutting Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez and being escorted down the tunnel during an FA Cup clash.",
      "However, Micah Richards thinks a move to United could be just what Cunha needs to put past troubles behind him. The ex-Manchester City centre-back believes that a change of scenery to a bigger club could help Cunha thrive.",
      "\"I think that 's more out of frustration,\" Richards said in response to Lineker's comments. \"I think if you're playing with–where Man United finished this season, you can't even say a better team–but ultimately a bigger club and better players, ego is put to the side a little bit.",
      "\"I think he's perfect for that system with two number 10s. He loves drifting to one side, getting on the ball, really creative and he can see a pass, so I think he'll be a good signing for Man United if they can get him.\"",
      "With Amorim downplaying the need for extensive squad renovations, it's yet unclear who else will join Cunha at the Red Devils, should he make the move.",
      "\"Without Champions League, we don't need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way,\" Amorim said during United's post-season tour. \"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules.",
      "\"We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that. It's important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.\""

The former defender came through the Red Devils academy during the reign of Sir Alex Ferguson, and while he never established himself in the first team, he did make a handful of appearances for his boyhood club.",
      "Starting against Arsenal in the League Cup was certainly a highlight for Bolton-born Roche, whose shining light in his short United career came when he started against Deportivo La Coruna in the Champions League in March 2003.",
      "Given United had already secured their passage into the knockout stages, Roche was one of many youngsters that Ferguson opted to start in Spain alongside senior stars such as Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Laurent Blanc.",
      "He lasted 45 minutes and was subbed off at half time with United 1-0 down, before they conceded another after the break to lose 2-0 in their final game of the second group stage.",
      "Despite his presence on the European stage, it wasn't long before Roche fell down the footballing pyramid. He had stints with Burnley, Wrexham and Droylsden after being released on a free transfer by United in the summer of 2003, before retiring from the sport at 27 years of age.",
      "Now working on a building site in his post-football career, the 44-year-old admitted he didn't expect his sporting career to end the way it did, especially given the success United possess in their academy graduates.",
      "Asked if he ever expected to have such a drastic career change, he told LFETV back in 2012: \"Definitely not. Especially when you sign for a club as big as Manchester United. You think you're going to be playing football until you're 35.",
      "\"The way things have turned out I've had to work, I've been working here for nearly three years and it's a bit of a change from playing football, but you just have to get on with it.\"",
      "After parting ways with football, Roche was supported by the PFA and has since become a qualified plumber and owns a cavity wall insulation business.",
      "Having had to discover what his next step in life would be after football, Roche said he believes young players should have a back-up plan if their careers don't blossom as they'd expect.",
      "\"I have had a few fellow workers on the building sites asking me about United and how have I ended up here,\" he said.",
      "\"It can get pretty tiresome so I don’t go shouting about that I played for United. I do think young players today should be made to train as something, so they know about the real world. Most of them probably don’t have a plan to fall back on if they don’t make it as a professional.\""

      "Since coach Ruben Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, the hunt for competent wing-backs to suit his system has been lingering. The likes of Diogo Dalot, Luke Shaw, and Noussair Mazraoui simply haven't cut it, and Patrick Dorgu, who was recruited in January, has failed to make a splash.",
      "Back in the summer of 2024, it was reported that Dutch defender Dumfries would refuse to pen a new deal with Inter until after the window had closed, and even when it did, no negotiations were entered. This put United on high alert, as, according to The Athletic, Dumfries was focused on moving elsewhere, and the Red Devils appealed the most.",
      "With Amorim joining and placing a further emphasis on wide play, the prospect of a player of Dumfries' calibre being poached this summer, with his contract winding down, would have been joyous for United, though these hopes have now been dashed.",
      "The 29-year-old, who has played a pivotal role in guiding last year's Scudetto winners to the Champions League final, where they'll face Paris Saint-Germain, has reversed his wish to depart and signed a new deal in Italy until 2028.",
      "Amorim's side are now left in an all-too-familiar predicament, with the right-sided wing-back position one they are in dire need of improving. One player who was linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer was Dumfries' fellow countryman, Bundesliga star Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "The pacey 24-year-old was a key part of Bayer Leverkusen's brilliant unbeaten league campaign last year, and with his contract nearing its end, suitors were queuing up.",
      "Yet, though his expertise up and down the right-hand side would have suited Amorim's United to a tee, and they were reportedly actively pursuing a deal for the player, according to German outlet BILD, rivals Liverpool will imminently secure his services for roughly £30million.",
      "With both Dumfries and Frimpong lost out on, attention will likely turn elsewhere, with a gaping hole still occupying this area of the pitch.",
      "Amorim has made it clear in the past exactly what he wants from his right-sided star, stating after a home win against Everton last December: \"What I want is a good one-against-one, to open the field, to play, to close the field when we lose the ball, and it is the same in every team.\"",
      "Stephen Warnock, a full-back who starred for Liverpool and Aston Villa, among others, detailed exactly what traits a competent wing-back will need to thrive in the Premier Legaue, telling The Athletic: \"You've got to be able to get up and down the pitch.",
      "\"You also need replacements to come on and be able to play in those areas,\" he continued, suggesting that just one signing within these areas may not be enough for United.",
      "\"If you are going to be up and down in that position, then you've got to be able to run yourself into the ground for, say, 70 to 80 minutes, and then maybe at the end of the game, you need someone to come on and just fill in that gap.\"",

      "They were forced to settle for second place in the Premier League for the third year in a row, and a Champions League run ended in disappointment at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the semis. One notable statistic that arose from a season filled with injury was that, for the first time in 1924, no Arsenal player reached the 10 league goals tally.",
      "Amid reports linking Sesko to the Premier League 12 months ago, it was revealed that, out of Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United, he would rather end up with the Gunners. This revelation was followed in January by the claim that a £60million gentleman's agreement had been reached between the player and his German employers, meaning he would be able to leave this summer for that amount.",
      "A substantial January offer was rumoured to have been enough for Leipzig to part ways with Sesko then, and while Barcelona's eye was caught alongside the interested Gunners, such an offer never arrived.",
      "Fast-forward to the here and now and new reports suggest that £60m would not be enough for suitors Arsenal to secure Sesko's services. Instead, the Telegraph now reports that a price tag of £92m has been slapped on the marksman.",
      "Sesko mustered 21 goals in 45 matches for Leipzig during the campaign gone by, though with his club missing out on European football, it is likely that finances will need to be raised.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly been discussing internally whether to push ahead and attempt to strike a deal with Leipzig, with Chelsea also interested, or aim efforts at signing Sporting CP star Viktor Gyokeres. When asked in April about what may happen this summer, Sesko replied: \"We'll see what happens. It's open, anything can happen.\"",
      "Arteta, too, has stayed coy on Arsenal's plans for this upcoming window, but did hint that while an initial budget and plan have been put in place, the option to break the bank under sporting director Andrea Berta is there.",
      "\"The thing is that the budget is like when you have your wedding, you plan your wedding with your wife and you give her a budget and never less, it's always more,\" admitted Arteta.",
      "\"When you build a house, it's always more. Normally, this happens. You prepare for different scenarios. Then, unfortunate things happen. Sometimes we want a player, and suddenly we have an injury, or that player gets injured.",
      "\"There are so many variables that can happen, but there is a budget. There is always an idea of what we can do, what we can improve, what the priorities are going to be, and then let's see if we can do it.\"",
      "It remains to be seen where Arsenal's attacking attention will primarily turn, but with the window briefly opening from Sunday until June 10 due to the Club World Cup, Berta and Co may be wise to move quick and finally resolve Arteta's glaring issue once and for all.",

      "A talented young defender, the Italian has made a name for himself with Hellas Verona in Serie A. As it stands, the Seagulls are the favourites but could face competition from Juventus and Aston Villa.",
      "Burnley - Daniel Peretz (Bayern Munich)",
      "This very much depends on what happens with James Trafford. But reports in Germany have claimed that the Clarets are keen on sealing Peretz on a loan deal. Bayern would reportedly be willing to loan him out so a deal could be relatively easy.",
      "Chelsea - Liam Delap (Ipswich)",
      "A relatively straightforward one, Chelsea have already activated the £30m release clause written into Delap’s Ipswich contract. It won't be two days, as his medical is happening on Monday, but it should be smooth sailing from there.",
      "Crystal Palace - Reinildo Mandava (Atletico Madrid)",
      "After winning the FA Cup, Palace are understandably keen to bolster their squad. Atletico Madrid left-back Reinildo has reportedly been identified as a replacement for Ben Chilwell, who will return to Chelsea at the end of his loan spell.",
      "Everton - Charly Alcaraz (Flamengo)",
      "Much like Rashford, Charly Alcaraz could see his loan move to Everton turned into a permanent one very shortly. The former Southampton man is now in talks over personal terms and is fully expected to become a full-time Toffee.",
      "Fulham - Ardon Jashari (Club Brugge)",
      "This one might actually be a bit more difficult than some of the other names on the list. The Club Brugge midfielder has shone over in Belgium, garnering interest from the Premier League. Fulham could steal a march with an early move.",
      "Leeds United - Manor Solomon (Tottenham)",
      "One of the heroes of Leeds' promotion, there have been calls for the club to push through a permanent deal. And it appears that it could actually happen, with Spurs open to selling. Leeds might face competition from Everton so they might need to get their skates on.",
      "Liverpool - Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen)",
      "Jeremie Frimpong is done and his Bayer Leverkusen team-mate may not be far behind. Liverpool have made a second offer to the Germans worth a cool £109m and with Wirtz heading on international duty shortly, his desire to move to Anfield and Leverkusen's delight it's not Bayern, this could move very, very quickly.",
      "Manchester City - Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan)",
      "The champions certainly need some signings to reclaim their crown. And it appears to be in midfield where Pep Guardiola is keen to add some new faces. AC Milan have already rejected City’s opening offer for Reijnders but don’t be surprised if they try again.",
      "Manchester United - Matheus Cunha (Wolves)",
      "Another release clause, another imminent move. Matheus Cunha appears set to become a Red Devil after his £62m release clause was activated. The Brazilian is also set for a medical over the coming days.",
      "Newcastle - Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)",
      "Newcastle are long-term admirers of Guehi and have seen a number of bids rebuffed in the past. But with some financial muscle behind them courtesy of their Champions League qualification, this summer might finally be the window where they get him.",
      "Nottingham Forest - Igor Jesus (Botafogo)",
      "Speaking of European football, Nottingham Forest could do with some depth ahead of their return to continental competition - particularly up front. Botafogo striker Igor Jesus has reportedly emerged as a target with the two clubs seemingly not far away from a deal.",
      "Sunderland - Jordan Henderson (Ajax)",
      "There's been rumours of an emotional return this summer and it could finally be the perfect time for it to happen. Henderson has really struggled to settle since leaving Liverpool and his boyhood club might be the perfect place to do that.",
      "Tottenham - Mathys Tel (Bayern Munich)",
      "Having scored just three times for Spurs since his arrival on loan from Bayern Munich, there is a debate to be had over whether they should activate their option to sign Tel permanently. A deal would be costly at the £50m mark but it would be a relatively easy one to rubber-stamp.",
      "West Ham - Daniel Cummings (Celtic)",
      "West Ham certainly need some additions after their disappointing campaign. Young Celtic star Daniel Cummings will join West Ham this summer at the end of his contract and the move could be announced imminently.",
      "Wolves - Kieran Morrison (Liverpool)",
      "With Cunha on the move, Wolves need to add bodies in attack. But it appears that their concentration is elsewhere for now. Reports have suggested that the Black Country side have made an approach for young Liverpool midfielder Kieran Morrison.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "And finally… Headmaster Sav has been compiling his end-of-term reports for Premier League pupils, and some will be feeling the swish of his cane.",
      "Manchester United and Southampton, see me in the detention room; Liverpool, Newcastle and Crystal Palace, go to the top of the class.",
      "Here are my scores out of 10 for each club overall in the 2024-25 campaign, in the order they finished, with my pre-season prediction for comparison.",
      "Thank you for all your comments and social media interaction, and have a great summer.",
      "Phenomenal first season for Arne Slot in the Premier League, winning the title at his first attempt as Jurgen Klopp’s successor, and yet it could have been even better.",
      "I wonder if he regrets that under-strength side at Plymouth in the FA Cup, poor performance in the Carabao Cup final or the agonising Champions League penalty shoot-out with Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Sav predicted: 5th",
      "Five years without a trophy or a cup final, fewer points than last season, and they failed to buy a centre-forward when everyone knew they were crying out for one.",
      "A huge missed opportunity when Man City were off the pace in the title race. Massive season ahead for Mikel Arteta.",
      "Sav predicted: 2nd",
      "From four titles in a row to no trophies and scrambling to finish in the top five on the last day of term.",
      "A season best forgotten, especially the awful Champions League blow-out - but I make them favourites to be back at No.1 next year.",
      "Sav predicted: Champions",
      "A trophy, a return to Champions League orbit and the Grand Slam of winning every trophy in Europe. Job done - now can Enzo Maresca build on it?",
      "And with respect, I’m not sure you’d hear Real Madrid bragging about winning the Europa Conference League.",
      "Sav predicted: 4th",
      "No wonder Eddie Howe has been given the freedom of the city. He ended the Toon’s 56-year wait for a trophy and he did it the hard way - beating Chelsea, Brentford, Arsenal and Liverpool. Qualifying for the Champions League was the icing on the cake.",
      "Sav predicted: 9th",
      "Nearly an unbelievable season, but in the end Unai Emery is back in the Europa League next season - a competition he’s won four times already.",
      "Great run in the Champions League and a poor decision at Old Trafford on the final day may have denied them an encore.",
      "Sav predicted: 8th",
      "They went from a points deduction and desperate relegation battle to the brink of the Champions League in 12 months.",
      "Yes, they had to settle for the UEFA Conference League in the end, but Nuno Espirito Santo’s side gave fans a great run for their money.",
      "Sav predicted: 15th",
      "Missed out on European football by a whisker, and it looks like striker Joao Pedro could be leaving the Amex.",
      "But plenty of promise in Fabian Hurzeler’s first season. And only four clubs scored more goals than the Seagulls.",
      "Sav predicted: 14th",
      "A top-half finish and Andoni Iraola won deserved plaudits for their dynamic football, especially taking Newcastle apart on their own patch and home wins against Arsenal and Manchester City. But losing Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez at the back will hurt them.",
      "Sav predicted: 16th",
      "They will do well to keep arguably the best front three outside the top six - Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Kevin Schade - together.",
      "But they made light of losing Ivan Toney last summer and the Bees’ recruitment is exceptional. Keeping hold of manager Thomas Frank is imperative.",

      "Nearly, but not quite. They threatened to break into the top six or win the FA Cup but fell short.",
      "As long as Marco Silva stays in charge at Craven Cottage, they will be safe - but they need to break through that glass ceiling.",

      "Sav predicted: 10th",
      "A wasted season. They were never in danger of going down - but never in danger of winning a cup or getting into Europe. Spent big after appointing Julen Lopetegui last summer and had nothing to show for it. Must do better.",
      "Sav predicted: 7th",
      "Worst Premier League season in their history, no trophies, terrible performance in the Europa League final.",
      "One of the biggest budgets in Europe but won only 11 of 38 league games. Nobody could have dreamed it would be as bad as this. Ruben Amorim needs a total rebuild.",
      "Sav predicted: 3rd",
      "Before Vitor Pereira came in, they were in big trouble and shipping goals for fun. But he strung together six wins in a row and won the hearts of fans by celebrating with them in the pub. Matheus Cunha is off to United, so that’s a big piece of the jigsaw to replace.",
      "Sav predicted: 17th",
      "Absolutely dreadful in the league, where they lost 22 games, but Ange Postecoglou won Spurs’ first trophy in 17 years - even if it was in a competition where they were among the favourites from the outset. If his remit was Champions League football, he’s delivered.",
      "Sav predicted: 6th",
      "I thought they would go down, so it’s no surprise they are back in the Championship. But sacking Steve Cooper made little sense and to go five months without even scoring a goal or winning a single point at home was diabolical.",
      "Sav predicted: 18th",
      "Again, no surprise that they went down - but the Tractor Boys were one of the biggest spenders in Europe last summer (£120 million) and I expected them to put up more of a fight than just six points from the last available 54.",
      "Sav predicted: 19th",
      "Sorry, but Saints were pathetic. If they hadn’t beaten Derby’s record low of 11 points I would have given them a big fat zero marks, but they managed to beat the Rams’ low-water mark in 2008 by a single point.",

Fernandes, 30, has an offer on the table from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal worth a staggering £700,000 per week - and the Portuguese midfielder is seriously considering accepting it.",

Earlier this week, talks between his agent, Miguel Pinho, and Al-Hilal representatives, reportedly stretched late into the night at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh.",

      "However, Brentford have reluctantly accepted that after nearly six years in west London, Mbeumo could now be set to depart the club and move onto pastures new.",
      "United and Newcastle are eyeing the 25-year-old but Frank insists the Bees won't rollover during transfer negotiations.",

      "When Manchester United players got wind that a post-season tour was a certainty, a delegation on behalf of the first team squad approached the football leadership team to express their dismay.",
      "One senior player complained that his family holiday, booked for the half-term week after the season ended, would have to be cancelled. Another suggested that players would try to cry off and avoid a 14,150-mile round trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong.",
      "In response to that warning, United brought the departure time of their outbound flight forward to Sunday evening, hours after the final game of the season against Aston Villa. That reduced the possibility of any last-minute withdrawals. Injured trio Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Luke Shaw all boarded the plane to Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Shaw's parents, partner and children boarded a plane for Dubai that night. Jonny Evans's wife, Helen, children and extended family were on the same flight. The WAGs' spouses might have wished they could join them.",
      "Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are both leaving United and were absent from the tour, with personal reasons cited. Lindelof's wife, Maja, is due to give birth to their third child and Eriksen is about to get married to his long-time partner Sabrina Kvist Jensen.",
      "Well-placed sources have said the United players were \"fuming\" to be in Asia after a 60-game season. They are unlikely to generate any sympathy after a trophyless campaign and 15th-placed finish. United did get to lift a cup in Hong Kong, one so undervalued a press officer carried it back to the dressing room.",
      "Some United sources assured the mood was better than expected after last week's demoralising Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Every player conducted the obligatory post-match meet-and-greets in the Hong Kong National Stadium on Friday evening, including a moody Alejandro Garnacho, this time minus his sunglasses.",
      "United's six days away from home Manchester were effectively condensed into four. Tuesday was teeming with commercial player appearances, with some lasting two hours. Players gladhanded guests on behalf of club sponsors Adidas, Tezos and Snapdragon, among others.",
      "Wednesday marked the now infamous Maybank-sponsored open-top bus journey that Zirkzee, De Ligt and Ayden Heaven were on board for. A United source insists it was not arranged with the intention of parading the Europa League trophy around Kuala Lumpur and that it was billed as a bus tour.",
      "In United's view, this was an example of the distinction between engagement with local fans and overseas fans. The bus ride was lapped up by locals. Back home, it was a source of embarrassment for those still reeling from the Bilbao blow.",
      "Adidas hosted a poolside party on the deck of the W Hotel after the defeat to the ASEAN All Stars on Wednesday evening. Several guests attended the nocturnal gathering and admired the sight of the glistening Petronas Twin Towers in the background.",
      "There was more commercial activity on Friday ahead of the second friendly with a Hong Kong XI. United held more meet-and-greets following their arrival in Hong Kong on Thursday, with a minor training session held in the rain. Mason Mount and Altay Bayindir featured after their non-appearances in Malaysia.",
      "Three of their teammates were in India. Andre Onana, Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium at half-time on Wednesday to board a private jet to Mumbai. Despite intense commercial activities planned, the trio were happy to volunteer as they got to return home earlier.",
      "After United were beaten by the ASEAN All Stars, there was gallows humour on the team bus back to the W Hotel. The booing at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium had not gone unnoticed by players and staff. Ruben Amorim reminded the media in Hong Kong there had been loud cheering, too.",
      "There were some farcical post-match scenes in Kuala Lumpur. United had to collect silver medals for the second Wednesday running, but the procession was delayed. The referee and linesmen had returned to their dressing room but had to be called back out to receive their medals, so United were forced to endure an inordinate wait.",
      "A United player half-joked the post-season tour would be \"like a stag do\". Some players were tempted to venture out beyond the house arrest of the team hotel but were advised by a senior player to stay in.",
      "United staff let their hair down on the trip. Some enjoyed drinks on the 14-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur while players had permission to head out into Kuala Lumpur on their first night in the Malaysian capital, flanked by security. A source said nothing \"crazy\" happened.",
      "Sources say the players returned at a reasonable time. United did not bother adjusting to the seven-hour time zone difference as training and commercial obligations were always held in the afternoons and evenings.",
      "Club sources acknowledged the trip was not as disciplined as a pre-season tour and that players could be more frivolous. Garnacho, Amad and Heaven headed out on e-scooters that had to be paid for by clued-up locals. Zirkzee was not taken by the room service on offer at the W Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, so headed across the road for some Thai take-out, again accompanied by a security guard.",
      "On the eighth floor of United's hotel in Kuala Lumpur there was a vending machine that dispensed mini bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne, priced at £40. If any United representative was of that persuasion it would have been to drown their sorrows after a shocking season.",
      "Happy faces were put on for signing sessions yet United players still made headlines with some explicit gestures. Amad raised his middle finger to fans he claimed were abusing his mother. Garnacho has done it multiple times without provocation. The players were advised to stop making the offensive gesture.",
      "Those on the tour have found Garnacho to be surly. He promised the All Stars forward Sergio Aguero that he would give him his shirt after the game. Instead, Garnacho blanked Aguero and United staff had to arrange for a shirt to be gifted to the Malaysian as a memento. It was noticeable in Hong Kong how carefully some of United's staff shadowed Garnacho as he signed shirts and posed for pictures, never breaking into a smile.",
      "Garnacho was one of the last to board the team bus after the All Stars defeat. With midnight looming, he donned sunglasses and ignored requests in the mixed zone. An eyewitness said he removed the shades almost immediately after he walked past the packed pen and surmised they were donned at the behest of personal sponsors. It still projected a brattish attitude.",
      "Beyond some of the imagery that has emerged on social media, Garnacho also stuck his middle finger up at one of the United photographers after the All Stars match. Amorim started to chuckle when the remote possibility of Garnacho staying was raised at a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday.",
      "Amorim cheerfully admitted to a colleague how exhausting the post-season tour had been, especially in the humidity of Malaysia. The Portuguese will oversee his first pre-season tour with United in July, a condensed and relatively low-key return to the United States, spent primarily in Chicago.",
      "The prestige of the United manager's role has dawned on him. \"It's more than a coach,\" Amorim admitted. \"On this tour, I had a small meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia.",
      "\"You have to improve as a person, as a leader, you have to control the momentum. Sometimes after games you see I'm really frustrated, I'm trying to control that. The only thing I want is to improve the team and have results, when you have results you can manage the team so much easier.\"",
      "It would be easier if Bruno Fernandes stayed but the United captain is giving serious consideration to an approach from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal. Figures at United empathise with Fernandes, who has not shied from the subject with confidants. They would not blame him if he were to up sticks after five-and-a-half years of underachievement with United. Fernandes has not formally told United he wants to leave.",
      "There is understandable concern at the prospect of United minus Fernandes. His leadership has been apparent even over the past few days in Asia, where he bought staff drinks at the hotel bar and was generous with post-match autograph requests from Malaysian fans who had crammed into the mixed zone. It was the same in Hong Kong. Fernandes was ushered to the team coach by three secruity guards.",
      "United's stay in Hong Kong was so whistlestop that they were barely in the country for 36 hours. After an early-morning flight, the team spent around an hour at their second W Hotel to freshen up and have lunch. Then it was back on the bus to the Hong Kong Stadium for training and more meet-and-greets.",
      "With ample time to reflect on their worst season in 51 years, some within the United camp are already at the end of their tether with many in the squad. The widespread consensus is that the players do not play to their maximum in every match, as evidenced by the contrast in their Europa League and Premier League form.",
      "During the open training session in Kuala Lumpur, United's back-to-front attacks were constructed at a glacial pace. One of the inflatable mannequins quickly deflated.",
      "That is how the players would feel if they have to embark on another post-season trek."

      "Manchester United brought their post-season tour to an end with a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.",
      "After trailing 1-0 at half-time, United flipped the game on its head in the second half via a brace from Chido Obi and a late header from Ayden Heaven.",
      "It marked a victorious conclusion to a 67-game season that everyone associated with United will be keen to forget about as quickly as possible.",
      "With the tour now wrapped up and the season officially done and dusted, full focus switches to the summer transfer window and the start of next season. But following the conclusion of the tour of Asia, which saw United visit Malaysia before travelling to Hong Kong, MEN Sport has picked out four post-tour talking points:",
      "After being informed by Ruben Amorim prior to last Sunday's Premier League finale against Aston Villa at Old Trafford that he will be free to leave the club this summer, the last thing Alejandro Garnacho would have wanted is to travel to Asia on a post-season tour and participate in two meaningless friendlies.",
      "After starting the 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur on the bench, Garnacho was named in the starting XI for the win over Hong Kong. Despite earning cheers from supporters every time he touched the ball and attempting to be inventive when he had possession, his mannerisms off the pitch were not of somebody in a good mood.",
      "United staff shadowed him carefully during a signing session in Hong Kong, during which he never broke into a smile. He also ignored requests to speak to journalists in the mixed zone after the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars, walking straight through, donning dark sunglasses as midnight approached.",
      "The biggest positive of the post-season tour by a country mile was Obi claiming his first goals for United's first-team, netting a smart brace in the win in Hong Kong. For his first goal, he swivelled inside the box and fired a clinical left-footed shot into the back of the net.",
      "His second goal was all about his intelligent movement and reading of the game. Recognising Mason Mount, who also impressed in the second half against Hong Kong, was about to float a ball into the box, the young Dane was quick to make a run across his man and glance a header into the bottom corner.",
      "Obi, in that move alone, produced much better movement inside the box than fellow countryman Rasmus Hojlund did at any point across his two starts on tour. Hojlund's box movement is one of his biggest flaws.",
      "Obi, meanwhile, looked razor-sharp against Hong Kong and his two goals, despite not being competitive strikes, will have done him the world of good. With a full pre-season under his belt, he could get a more prominent role in the squad next season.",
      "The main purpose of United's trip to Asia may have been for commercial reasons, with the six-day trip expected to bank them somewhere between £8million and £10m, but that was never going to create headlines. Instead, transfer talk was always going to do fill column inches.",
      "After Amorim, sitting alongside Mount at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, said United \"cannot do much\" in this summer's window, Omar Berrada, the following day, said United will have to be \"prudent\" in their attempts to strengthen the squad ahead of next season.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now,\" Berrada told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve. So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition.\"",
      "With that in mind, United are unlikely to be able to attack the transfer window as much as they would have liked. Instead, as a result of missing out on the improved revenue streams that would have come with securing Champions League qualification, they will have to be that little be wiser and shrewder.",
      "One of the biggest positives United have had to shout about this calendar year have been the performances of January recruit Heaven. Despite only making six competitive appearances before the end of the season and two on the tour, the 18-year-old defender has not put a foot wrong since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He has a solid reading of the game, his positional awareness is spot on and his ability on the ball is excellent. As a left-footer, he could find himself ahead of Lisandro Martinez in the race to start on the left of the back-three come the end of next season.",
      "Although Hong Kong did not provide the sternest test United have ever faced, Heaven, following his half-time introduction, was able to progress the ball really well from deep areas and help his teammates get up the pitch. Those ball-playing credentials in a centre-back and becoming more and more important in the modern game, and United appear to have uncovered a gem."

      "Ruben Amorim is now just hours away from embarking on his first summer transfer window as Manchester United head coach.",
      "The window will initially open on Sunday before briefly closing again on Tuesday, June 10. The window is opening earlier than usual due to an exceptional registration period relating to the FIFA Club World Cup taking place this summer.",
      "The window will then reopen on Monday, June 16 until the 7pm deadline on Monday, September 1, meaning clubs will have plenty of time to get deals over the line and their squads in order for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "For United, a summer transfer window has never felt so important. The club experienced its worst campaign in 51 years this season and much-needed changes are required across the board.",
      "However, as a result of missing out on European qualification for next term, United will not be able to make as many alterations as they would have been able to had they made it into the Champions League. Amorim admitted this week United \"cannot do much\".",
      "It means player sales, which could include the departures of Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes, could dictate what United are capable of. They want to strengthen their attack as a priority and are already well on their way to doing so.",
      "Barring any late hiccups, Wolves star Matheus Cunha will become their first signing of the summer. United remain in talks with the Midlands outfit over how to structure the payment of his £62.5million release clause.",
      "If and when United get that deal over the line, he is expected to slot straight into Amorim's first-choice XI and occupy the left-sided No.10 spot. He is well-versed playing that role in a three-at-the-back formation.",
      "United had also earmarked Ipswich Town ace Liam Delap as their priority target to strengthen the No.9 position. United desperately need a striker this summer and Delap was an attainable option at £30m.",
      "However, he is now on the cusp of joining Chelsea, meaning United's search for a striker is going to have to lead them elsewhere.",
      "Despite scoring 12 goals for a relegated side this season, Delap is still raw and unproven. United, instead, need a more established figure that can offer a greater guarantee of goals.",
      "Napoli's Victor Osimhen would be the ideal option for United. Napoli are keen to offload him as quickly as possible this summer after his loan spell at Galatasaray, which saw him score 36 goals, and he has a proven record of scoring goals just about everywhere he has been.",
      "Of course, the elephant in the room is that United cannot offer any prospective signings European football for next season. Osimhen would be a guaranteed starter and the prospect of achieving his dream of playing in the Premier League could convince him to make the move.",
      "Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo has also been linked with United over the past week or so and he would be another statement signing. He scored 20 Premier League goals this season and is going to command plenty of interest this summer.",
      "He would be a perfect fit for United's front-three, operating as the right-sided No.10. He also has the versatility that Amorim wants in his players.",
      "With strengthening the attack having to take priority this summer, the rest of United's squad may largely remain unchanged. Player sales, as already documented, will dictate what is available.",
      "There are cases for United to strengthen in the centre of midfield and in goal. However, United are reasonably well-stocked in other areas, meaning recruitment in lesser priority positions may have to wait beyond this summer.",
      "But if Fernandes is sold for the mooted £100m fee that Al-Hilal are reportedly ready to pay, more could be achievable. United, though, should be attempting to keep the Portuguese international amid his importance to the team.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",
      "Substitutes: Bayindir, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Dalot, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee, Obi."

      "In one of the locker rooms of the Hong Kong National Stadium, Matthijs de Ligt held court with the four English journalists who travelled on Manchester United's post-season tour.",
      "After the 15-minute chat, De Ligt told the United press officer that he was in his element. He used to conduct weekly hour-long interviews as Ajax captain. What is cathartic for one player is routine for a Dutch footballer.",
      "De Ligt started in two of United's 14 final matches of the season after sustaining separate injuries in the Premier League defeats at Nottingham Forest and Brentford a month apart. The latter, a knee injury, prevented him from appearing in the Europa League final.",
      "The 25-year-old travelled to Bilbao, donned United's Paul Smith final suit and was one of a handful of players to stride out onto the San Mames pitch. Despite his final weeks of the campaign being a write-off, De Ligt still travelled to Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong for United's post-season tour.",
      "He has conducted individual training sessions as he continues his recovery to be ready for the start of pre-season training in July.",
      "After an eventful first campaign with United, De Ligt sat down to speak at length about the post-season tour, United's annus horribilis, his relationship with Ruben Amorim and why football is becoming a turn-off.",
      "How's your injury at the moment?",
      "De Ligt: \"Yeah, it's going better. It's still not over yet obviously, otherwise I would be on the pitch yesterday. But yeah, it's getting a little bit better. There's some things that have to... it's not one thing, it's multiple things that have to come together. So I think it's good that the season almost ends and hopefully soon I can be back on the pitch and for pre-season back fit.",
      "You got injured in the Forest game. Was it a recurrence or a different injury?",
      "\"No, it was the Forest game, the Brentford game. It’s all... The body is not just one thing and it's all together.\"",
      "How is it being offered over here in this environment?",
      "\"Yeah, I mean I wouldn't say it's ideal, obviously, but it's the way it is. It's for the players to accept the things how they are. Also here I can do the job. The facilities are really good. The physios are here with us, so I'm not complaining about that.\"",
      "What will you do when you go home? Do you keep going to Carrington for treatment or will you go back to Holland? How will that work?",
      "\"Yeah, that's still something we have to discuss. Obviously it has been a really long season and the last one-and-a-half month I didn't play, but still I think everybody needs a holiday. But as I said, I think tomorrow, two days from now, we go back to Carrington and then we'll discuss what's the best plan.\"",
      "I was surprised when I put your age in, how young you are. Because I always think how young you were when you captained Ajax to that Champions League semi-final. It's almost kind of, not defining for your career, but it's a big focus point on your career. When we were saying that obviously next season Manchester United are not going to have European football and that will be the first time, I would imagine in your career that you've not experienced that?",
      "\"Well, I experienced it once. It was actually also after a Europa League final against United (in 2017), and the season after we reached the semi-final of the Champions League. So, let's keep that! On a serious note, I've been used to playing in the Champions League for my whole career, more or less. This season was the Europa League, but it was also really, really nice and obviously we reached the final and unfortunately we couldn't win it. Next season will be different with less games. I think more time to prepare for the games, so hopefully we can get the benefits from that.\"",
      "How much does that extra time help? Because Ruben's talked about it quite a lot. He came in November when the schedule was really packed. But looking forward to next year, three midweeks, that's more time out on the grass, isn't it?",
      "\"Yeah, I think obviously every player wants to play as many games as possible. So, it will be different. But I think for the manager, as you said, there's more time to train, more time also to have an intensive tactical session, because obviously you can still train tactical if you play a lot of games but you cannot put the intensity in because you're playing every two days a game. So, I think in that way, as the manager said, it could be an advantage and hopefully we can exploit that.\"",
      "Will you be watching the Champions League? Do you watch a lot of football or will it just be kind of you switch off from it?",
      "\"Well, I watched a lot of football when I was younger. The last years I lived it less because I have been busy and the football is changing a bit. But the big games I still watch, I still like, I still watch.\"",
      "Do you think football is becoming less exciting? There was a quote from Bielsa that it's becoming more of a business than a sport...",
      "\"Yeah, just speaking from my point of view, obviously I'm now 25. So, obviously everything that is from the past, I make it nicer than it was. But for me, football before was more interesting to watch. I think now it's what you said, it's a little bit more business, it's a little bit more about results and maybe the flair or the crazy actions where people are going for the statement becomes less and less. So I think that's the development now of football and let's see how it goes, if it stays or if it's changing. I don't know.\"",
      "When you signed for United, it felt like it was a long time coming because I'm sure you remember playing in Edwin van der Sar's testimonial against Manchester United's junior side and Jose Mourinho seemed to be really interested in you as well. One of the heads of the academy a few years ago also said that he really wanted to bring you to United. Do you remember any of those conversations when you were younger at all of United's interest?",
      "\"To be fair, before that summer I never really have spoken to United. I knew that in the summer I went to Juventus (in 2019), that United had a kind of interest, but I think they went for 'H' (Harry Maguire). So for me at that stage, the Premier League was a maybe, I said it also on interview, the Premier League is the biggest league in the world, the quickest league in the world and I felt at that point I was ready, but for my development it could have been better to go to another league a step above, but not the highest. It was never really an option for me, but that summer it was for the first time really an option.\"",
      "Can you tell me, there's been a lot of talk this season because it's not been a great season, about the pressure of playing for Manchester United and the weight of the shirt, which we tend to talk more about England, but it is a kind of factor with United. You've played for some of the biggest clubs, clearly Ajax are enormous in Holland, Bayern in Germany, Juventus in Italy. Is there a difference in pressure or is it just because you haven't won enough matches?",
      "\"I think it's the last [thing] as, what you said, the pressure is all the same. You need to win. I've been at Ajax, my first team, and there were moments where we were not playing good and they were also cynical. They were saying we scored, let's say we were 3-0 behind in the last minute, we scored 3-1, so we're still losing and they said 10, 10, 10, sarcastic. I'm used to that kind of thing.",
      "\"But I think the biggest difference right now is that this season was such below expectations that the pressure feels much more on you, especially because you don't get much joy because you don't win many games. It feels even more and more and more. I think that's what a lot of players are experiencing this season. As you can see, it also can change real quick, like you saw in the Europa League, how the emotions were also with the players and together with the fans. That's something that I think can be really tough, but it can also be amazing. I think hopefully next season we can make it amazing.\"",
      "What do you think has got to change next season specifically, not to be another below-par performance?",
      "\"I think what I'm experiencing now is what I like to see and that is what the manager is doing right now. I'm not speaking into details, but I have a feeling he's really looking at the spots. I'm not speaking about players only, but also about the whole culture and the way we are working at the club. I think he's really into details. Before signing new players, before signing new things, he's first looking at what is the culture, what needs to change, what can improve to become a better football club. I think from next season we will see more of that.\"",
      "How is he communicating that to you, or is it just something you've noticed yourself?",
      "\"I've got a really good relationship with him, to be fair. He's really open also with me, so it's really nice to speak with him. Obviously, I've experienced many managers. He's one of the managers who is the most easy to talk to as a player. In the same way, you can also see what he's doing, what he wants to do with the team. I think he wants to build a team of players who are together, especially, fighting for each other and making the most out of what they have.",
      "\"Maybe like before, you were united with the best players, but you're not a team. I think that's something that's really positive. Hopefully, next season, from the pre-season, we can work really strong on that because we have a lot of time.\"",
      "Do you think that's why he is so harsh with his words sometimes? Last night (Wednesday), the friendly crowd booed at the end. Does that work for you? Could it be too much sometimes?",
      "\"I'm from Holland so I like it! I can understand that for the media, they're in shock because they're like, normally this doesn't happen. But I think you can also, as a media, be really happy that finally someone speaks out and speaks out what he thinks and speaks the truth instead of going around and stuff like that. I really appreciate him in our conversations personally, how we speak. That gives me a feeling that I can trust him and he can trust me.\"",
      "How has it been with the back three/back two switch? I don't know how much you played that in your career previously. You must have done. What's that been like, that sort of progression and how can it be better next season? Because it feels like that's essential to having the formation be an attacking one rather than a back five almost.",
      "\"I think it's a discussion that comes up a lot, obviously. It's always like, oh, three in the back, four in the back. I think if you really analyse our games, it's not that static. It's in a way that we are always defending in a three, always in a four. I think in the build-up, all the European teams, the big European teams play with a three in the back. They switch the midfielder in the back or a full-back who comes back. So it's always in a three.",
      "\"But then maybe the difference is that sometimes, how do you... what kind of players do you put in certain positions? How do you want to play? You can play with five in the back or you can play with three in the back. It's completely different. I think that's something that we will see maybe a little bit more from us next season. Hopefully we can give also the fans a little bit more joy also in the way of playing and also, especially ourselves also, in showing what we can do.\"",
      "For you in particular, having played for Erik at Ajax, was it a drastic difference for you going from playing under him and then changing to Ruben?",
      "\"Well, I've experienced a lot of managers in my career already. So I think I can say that I adapted quite well to the new manager. Obviously for me, the position, it changes but it's not that much. It's more like right centre back with Erik or it's like right centre back in the middle of a three. Obviously it's a difference but it's manageable. So yeah, obviously when you have a new manager, it's always finding out how he works, what he wants and as I said, we have a good relationship. so it was quite easy for me.: So yeah, it was okay. It was nice.\"",
      "So how important, given you lost the final and what happens this season, how important is it to make a good start? Because you talk about pressure, you can really do without that or coming back on you straight away next season?",
      "\"Yeah, but that's for every club. I mean, every club it's important to start well, to start strong. As we said, we have a really long pre-season now to prepare us for the new league. So yeah, that will be really important and obviously, especially after this season, it's also for us, I think an obligation to defend.\"",
      "I saw you singing with gusto the 'Glory Glory Man United' song. But you seem to take that responsibility seriously at that level, having been a captain at such a young age. What do you put into that? What kind of value do you think that gives players that connection with the fans?",
      "\"No, obviously really important. I mean, we know we had a difficult season this season. so from the outside it's really easy to say, oh, what are they doing now? They go on the bus and stuff like that. But you obviously have to deal also with millions of fans in Asia who are probably also for the club really important, for us as players also really important and obviously don't see us as often as the people from Manchester or from England. So that's why these trips are so important for us and for them. It's so valuable because it really gives you a connection for us to see how they view us but also for them to see us close. So I think even if it's after a season like this, it's not the easiest trip but it's so nice for us to show our love also to the fans. So yeah, it's good.",
      "And the next open-top bus parade (after his appearance on one in Kuala Lumpur) will be with a trophy?",
      "\"Yeah, that would be nice!\""

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, May 31.",
      "United's transfer business doesn't appear to be stopping. After agreeing a deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, Ruben Amorim's side are continuing to be linked with more attackers to bolster the current crop.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, who is set to join Chelsea for £30million, United are back to square one in their hunt for a new centre-forward. Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres are two prime targets after scoring a combined 91 goals between them this season.",
      "There have even been reports that recruitment director, Matt Hargreaves, is in Naples to try and thrash out a deal. Osimhen will likely want to get his business done sooner rather than later, considering how his high-profile switch, last summer, fell through on deadline day.",
      "Sporting's Gyokeres has also been linked to United, owing to his close relationship with Amorim. However, it appears the club are in a long queue for him which now looks to include Liverpool.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is also a target for United. However, any more incomings after a striker aren't expected to be pursued until funds are raised through player sales. Unfortunately, that could mean Bruno Fernandes leaves the club amid ongoing links to the lucrative Saudi Pro League.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "Ex-Manchester United man Gordon Strachan struggles to see how Matheus Cunha would fit into Ruben Amorim's current system at Old Trafford and beyond.",
      "United have identified Cunha as a primary target this summer, as they look to improve their attack under Amorim. Cunha's notable tally of 15 Premier League goals in just 31 outings during the 2024/2025 season has also reportedly caught the eye of Arsenal, who are keen on enhancing their forward options.",
      "Read more here",
      "Now then, according to German outlet Kicker (via Mundo Deportivo) have claimed that Erik ten Hag wants to bring Antony to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Obviously, Ten Hag brought Antony to United and after arriving in Leverkusen, could bring him to Germany.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has a huge decision to make which could change Manchester United's future under Ruben Amorim.",
      "What happens next will be pivotal to United's 2025/26 campaign - a season where the Reds' status as one of Europe's leading clubs is under threat. That's not to say they won't remain a big club, but after finishing so low in the top-flight, teams like Newcastle and Chelsea, never mind Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City, are becoming more fashionable to support for younger fans across the globe.",
      "It's why selling Fernandes is such a bad idea after the season United have had. Imagine where they would have been without him? It's not a stretch to suggest that they could have been looking over their shoulders at the Premier League's bottom three.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Portuguese publication A Bola are claiming that United are ‘considering making an offer’ for Pedro Goncalves. It is said that the possibility will only increase if Bruno Fernandes is sold.",
      "The forward played as a left-sided No.10 under current Reds boss Ruben Amorim at Sporting. Goncalves scored 81 goals and provided 57 assists across 190 games under Amorim.",
      "Sporting’s position is reportedly that he can only leave if his €80m (£67m) release clause is triggered. It is said that the Portuguese champions want to renew his contract, but they will wait to see if there could be any movements in the upcoming summer transfer window.",
      "Real Betis have opened negotiations to secure a permanent deal for Antony this summer.",
      "Spanish outlet Marca have claimed that a meeting has been scheduled for next week between Betis and United to 'assess various scenarios'.",
      "Extending his loan for another year is an option but it's claimed that United want to sell Antony permanently.",
      "Man United will turn their attention to Sporting CP playmaker Pedro Goncalves of Bruno Fernandes secures a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Portuguese outlet A Bola have claimed that United have identified the former Wolves star as a replacement for Fernandes. The report claims that United are considering an appaorach for Goncalves.",
      "Goncalves is said to have a good relationship with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Barcelona have identified Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli as an alternative to Marcus Rashford, should they not secure a deal with Manchester United.",
      "Spanish outlet Sport has claimed that Barca's 'plan is to try a loan' for Rashford with them deeming €40m too much to pay for him. It's claimed that, if they were to spend money, they would look at Luis Diaz.",
      "Martinelli and Kingsley Coman are two players they could look to sign permanently over Rashford.",
      "Man United are one of the clubs interested in former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham, accoridng to reports.",
      "Graeme Bailey has reported that they have been approached by the forward's entourage a possible move back to England. Abraham spent this season on loan at AC Milan, scoring 10 goals.",
      "West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have also all shown interest.",
      "A different one here.",
      "According to Football Transfers, Man United have expressed an interest in Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson. It comes after they missed out on Liam Delap, who is joining Chelsea.",
      "Jackson has scored 24 Premier League goals in the past two seasons.",
      "Italian journalist Matteo Moretto has claimed that Juventus have made contact with Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The striker is reportedly one of the forward's the Italian side want to bring in as their top target.",
      "Hello and welcome to our dedicated Manchester United transfer blog!",
      "My name is Josh Holland and I will be your man for all stuff United this Saturday morning. After the blow of Liam Delap turning the club down, Victor Osimhen now seems to be the priority.",
      "He was on the scoresheet once again last night in his final Galatasaray game. Could he be on his way to Old Trafford?",
      "Stay tuned as we bring you every rumour, exclusives and opinion throughout the day.",
      "According to The Athletic, Delap will undergo his medical on Monday ahead of a potential move to Chelsea.",
      "The report claims Chelsea met the £30m release clause in the striker's contract. This was activated following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship.",
      "Despite attracting interest from the likes of Man United, AC Milan and Juventus - Delap has informed the Blues over his preference to move to west London.",
      "Chido Obi put in an impressive display for Man United in their post-season fixture against Hong Kong.",
      "The young striker scored twice as United claimed a 3-1 victory at the Hong Kong Stadium. Ayden Heaven was also on the score-sheet after Jorginho put the hosts in front, as United made a second-half comeback with three goals.",
      "Obi currently wears the No.56 shirt for United, which is the same number which was handed to him when he first arrived at Old Trafford and featured for the first-team. This summer could be the time that United put their faith in the striker and give him a new number for the upcoming season.",
      "Several numbers are set to be available to new signings this summer - as well as for current members of the squad who are deserving of an upgrade. If United do decide to give Obi a new number there are several options available. The No.19 is currently vacant at United, having previously been worn by Raphael Varane until his departure in the summer of 2024. No.14 is also set to be available once Christian Eriksen leaves as a free agent.",
      "No.10 is currently worn by Marcus Rashford, No.12 by Tyrell Malacia and No.21 by Antony, with all three men facing uncertain futures going into the summer. United also have every number from 27 up to 36 available, to either new signings or for in-house upgrades.",
      "It has been another remarkable season for Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting Clube de Portugal, having won the Liga Portugal Betclic and the Portuguese Cup, while he was also named Player of the Season amid ongoing transfer links to Man United.",
      "As he now prepares to join up with the Sweden national team, coach Jon Dahl Tomasson was inevitably asked whether he could offer any hints about the player's future.",
      "\"Of course, I'm not going to say,\" he said when asked about which club Gyokeres should join. \"Otherwise there would be an explosion. There will definitely be players changing clubs.",
      "\"We know that every year. If we look at each player, the right choice must be made before heading to a certain club. We also have family and we have to keep that in mind. It's not easy. At the end of the day, that is football.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes' future at Manchester United has become the subject of intense speculation in recent days following the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season.",
      "The news should not come as any real surprise to the club, given the 30-year-old’s response when he signed a contract extension in August last year. At the time, he is said to have made it clear to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he expected the club to sign top-tier players capable of competing at the highest level.",

With interest in the former Troyes man expected to be rife this summer, Bees chief Frank has made it clear the Londoners must attempt to try and command the biggest fee possible for him this summer.",
      "\"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" Frank told Tipsbladet. \"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him.",
      "\"I would be surprised with what he has to offer. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\"",
      "According to Spanish newspaper Marca, Betis are expected to submit another loan offer for Antony.",

      "“Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "\"He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong. But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.\"",

      "He was not present during the post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong following talks with Amorim and technical director Jason Wilcox. Sources say Georgson acknowledged there was less space in the new set-up for the role he was originally brought in for. Amorim has put his assistant, Carlos Fernandes, in charge of set pieces.",
      "Georgson said: \"It has been a fantastic experience serving as first team coach at Manchester United and I will always be proud of my association with such a great football club. This period of my career has now come to an end as I leave to find a new challenge elsewhere. While excited about the opportunities ahead, I am sad to be leaving so many great colleagues and friends at Carrington, who make Manchester United truly special.",
      "\"Even during such a tough season, the professionalism and dedication of the players and staff never wavered and I know there will be better times ahead. I want to thank Jason, Ruben and Erik for the opportunities they gave me, and wish everyone at the club the best of luck for the future.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim does not think Bruno Fernandes will leave Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes is giving serious consideration to leaving the club and his agent, Miguel Pinho, was pictured meeting officials from the Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr.",
      "The 30-year-old captained United in a 3-1 win against a Hong Kong XI in their final post-season tour match on Friday and was substituted at half-time as Amorim fielded an entirely different team for the second half.",
      "Fernandes has not told United if he wants to leave and he conducted meet-and-greet signing sessions with fans after the match. Although Amorim hopes his compatriot remains at Old Trafford, he also admitted no one knows for certain whether Fernandes will stay or go.",

      "In January, the Reds agreed a loan deal until the end of the season with the Seville club for Antony and it was an unexpected success.",
      "United's loanee became a key player for Real Betis and helped them qualify for the Conference League final. Despite falling just short of European glory, it remains a good season for the La Liga club as they bagged a spot in next season's Europa League thanks to their domestic finish.",

      "The United duo hold good relationships with Ten Hag and both men are available to be sold this summer.",

      "In a press conference when asked about the importance of Champions League football to attract players, Amorim insisted that players would be signing for the wrong reasons if they only wanted to play for United because of the competition.",
      "Gyokeres deal? I didn't talk to him. But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.",

      "Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations. Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season, even the environment in training ground can help all these players have more confidence. If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals we will try to assess that and be prepared."

      "Never has a summer transfer window felt so important for Manchester United.",
      "After experiencing their worst season in 51 years, United are about embark on a period in which as many changes need to be made as realistically possible. The window will open on Sunday for 10 days before closing again on June 10.",
      "It will then reopen again on June 16 and stay open until the final klaxon sounds on September 1. Just how United's squad will look come then is anyone's guess.",
      "After losing last week's Europa League final in Bilbao, United will not be able to oversee the volume of changes they would have liked had they qualified for the Champions League. Head coach Ruben Amorim has already admitted they \"cannot do much\" this summer.",
      "Nevertheless, there are some decisions that will have to be made. With that said, here are United's leading priorities for this summer:",
      "Missing out on Liam Delap's signature is not necessarily as big a 'blow' as some United fans might fear. The 22-year-old, who is set to join Chelsea, has spent just one season as a Premier League regular, scoring 12 goals in an Ipswich Town side that won just four league games all season.",
      "As respectable as his tally was, the difference in expectations between Ipswich and United are worlds apart. The pressure at United is ten-fold in comparison.",
      "United, this summer, should be making the addition of a proven and established goalscorer their top priority. They have finished the last two Premier League seasons with a negative goal difference and that is unacceptable.",
      "United need someone who can come in, hit the ground running and score goals at a consistent rate. Strikers of that ilk are not cheap, but United, at this juncture, cannot afford to go another season without a reliable goalscorer leading their attack.",
      "News of Bruno Fernandes considering his future at Old Trafford amid interest from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal could leave United with a massive decision to make. A bid worth £100million is being mooted and the prospect of that officially being put to United could test their resolve.",
      "A bid of such strength could convince United to cash-in on a player who will turn 31 in September. On the flip side, they may believe his importance to the team is just too great.",
      "United would have been worse off without him this season, highlighted by his return of 19 goals and 20 assists across all competitions, meaning that thought must be considered in their thinking. He is their jewel in a broken crown and losing him could damage it even further.",
      "Player sales will dictate exactly what is achievable for United this summer in terms of incomings. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen will set the ball rolling when their contracts expire and more departures will follow.",
      "United have already informed Garnacho he will be sold if a suitable offer comes along, while Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales. The trio all spent time out on loan this season.",
      "Elsewhere, United should be aiming to try and offload Altay Bayindir, Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia, and Casemiro. Shifting them, however, is much easier said than done.",
      "But if United are serious about revamping the squad to the best of their ability, they need to point those who do not have long-term futures at the club in the direction of the exit.",
      "Bayindir has not covered himself in glory when he has donned the gloves, and he should be sold, meaning United must recruit an improved backup goalkeeper to challenge Onana at the very least.",
      "You can also make an argument for United attempting to sign a new No.1. Onana has made too many costly errors since succeeding David de Gea and can no longer be assured of automatically being the starting goalkeeper by default.",
      "In back-to-back summers, United gambled a combined £108.5m on two players they thought would strengthen their attack. Rasmus Hojlund arrived for a fee that could rise to £72m from Atalanta in August 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee arrived from Bologna 11 months later.",
      "Neither of them have shown anywhere enough to suggest they can lead United's attack, with Hojlund regressing this season and Zirkzee soon making it clear he is not a No.9.",
      "If United sell either/both of them this summer, they will have to accept losses on the pair. Their current valuations are nowhere near the fees United paid for them.",
      "United would be better off cutting their losses and selling one of them at the very least. Based on this calendar year, Zirkzee is the more attractive option to keep, meaning Hojlund would be the prime candidate to offload.",
      "United are already well on their way to achieving this ambition by attempting to wrap up the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha. United are prepared to pay his £62.5m release clause and are currently in talks over the structure of the payments.",
      "United need fresh blood in their attacking department and Cunha, on the back of a 15-goal Premier League season, is just the sort of signing they should be making.",
      "Depending on what happens elsewhere, there is also an argument to suggest they should bring in another No.10, especially if Amad is deployed as a right wing-back. However, the size of their budget will dictate what is possible on that front."

      "A Serie A title winner, an Eredivisie title winner, the top scorer in Ligue 1, a European winner, a European finalist, another promoted to the Premier League and a West Ham player of the year. They have all left Manchester United within the past 12 months.",
      "Has anyone checked on Willy Kambwala? It turns out Villarreal finished fifth in La Liga to qualify for the Europa League. Another solid effort.",
      "And United still got it right to sell or loan Scott McTominay, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Greenwood, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Hannibal Mejbri, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Kambwala.",
      "McTominay is the most contentious. He was named the MVP (a commercialised term in a footballing country as pure as Italy) in Serie A after inspiring Napoli to a fourth Scudetto in their history. In Naples, McTominay is worthy of mention in the same breath as Maradona.",
      "The Scot tallied 10 goals in his final season for United when goals were hard to come by. Rasmus Hojlund, a purported No.9, scraped that many in 2024-25. McTominay got 12 for Napoli.",
      "But McTominay was expendable. United needed a defensive midfielder and to accommodate one, someone had to make way. McTominay was the only sellable asset.",
      "And, at times, he was neither here nor there. Erik ten Hag could not make his mind up as to whether McTominay was defensive or attack-minded. McTominay's two lifesaving goals past the 90-minute mark against Brentford made Ten Hag's mind up for him. Occasionally, he would turn on the charm, such as when he hugged a sympathetic female broadcaster in the MCG mixed zone in Melbourne.",
      "Not everyone was sorry to see the back of McTominay, either. \"Where do you want me?\" he brusquely asked a press officer at Carrington last season.",
      "Shifting McTominay was not exactly as incendiary as Mark Hughes, Paul Ince or Andrei Kanchelskis leaving in 1995. The only Premier League club that bid for him were Fulham, as close as you can get to an early retirement home in the top flight.",
      "Fulham are not synonymous with ambition. They are a stable club in a salubrious area of London, so the appeal is obvious. A year earlier, West Ham United tried to lure McTominay down the M6.",
      "Napoli finished tenth in 2023-24. Italy remains a league in decline since the Calciopoli scandal in 2006. Its top flight has been a dumping ground for English clubs for years.",
      "And Antonio Conte is a stickler for a United reject. He had four of them at Inter Milan - Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez, Matteo Darmian and Ashley Young.",
      "This is not to diminish McTominay's fabulous feat and he is destined to be deified in Naples. Conte is a demanding coach and he recognised McTominay's robustness and goal-getting nous. A midfielder who is comfortably a top-half Premier League-level player is bound to have a profound effect on a mid-table Italian side.",
      "So United cashed in. The risk was the replacement. Replacing McTominay, remoulded as an attacking midfielder by Ten Hag, with a defensive midfielder ought to have made comparisons with Manuel Ugarte moot.",
      "Only Ugarte has been the poorest of United's five summer signings. So much so he was benched for the Europa League final. He is 24 and appears ill-prepared to anchor a midfield that Casemiro has retaken brief ownership of.",
      "Nobody foresaw the spiral at United. Now, of course, McTominay would improve their defence, midfield or attack. The somewhat contrary case to keep McTominay would have been as a striker. He is no shrinking violet and his instinct in front of goal trumps Hojlund's.",
      "United negotiated a fee rising to £50.75m for Ugarte. Napoli will pay a maximum of £30m for McTominay. It is not the first time United have miscalculated players' value.",
      "Or misjudged it. Alvaro Fernandez, never afforded a debut at United, was mismanaged by Ten Hag before he was sold to Benfica for an up-front fee of £5.1m. The word is he will now go back to where it started at Real Madrid.",
      "United would bank a sell-on fee if Fernandez is sold. His sale last year was totally logical as Ten Hag had no time for him. Left back was Ten Hag's blind spot, whether it be signing Malacia, sanctioning a new contract for Luke Shaw, loaning in Sergio Reguilon, shifting Diogo Dalot there or selling Fernandez.",
      "Fernandez, 22, was a Champions League knockout participant with Benfica this season. So was Marcus Rashford with Aston Villa.",
      "Of all the United departures, the loudest noise surrounded Rashford, who rarely hit the right notes at Aston Villa. His impact was grossly overstated before a hamstring injury curtailed his time at Villa Park. Unai Emery will not be having him back.",
      "DELAP A DODGED BULLET",
      "After Michael Owen scored his first United goal at Wigan Athletic, there was a rendition of \"You Scouse b*****d\" in the away end. Some United fans at the DW Stadium that day would assure you the derision was genuine.",
      "Some lapped up Owen having the chutzpah to move to United, despite his Liverpool links. Others saw through him. He had tried to engineer a return to Liverpool earlier that summer when the only serious suitors were Stoke City and Hull City. Then Sir Alex Ferguson, a fellow horse racing addict, invited him to breakfast.",
      "You wonder whether Liam Delap would have ever overcome the 'City reject' tag had he opted for United over Chelsea. He would have been under more scrutiny than Hojlund and is only four days younger.",
      "The United technical director Jason Wilcox watched Delap develop at City's academy when he was its director. If he was not good enough for City, then he should not be deemed good enough for United.",
      "Factually, Delap is. He is better than any of United's strikers. But United need a proven goalscorer, not another No.9 with potential. They have ended the last two league seasons with a minus goal difference. Moving for Delap just because of a release clause and Wilcox's say-so was a cop-out.",
      "Wilcox should be relieved. He would have been held responsible if Delap was a dud. Delap will get cut a thicker slice of slack at Chelsea, a club that do not generate anywhere near as much scrutiny or criticism as United.",
      "When United relinquished the Premier League title to City in 2012, it was on goal difference. That smarted so sorely for Ferguson that he hijacked City's planned signing of Robin van Persie. Van Persie's goals put the red and white ribbons back on the Premier League trophy.",
      "United have to think similarly, even with their financial limitations."

      "Barring any late snags or hiccups, Matheus Cunha is poised to become Manchester United's first signing of the summer transfer window.",
      "United remain locked in talks with Wolves about how to structure the payments for his £62.5million release clause. Both United and Cunha are keen to get the deal done and there is a growing expectation it will be completed.",
      "If everything goes according to plan, he is expected to slot straight into head coach Ruben Amorim's starting XI and occupy the left-sided No.10 berth. He is well-versed in a wing-back system from his time at Wolves, meaning it should be a seamless transition for the Brazilian.",
      "In Cunha, United are attempting to recruit a luxury player who can make something happen in the blink of an eye. He was a joy to watch at times throughout the 2024/25 campaign and he contributed 17 goals and six assists across all competitions.",
      "United will be hoping he can replicate similar numbers at Old Trafford and increase their attacking output. United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Although his primary responsibility will be to score and create goals, Cunha will be expected to work tirelessly for the team out of possession. Amorim sets exceptionally high demands for his players to adhere to when they do not have the ball, urging them to press as much as possible.",
      "Speaking last December, the United head coach said: \"[It is] impossible to win the Premier League without a team that doesn't run. You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won't win.",
      "\"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won't win. The problem is can they cope with that? If they are used to it in training, they will do it in games.",
      "\"They can improve. You cannot be faster, but you can run more in training. They are professional athletes. Every coach has a different method of pressing.\"",
      "With that in mind, Cunha will have no choice but to alter one particular element of his game. Of the outfield players that played a minimum of 1,800 minutes in the Premier League this season, Cunha spent more time walking around the pitch than anyone else.",
      "Data gathered by Opta shows that Cunha spent 77.1 per cent of his time on the pitch walking. The rest of the Premier League's top five 'walkers', interestingly, were all centre-backs, with the Brazilian being joined at the top of the table by Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk (76.6%), Nottingham Forest's Murillo (74.3%, Ezri Konsa of Aston Villa (74.2% and fellow Forest star Ola Aina (73.8%).",
      "Of course, it can and will be argued that Cunha makes up for that slight downside to his game with his goals and creativity, which is arguably much more important than how quickly he makes his way around the pitch. However, working tirelessly without the ball is a non-negotiable for Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese's call for his players to \"run like mad dogs\" ought to serve as a warning to Cunha and urge him to transform one particular element of his play. If he can improve that, United will inherit an even better player."

      "Osimhen, 26, joined Galatasaray on a season-long loan deal last September after falling out with Napoli boss Antonio Conte and he was considered as something of a coup for the Turkish giant.",
      "Of his 36 goals, 25 of them were netted in the Super Lig, earning Galatasaray a whopping 21 points. Without them, Galatasaray would have surrendered their crown to Jose Mourinho and Fenerbahce, who finished 11 points behind in second.",
      "Many will be quick to suggest that the Turkish Super Lig is not the most challenging of leagues in Europe and has been a dumping ground for Premier League talent in recent years.",
      "Osimhen, though, has established himself as a seasoned goalscorer, scoring 84 goals in the last three seasons for Napoli and Galatasaray combined. He scored 26 goals in Serie A in 2022/23 to deliver Napoli their first league title since 1990.",
      "Prior to moving to Italy in 2020, Osimhen enjoyed a respectable first and only season at French side Lille, scoring 18 times to help them secure a top four finish in Ligue 1.",
      "A consistent source of goals for six seasons, Osimhen has established himself as an elite-level striker. Manchester United considered signing him two summers ago and, regrettably, went for Rasmus Hojlund instead.",
      "Osimhen is well above Hojlund's station and his record in front of goal proves that. He is also four years his senior and has won major honours, including two league titles.",
      "After recording a minus goal deficit in each of the last two Premier League campaigns, United cannot afford to take another gamble on potential this summer, hence why moving for Liam Delap always carried a huge element of risk.",
      "In Osimhen, United would be sourcing a proven goalscorer who has delivered the goods at whatever club he has played for. It is a striker of his calibre they need.",
      "The elephant in the room, of course, is that United cannot offer any prospective signings European football for next season. Osimhen played in the Europa League for Galatasaray this season, scoring six goals, and had played in the Champions League for two consecutive seasons with Napoli prior to that.",
      "However, the Nigerian, who is entering his prime years, has previously outlined his hunger to play in the Premier League, describing it as a \"dream\" back in 2023 - a time when both United and Chelsea were being heavily linked with him.",
      "\"I think playing in one of the top five leagues in the world (Serie A) is an amazing feeling for me,\" Osimhen said in March 2023.",
      "\"A lot of people worldwide consider the Premier League as the best and the strongest league but now I'm in one of the best leagues in the world which is the Italian Serie A.",
      "\"I'm working so hard to make sure that I achieve my dream of playing in the Premier League someday but, like I said, it's a process and I just want to keep on this momentum and continue to do well.\"",
      "With no European football to offer next season, United could find it challenging to attract the level of talent head coach Ruben Amorim craves. However, if Osimhen is still as hungry to play in England, he may be willing to give up European football for a season and make it his mission to take United back to the Champions League.",
      "If United are to swoop for him, he would be signed to spearhead their attack, making him a guaranteed starter.",
      "If United sell Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho this summer, the money raised from those sales would be enough to put a package together to try and land Osimhen.",
      "Signing a proven goalscorer is a non-negotiable for United this summer, and Osimhen can deliver the guarantee of goals they so desperately need."

      "Ruben Amorim made wholesale changes at half-time and Obi replaced Hojlund. Obi is just 17, but he might take Hojlund's role in the first-team squad permanently at this rate.",
      "It's damning for Hojlund that an inexperienced striker, someone who has been described as naive by his own manager, genuinely looks like a bigger goal threat when he comes onto the pitch.",
      "Hojlund looked the same as always against Hong Kong: blunt. He didn't look convincing against the 153rd-ranked national team in the world and took a few heavy touches in the box.",
      "It would be harsh and unfair to heavily scrutinise Hojlund's performance, given these post-season friendlies were arranged at the end of a long campaign, but it certainly wasn't the first time that Obi had replaced him from the bench and looked more capable of finding the back of the net.",
      "Obi was introduced for Hojlund on a few occasions in competitive games this season, and a clear pattern has emerged that suggests the Dane should be doing a lot more up front.",
      "There is no denying that Obi is raw and still has bundles to learn, but his movement in the box is better than Hojlund's and he possesses a knack for goalscoring that his senior peer does not.",
      "Obi's first goal against Hong Kong on Friday afternoon was instinctive, a proper centre-forward strike, and the kind of clinical finish that someone like Gary Lineker built a successful career on.",
      "Then Obi scored another, finding the net with an outstanding header.",
      "Coaches can work with strikers for hours on the training ground. They can oversee different finishing drills. But it sometimes boils down to natural finishing instincts in the box.",
      "Obi still has a long way to go, but he appears to have those killer instincts and his performances from the bench haven't done Hojlund any favours.",
      "Hojlund scored 16 goals in all competitions in his first season in Manchester, which was an impressive haul in his debut campaign, but he spectacularly regressed in his second year at the club.",
      "The Denmark international looked burdened by the weight of leading the attack and he netted just four goals in the Premier League, an unacceptable total for a striker at United.",
      "The jury is out on whether Hojlund will get a third bite of the cherry in 2025/2026. United will sign a new striker this summer and Hojlund could be sold. And the 22-year-old might not even be guaranteed to be ahead of Obi in the pecking order if he remains beyond the transfer window.",
      "United are not expected to send Obi on loan for obvious reasons. The young striker has shown that he can mix it at senior level and he still has bags of untapped potential.",

      "Shortly after Casemiro's goal was disallowed in the fifth minute, he was spotted bickering with Fernandes about something. The pair exchanged a few words and perhaps Fernandes was questioning why the Brazilian was offside.",
      "Casemiro was offside when Fernandes stepped up to take the free-kick and he didn't get back onside quickly enough, which meant his headed goal was chalked off.",
      "It was unnecessary from Casemiro and Fernandes seemed to give him a telling off. That is his responsibility as captain, and there is no standout candidate to inherit the armband if Fernandes signs for Al-Hilal.",

      "There are dozens of reasons to criticise United this season, but the team's performances in post-season friendlies in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong should be completely free of scrutiny.",
      "Hong Kong's manager said United need these games \"like a hole in the head,\" and he was right.",
      "United played 60 competitive games throughout the season, but they still flew halfway around the world after facing Aston Villa, with the purpose of raising roughly £10 million in cash.",
      "The post-season friendlies were arranged for purely commercial reasons. The pitch was also awful in Hong Kong, appearing overgrown, which made it difficult to orchestrate decent play.",

      "Manchester United's hopes of landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo this summer could be reinforced thanks to the help of a former player. The forward has been linked with a big-money move to United and Newcastle after scoring 20 Premier League goals this season.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is desperate for attacking reinforcements this summer. Matheus Cunha is expected to join from Wolves and a new striker is now the priority ahead of the transfer window opening.",
      "Mbeumo has been another attacker linked with a move to Old Trafford and after only being outscored by Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland, the Cameroon international has been tipped to leave Brentford.",
      "Thomas Frank has confirmed that the Londoners will attempt to command the biggest possible fee for Mbeumo after losing Ivan Toney last year. \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" the Bees boss told Tipsbladet. \"It is a lot. Mucho.",
      "\"Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of millions pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him.",
      "\"I would be surprised with what he has to offer. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\"",
      "United are set to rival Newcastle United for the 25-year-old with the Magpies planning for their return to the Champions League. It's believed Brentford have slapped a £50million price tag on the forward but that fee could increase slightly with a bidding war.",
      "Fortunately for United, they have a secret weapon in convincing Mbeumo to move to Manchester. Sergio Reguilon and Mbeumo remain good friends after their short time together in London, the former spent the second half of the 2023/24 season on loan at the club, before he moved to United.",
      "On Friday, the left-back posted an Instagram story of him and Mbeumo posing together at the French Open. \"Happy to see you hermanito *red love heart emoji*,\" the caption read.",
      "Reguilon moved to Old Trafford on loan for the first half of last season before returning to Tottenham in January. He played just 12 games but it didn't stop Reguilon from having nothing but good things to say about the club, words that could appeal to Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has been great to play for Manchester United and I just want to say thank you to the club, the fans and my teammates,\" he said. \"It was a privilege to play for this huge club. I wish all the best for the Red Devils.\"",
      "Mbeumo could even be reunited with Reguilon with reports stating that United could sign the Spaniard this summer. He has been released by Tottenham following the conclusion of the 2024/25 season and United could bring him in to bolster Amorim's wing-back options."

His £30million release clause made him an obtainable target and with United, who are closing in on a £62.5million deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, not flush with cash this summer Delap's price point and quality made him an attractive option.",
      "Instead, United are paying the price for a dismal Premier League campaign and losing the Europa League final earlier this month which ended any hope of European football at Old Trafford next season. Delap seems set to complete his move to Stamford Bridge imminently.",
      "So what next? United are desperate to sign a striker this summer given Rasmus Hojlund's struggles and Joshua Zirkee's preference to play deeper. In an ideal world, Ruben Amorim would be chasing a reunion with Sporting Lisbon powerhouse Viktor Gyokeres, or joining the race for the talented Benjamin Sesko or the free agent Jonathan David. But all three will want Champions league football and United don't have it.",
      "Even the proven top flight alternatives to Delap, the likes of Brentford star Yoane Wissa and Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta could be financially out of reach for United with Premier League signings often attracting a premium.",
      "It means the Reds might have to cast the net further afield in their search for attacking options. And a look at the Bundesliga could provide an answer.",
      "A look down the list of top scorers, which is led by Harry Kane, sees the unheralded Jonathan Burkardt in fourth. The striker hit 18 goals last term to fire Mainz into Europe.",
      "At 24, he has more than 100 senior appearances for Mainz, who often deploy a 3-4-3 shape not dissimilar to Amorim's formation at United, under his belt and has broken into the Germany national side. Indeed, he is a candidate to be starting forward for his country when the 2026 World Cup rolls around next year.",
      "He's long been touted as a potential star in the making in his homeland and is now delivering on that promise.",
      "And the added bonus is he has a reported €20million release clause in his contract. He is attracting interest from Eintracht Frankfurt, who are pushing for a deal, and has only been tentatively linked with United.",
      "But as the Reds seek to strike a balance between the football and financial, Burkardt could be a viable option.",
      "United were woeful in front of in the 2024-25 campaign, but the addition of Cunha as a number 10 will likely improve that tally, while Burkardt is more of a line-leading presence than Hojlund.",
      "The German is far from the perfect solution, but if his price, pedigree and potential allow United to bolster their striker ranks and potentially add new signings elsewhere, he could be a shrewd summer investment."

      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Speaking before the Aston Villa match, Amorim confirmed that Garnacho would still travel on the post-season tour. It's possible that the only reason Garnacho has been included on the trip is to protect his transfer value.",

      "Garnacho could potentially fetch a transfer fee of £70million, but suitors will submit lower offers if they know United want to sell the winger because Amorim wants him out of the door.",
      "That means including Garnacho on the post-season tour and giving him minutes is perhaps a clever ploy to protect his value. Interested clubs, like Napoli and Chelsea, will probably see right through the tactic, but it's better to have Garnacho involved with the first team than frozen out.",
      "It's obviously difficult to sell a player for their market value when a public decision has already been communicated, so Amorim must do what he can to protect his bargaining power.",
      "Garnacho was pictured with a huge smile when the post-season team photo was taken at Manchester Airport, but he didn't look quite so cheery during exchanges with Malaysian fans the day before facing ASEAN All-Stars - it must be added that a long-distance flight and more games after a draining season are enough to leave any player feeling glum.",
      "It's a shame to see Garnacho's time at Old Trafford end on a sour note, if indeed he does leave this summer, but he has crossed managers on too many occasions. Amorim has reiterated he is still a United player, which seems in name only.",

      "Ruben Amorim says the situation with Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho is \"okay\" despite telling the winger he is free to leave the club.",
      "Amorim told Garnacho he could leave United after the Argentine criticised the United head coach's decision to put him on the bench for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last week.",
      "Garnacho was dropped from the United squad for their final game of the Premier League season against Aston Villa on Sunday but he was then included in the travelling squad for their post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.",
      "The 20-year-old played in the second half of United's 1-0 defeat to the ASEAN All Stars on Wednesday night and Garnacho is expected to feature again against a Hong Kong XI on Friday.",
      "\"It’s not a surprise,\" Amorim said of Garnacho's presence in Asia. \"He’s a player of Manchester United, all the players are here. Some players are injured and it was better not to fly here to play these two games so it’s a normal situation. It’s okay.\"",
      "There was anger in Hong Kong last year when Lionel Messi did not participate in an exhibition match between Inter Miami and the national team. Chinese officials cancelled two Argentina friendlies that were scheduled for March 2024 in retaliation over Messi's absence and the fallout dragged on for weeks.",
      "Amorim has promised to give all of the United players game time against Hong Kong. \"Yes, I heard that,\" he said of the Messi affair. \"If they are fit, they will play. We will have the maximum respect for everybody here. We are going to address that.",
      "\"I will think about that when I choose the players to play. We want to use all the young players. We want to balance the team.\"",
      "United were booed by fans in Kuala Lumpur after they lost and failed to score a week on from losing to Spurs by the same scoreline in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim has been in charge of United for more than six months and assumed additional responsibilities due to the prestige of the role. The Hong Kong manager Ashley Westwood said United need a post-season tour \"like a hole in the head\" but Amorim insists United should front up to their domestic and overseas supporters.",
      "\"I think everybody understands that it is a really hard context because we have the season that we have and it is hard in these moments even to face the fans around the world,\" Amorim admitted. \"It is a moment that is hard for us and we want to finish the season.",
      "\"But at the same time we want to give something to the fans. Of course, it is hard to play these games. We have one tour that we are travelling. We don't have time to adapt. Sometimes we are here and we don't have so much time to have contact with the fans to give everything that they deserve.",
      "\"But I think it is clear. We cannot hide that it is really tough in this moment for us not to close the season. But again, if there is one thing that is really important in this club it is that we need to face our fans in this moment and we need to give something to our fans around the world.",
      "\"We want to do that, but sometimes it is really hard for us. Amad is trying to explain, but we were not really focused in the last game and everybody can feel it.",
      "\"But in that moment I understand the fans, I understand the players and we also understand that we want to give something to the fans, but it is hard in this moment. We just want to turn the page.\""

      "Manchester United are set to miss out on the signing of Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap amid his preference to join Chelsea.",
      "United had identified the 22-year-old as an attainable target to strengthen their attacking options ahead of next season after Ipswich's relegation triggered a £30million release clause in his contract.",
      "The former Manchester City youngster, as well as being the subject of interest from United and Chelsea, has also held talks with Everton and Newcastle United recently. He scored 12 Premier League goals this season.",
      "With United now set to miss out on the former Stoke City and Hull City loanee, MEN Sport has picked out five alternatives who the Reds could potentially consider to spearhead their attack.",
      "United have been linked with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo this week, but news of Delap's expected switch to Stamford Bridge could force the Reds to target one of his teammates instead.",
      "Wissa, 28, scored 19 Premier League goals this season, successfully filling the void that had been vacated by Ivan Toney last summer. He led Brentford's attack throughout the season and was only outscored by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23), Erling Haaland (22), Chris Wood (20) and Mbeumo (20) in the Premier League.",
      "The former FC Lorient man also scored 12 times in the Premier League last season, meaning his tally of 32 over the last two seasons means he has netted more top flight goals in that period than Mbeumo, who so often dominates the Brentford headlines.",
      "Establishing himself as a consistent source of goals in the Premier League, Wissa is likely to be a target for a lot of clubs this summer. His contract at the Gtech Community Stadium is up in 2026, but Brentford have the option of an additional year, which they would almost certainly trigger to protect his soaring valuation.",
      "Like Wissa, Mateta is another striker who exceeded expectations for one of the Premier League's mid-table clubs this season, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, of which 14 were netted in the league.",
      "Since initially arriving at Selhurst Park on loan in January 2021, the Frenchman's all-round game has improved, and that has been reflected in his increased attacking output. After scoring 16 goals in the Premier League last season, his tally of 14 this time around demonstrates that he is now an established goal-getter.",
      "Under contract at Palace until 2027, Mateta is excellent at holding the ball up and bringing others into play, meaning he could be an ideal fit for Ruben Amorim's team, where the two No.10s are tasked with operating close to the central striker.",
      "If United decide that Mateta is a realistic alternative to Delap, the problem they could face is that Palace have European football to offer the striker next season after qualifying for the Europa League via their FA Cup triumph at Wembley earlier this month. Being unable to offer European football at Old Trafford could hold United back in their search for a striker.",
      "Strikers of David's pedigree do not come on the market all that often. The fact he is available for free this summer after deciding to leave Lille means that he will be a very attractive option for a number of clubs.",
      "The Canadian spent five years at Lille, scoring 109 goals in 232 appearances, establishing himself as one of Europe's most consistent goalscorers. United have been heavily linked with him in the past and he would be an excellent signing on a free transfer.",
      "However, David played in the Champions League this season and scored seven goals in ten appearances, meaning he will have aspirations of playing in the competition again next season. The likes of Liverpool, Newcastle and Barcelona have all been linked with him and will each play in the Champions League in 2025/26.",
      "It means United are highly unlikely to be able to lure David to M16, even though he would not require a transfer fee. It is when you look at players of his ilk that you begin to grasp a real understanding of just how costly failing to qualify for the Champions League could be.",
      "United have been linked with Osimhen countless times in previous years and now would be as good a time as any to bring him to Old Trafford. He will leave Napoli this summer on a permanent basis after falling out with head coach Antonio Conte almost a year ago.",
      "He spent this season on loan at Turkish side Galatasaray and scored a whopping 36 goals in 40 matches across all competitions. He also racked up eight assists.",
      "Already being linked with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal, United may face a race against the clock to try and lure him to Old Trafford. Some reports have claimed he could be available for around €40m.",
      "In this modern era, a fee in that region for a goalscorer as prolific as Osimhen, who is entering the prime of his career at the age of 26, represents good value. He has scored 84 goals since the beginning of the 2022/23 season for Napoli and Galatasaray combined.",
      "However, a lack of European football could hold United back. He scored six times in seven Europa League appearances this season."

      "Spurs and pointless transfer talk\nI can’t help but think “who can Spurs buy now we have CL?” Which is pointless as we don’t know if we will have the same manager.",
      "That said; with Villa in financial strife and Forest not making the CL those two clubs have four players I would be all over; Gibbs-White, Tielemans, Rodgers and Murillo. Not all of them as they’ll cost a king’s ransom but I can see at least one big names from both sides being snapped up.",
      "Bournemouth aren’t desperate for cash anymore but Semenyo is a terrific player, however if Kerkez does go along with Huijsen then I can’t see a world where they sell their three best players.",
      "Joao Paulinha isn’t enjoying life in Munich, we should be all over a player like that; experienced and durable in that tricky no. 6 role.",

      "",
      "Are promoted clubs really screwed?\nThere’s been a lot of discussion, especially on this website, about how the PL is becoming a closed shop and the gap is widening etc etc. Apparently the 3 promoted clubs are already doomed before they even kick a football!",
      "Personally I think this is all a bit premature and there’s too much reading into a couple of seasons where, frankly, the promoted teams were just poor and barely even gave themselves a chance at staying up.",
      "One of the arguments seems to be that of the other 17 clubs there are no obvious candidates to go down. But I disagree. We could easily have a very open relegation dogfight with any of West Ham, Wolves, Everton, Fulham, Bournemouth, Palace and Brentford all potentially in the mix with the 3 newbies.",
      "Who knows which of those clubs will lose key players and potentially their manager over the Summer. A lot can change from one season to the next. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference. Just look at how Wolves were transformed when they replaced their manager. What if they lose Pereira and make a bad decision in appointing his successor?",
      "If you look back to the 22/23 season, the 3 relegated clubs finished 8th, 15th and 17th the previous season. Did anyone really see Leicester getting relegated that season? Not many, I imagine. Southampton went down after 12 consecutive seasons in the Prem and were not widely tipped to be relegated that season.",
      "And fundamentally it comes down to how well the promoted clubs prepare themselves. When my team Brentford came up, we added a few new faces but most of the promotion-winning squad remained intact. It was a long term plan coming together because we were (and are) an extremely well-managed club. Same with Brighton. Same with Bournemouth. Same with Fulham.",
      "So I really don’t agree it’s a closed shop. Is it tough to get promoted and stay in the PL? Absolutely. But why shouldn’t it be? In terms of depth, it’s the strongest league in the world, by a distance. But if clubs come up with no real vision and either just hope for the best or think throwing some money at players with little strategy will keep them up, they shouldn’t be surprised if they end up struggling. And they shouldn’t be blaming the Premier League for that.\nRob, Surrey, Bees fan",

      "Barcelona could make an offer for an Arsenal star if they fail to land Marcus Rashford from Man Utd this summer, according to reports.",
      "The Catalan giants are desperate to improve the left side of their attack ahead of next season with the hope they can provide competition and cover for Raphinha.",
      "Barcelona have been linked with Man Utd forward Rashford – who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa – and Liverpool winger Luis Diaz.",
      "And Barca sporting director Deco admitted earlier this month that Diaz and Rashford are two players that the La Liga side are looking at.",
      "Speaking to RAC1, Deco said: “Talking about players who have contracts with other clubs is complicated out of respect. We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players. When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team.",
      "“Our big priority is to strengthen what we have at home, renewals of Pedri, Gavi, Araujo, Raphinha, Kounde… I understand that when people talk about signings, they always think about players coming from abroad, but for me, renewals are also signings. Lamine is the best signing in history.",
      "READ: Henry inclusion in ranking of Arsenal’s last nine No.9 signings illustrates Sesko desperation",
      "“Then, if the team can be improved. From what we’ve seen this season, we need a player with a different profile to what we have to help the strikers. Fermín has played as a winger and has done well. The composition of the squad also depends on the market.”",
      "A deal for Rashford or Diaz will be expensive for Barcelona to complete with the Catalan giants still sorting their finances out after years of struggles.",
      "And now Spanish publication Sport claims that Barcelona’s ‘plan is to try a loan’ for Man Utd forward Rashford as the La Liga outfit ‘aren’t willing to shell out the roughly €40 million the Red Devils are asking for.’",
      "It is understood that ‘if such a large investment were needed, the club would first invest in Luis Diaz or even someone else’ but Man Utd ‘are refusing to negotiate anything other than a transfer’.",

      "The report adds that ‘if the financial situation continues to prevent the transfer of Luis Díaz or the possibility of reaching an agreement with United for the loan of Rashford, the club will activate other interesting names in its attempt to strengthen the left flank of the attack.’",
      "It is claimed that those names are Arsenal star Martinelli and Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman as they are both ‘suitable’ profiles.",

      "Brown told Football Insider: “Arsenal are prepared to let Martinelli go. His form has been very up and down, and they’re not 100 per cent satisfied with what he offers.",
      "“Some Saudi clubs have been looking at him, and if they come in with a bid that Arsenal deem acceptable, I don’t think they’ll stand in his way.",
      "“But it will come down to whether they can bring in a replacement for him. If they decide to let him leave, they’ll already be working on signing somebody else in his position.",

      "Here are 10 individuals prompting dips in the Premier League shame well.",
      "",
      "Vitinha\nWolves fans can take some solace in the fact that if Vitinha had been putting in anything like the sort of performances he is for Paris Saint-Germain right now in his season at Molineux, he would be bound for brighter things anyway.",
      "But we assume there’s a certain amount of regret on the part of the Wolves chiefs that Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t give him the chance to prove himself worthy of the £17m required to make his loan move from Porto permanent in the summer of 2021 given he’s now valued at £50m by Transfermarkt and a helluva lot more by PSG, who have every right to claim they have the best central midfielder on the planet right now.",
      "",
      "Luis Enrique\nHe was the betting favourite to take over at Arsenal in 2018, but the board plumped for Unai Emery to replace Arsene Wenger as they felt Enrique was both too expensive and too ‘self-absorbed’ after coaching Barcelona to a Treble.",

      "And if it wasn’t for a winter World Cup, Enrique may currently be in charge of Manchester United, or at least would have been for a time…",
      "",
      "Yann Sommer\nSommer was very high on Manchester United’s shortlist to replace David De Gea in the summer of 2023, and although Bayern Munich swooped in the January window to ruin the Red Devils’ chances of a free transfer, it was Inter who then took advantage of a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with the Bundesliga club to secure his £6m signing as a replacement for the guy United bought for £44m as their new No.1.",
      "And while Sommer has played a vital role in securing Inter’s place in the Champions League final, pulling off several remarkable saves in the knockout stages, United got to the Europa League final in spite of Andre Onana, who then definitely could have done better to deny Brennan Johnson his winning goal for Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Matteo Darmian\nLike you might thank an unattractive ex-girlfriend for dumping you as you stand next to your perfect wife, reflecting on his four-season career break at Old Trafford having helped Inter to the Champions League final in 2023, Darmian said: “I have to say thank you to them [United] because if I’m the player and person that I am, it’s also because of them.”",

      "Mkhitaryan counts as another misstep, but his imminent part in a second Champions League final is more embarrassing for Arsenal, who bought him for the price of an Alexis Sanchez after 18 inauspicious months at Old Trafford ahead of similar humdrum displays at the Emirates before he left for Serie A on a free transfer in 2020.",
      "",
      "Ousmane Dembele\nThere’s no specific club-shaming here, but pretty much all of the big boys have been linked with Dembele at some point over the last five years or so – Arsenal in a swap deal with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang perhaps the most notable – and we’re guessing the bigwigs were of a similar mind to the rest of us in thinking they needed to steer clear of a Fancy Dan who was destined to never reach a full potential that he has now realised in spectacular fashion during a 33-goal, 13-assist season for PSG.",

      "We were stifling chuckles even as United’s interest came to light, which we couldn’t contain after hearing it was the former Stoke and West Ham striker who told them where to go rather the Red Devils backing out of what was being described as a ‘PR disaster’ signing.",

      "United’s favourite target for a while looked to be Ipswich’s Delap. They were among a host of Premier League sides who were willing to pay his £30million release clause, and it was even suggested they’d broadly agreed personal terms with his entourage, waiting for the green light from the striker himself.",
      "However, multiple outlets have stated Delap has instead agreed to sign with Chelsea, and GIVEMESPORT states that after United were ‘unable to convince’ him to sign, they will move onto ‘alternative options’.",

      "It is believed it would cost £35million for PSG to sell the Frenchman. But it’s said the preference at Old Trafford would be to land a striker who is already experienced in the Premier League.",

      "Paul Ince has revealed his opinion that an expensive Manchester United forward is “not ready” to play for the club as he feels they should allow him to leave and “find his feet.”",
      "United have some catching up to do in the Premier League. They finished 15th in the season just gone – their worst finish in the history of the competition.",
      "They will reportedly soon confirm the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, for £62.5million. The Red Devils will hope that the Brazilian fares better than other recent expensive attackers.",
      "Two years ago, United signed Rasmus Hojlund for £72million from Atalanta, and in 52 games in all competitions in his second campaign, he scored just 10 goals.",
      "Former United man Ince doesn’t feel he’s the right man yet for the club, and should be allowed to leave for a period in order to get his career back on track.",
      "“I feel sorry for Hojlund, because he’s not ready yet to play for Manchester United, he’s been thrown in the deep end. He needs that senior striker to take that weight off of him,” Ince said on talkSPORT.",
      "“I wouldn’t be averse to him going on loan for six months, to score goals, find his feet, and get a bit of confidence. People don’t understand that when you play for Manchester United, it’s about the mentality and dealing with the expectations.”",
      "Many believed United were overpaying for Hojlund, as he’d played a single season at Atalanta prior to heading to Old Trafford, in which he scored just 10 goals.",
      "The season just gone has shown that he has clearly not made the jump that United hopes he might, and that could lead to a transfer away.",
      "It’s believed one of the club’s directors has flown to Naples for a meeting with Napoli over a potential swap deal between Hojlund and Victor Osimhen.",
      "Interest from Inter Milan has also been reported for the Danish striker, so a return to Italy, where he played prior to United, looks the most likely course of action.",
      "Paul Parker feels a permanent transfer away would be best for Hojlund, as he has stated: “Rasmus Hojlund has to leave Manchester United for the sake of his own career. He needs a change of environment. Old Trafford chiefs will have to think about moving on Mason Mount too, he’s not athletic enough.",
      "“Ruben Amorim needs someone to play behind the centre forward, Man Utd have no player who runs beyond and that’s one of the things that might have helped Hojlund if he had someone who’d run to create more space for him.”",
      "A former Manchester United star has revealed his main ‘fear’ with Ruben Amorim as the ‘jury is out’ on the under-fire Red Devils head coach.",
      "Man Utd duo Rasmus Hojlund and Mason Mount need to leave Old Trafford this summer to rescue their careers, according to ex-Red Devils defender Paul Parker.",

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "The latest reports indicate that Barcelona will sign Rashford on loan next season.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Any Saudi Pro League club\nWe simply can’t see it. Surely even a reconciliation at Manchester United would be better than the desert.",
      "",
      "4=) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – they are bound for the Europa League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4=) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – were said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6=) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "6=) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "6=) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but they sneaked back into the Champions League, so they could be an option.",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. And they surely become an option again after reaching the Champions League.",

      "",
      "32) 2003 – Juventus 0-0 Milan (2-3 on penalties)\nIt might seem reductive to consider the only goalless Champions League final as the worst, but the 2003 edition truly was a slog. It wasn’t without its moments – Andriy Shevchenko’s cruelly disallowed goal, Antonio Conte hitting the post and Andrea Pirlo striking the bar – but that second half in particular was a test of spectator endurance more than anything.",
      "Their Serie A meetings that season ended in a 2-1 win apiece but Old Trafford was treated to nothing of the sort. Even half the penalties were missed in the shootout as Dida ventured ever so slightly off his line.",
      "",
      "31) 2004 – Monaco 0-3 Porto\nTo prove that goals do not necessarily equate to a pulsating game, watch the 2004 Champions League final and retain your consciousness for the full 90 minutes. An audience not quite anaesthetised to the stylings of Jose Mourinho found that the novelty of two surprise success stories had worn off long before full-time as the Portuguese starved the occasion of any intrigue.",
      "Monaco failed to muster a single shot on target; Porto themselves only managed four as they registered less than 50% possession.",
      "",
      "30) 2010 – Bayern Munich 0-2 Inter Milan\nAs the BBC said at the time, it ‘might not have been one for the purists’. Mourinho was once at great pains to point out that he couldn’t properly empathise with Tottenham upon his appointment as manager in November 2019 because “I never lost a Champions League final”. This was a fine example as to why, as Inter channelled the determination and resilience of their semi-final victory over Barcelona to secure a remarkable Treble in unexceptional circumstances.",
      "It was also the first European Cup final to be moved back from a Wednesday to a Saturday, which remains one of the great first-world injustices of our time.",
      "",
      "29) 1993 – Marseille 1-0 Milan\nUEFA would perhaps rather the world forgot about the winner of its first revamped Champions League; the rest of the world would happily forget the final itself. Marseille reached it amid claims of corruption, bribery and much worse, while Milan boasted a side containing Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Gianluigi Lentini and Marco van Basten in his final game ever. They were kept at bay by Fabian Barthez, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli, who scored the only goal shortly before half-time.",
      "",
      "28) 1996 – Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 on penalties)\nA similarly sketchy final in hindsight again undeniably pitted the continent’s two best sides against one another, but the subsequent game was less than the sum of its numerous parts. Goalscorers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Jari Litmanen – both of whom capitalised on goalkeeping mistakes – would experience varying Premier League careers thereafter but even the former would struggle to conjure many memories besides his opener and lifting the trophy.",
      "",
      "27) 2021 – Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea\nWhile 19 points separated the two teams in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola helped bridge that chasm by turning his nose up at the idea of playing a holding midfielder. Thomas Tuchel welcomed the unexpected olive branch and a year after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat in the final with Paris Saint-Germain, the German engineered victory by the same scoreline thanks to Kai Havertz. But even Chelsea supporters would admit it was no classic.",
      "",
      "26) 2001 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 on penalties)\nThe all-penalty final saw Gaizka Mendieta and Steffan Effenberg trade spot-kicks in normal time, with Santiago Canizares saving from Mehmet Scholl, before Bayern triumphed in an eventual shootout. There were 28 shots so attacking football was not in particularly short order, but only goalkeeping fetishists would have truly enjoyed themselves.",
      "",
      "25) 2019 – Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool\nAn early goal can do one of two things to a match with such high stakes: galvanise the team that concedes and lead to a pulsating game; or encourage the scorers to become more defensive, resolute and frustrating as they seek to protect their advantage. The 2019 Champions League final was a prime example of the latter.",
      "Mo Salah put Liverpool in front in the second minute and while Tottenham were the better side thereafter, they never really recovered to the point where they threatened to equalise. Divock Origi provided the last slice of bread to a fairly mediocre sandwich just before the final whistle.",
      "After the ridiculous drama of the respective semi-finals, this was perhaps an understandable anti-climax and a case of the result being so very much more important than the performance.",
      "",
      "24) 2022 – Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid\nThis final, moved to Paris from St Petersburg, is remembered most for the shambles which unfolded outside the Stade de France and the shameful cover-up that followed. On the pitch, it was the Thibaut Courtois final, with the Real Madrid keeper using his Mr Tickle arms to great effect, repelling everything Liverpool threw at him. After Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike, the belief slowly drained from the Reds with each stop Courtois made.",
      "",
      "23) 2000 – Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\nThat both finalists came from the same country for the first time in European Cup history did not help the first showpiece of the new millennium. Real Madrid actually finished lower than Valencia in La Liga – fifth to third – but the nature of the destruction gave it an air of a typical domestic meeting rather than the biggest match of the season. Steve McManaman’s volley was lovely, mind.",
      "",
      "22) 2023 – Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\nThe expectation was perhaps this would be a poor final because it was such a mis-match between the best team in Europe and the third-best team in Italy, but the reality was that Inter did an excellent job of disrupting City, who rarely got into their stride. Rodri scored a belter but City barely bothered the Italians otherwise, and they found Ederson to be a stubborn opponent themselves. The result was historic but few will remember the game.",
      "",
      "21) 2007 – Milan 2-1 Liverpool\nA final can sometimes suffer for its lack of freshness. Milan and Liverpool, of course, had the unenviable task of living up to their incredible clash of just two years prior; they never really stood a chance. The three goals were little more than ordinary and partial Dani Alves alternative Jermaine Pennant was probably the best player, for Christ’s sake.",
      "",
      "20) 2017 – Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid\nMario Mandzukic’s equaliser, one of the three greatest goals in Champions League final history, deserved so much more. Juventus were primed to deliver as much as late as the hour mark as they were still level, but they simply could not keep up as Real feigned to help The Old Lady cross the road before pushing them into onrushing traffic.",
      "",
      "19) 2009 – Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United\nThere goes that curse of the early goal again, the bane of many a neutral. Samuel Eto’o scored in the tenth minute and Lionel Messi the 70th as a ludicrous Barcelona side were just a level or two beyond Manchester United, who had just one shot on target in each half.",
      "",
      "18) 1998 – Juventus 0-1 Real Madrid\n“The 1998 Champions League final was possibly the most important game in Real Madrid’s history,” winning captain Manolo Sanchis once suggested, their 32-year wait to be crowned European champions finally coming to an end in Amsterdam. It was an incredible moment, but a fairly ordinary game.",

      "17) 2016 – Real Madrid 1-1 Atletico Madrid (5-3 on penalties)\nIn terms of grit and battle, 2016 offered up precisely what one might expect from a Madrid derby helmed by Zinedine Zidane and Diego Simeone. A total of 42 shots and 34 fouls made for a titanic tussle that Real eventually edged in a shootout.",
      "",
      "16) 2020 – PSG 0-1 Bayern Munich \nThe only final played behind closed doors when Covid was acting the d*** could have been a drab affair in the absence of fans but PSG and Bayern put on a decent spectacle in Lisbon. Both sides had good chances in the first half, with PSG desperate for their first European crown, but Bayern’s Champions League know-how told when Kingsley Coman headed in a winner on the hour before the Germans absorbed everything Mbappe and co. could throw at them.",
      "",
      "15) 2024 – Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Real Madrid\nAnother final in which the predicted procession did an immense disservice to the underdogs and exposed the favourites. Dortmund were as excellent as Real were poor in the first half and the Germans really should have led. Karim Adeyemi will forever be replaying that chance when put through on goal.",
      "But Real weathered that storm and their individual quality eventually told as Vinicius Junior carried them further into this era of dominance.",
      "",
      "14) 1995 – Ajax 1-0 Milan\nThe absolute state of those teams. Edwin van der Sar, Danny Blind, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Frank de Boer, Alessandro Costacurta, Clarence Seedorf, Marcel Desailly, Edgar Davids, Ronald de Boer, Zvonimir Boban, Jari Litmanen, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert. With two managerial legends in Louis van Gaal and Fabio Capello filling the dugouts, there might never have been a more stacked final in terms of talent. The game itself was no less captivating.",
      "",
      "13) 2015 – Juventus 1-3 Barcelona\n“Spectacular” was the word Luis Enrique used to describe Barcelona’s win over Juventus in the 2015 Champions League final. History is written by the victors, of course, but it seems a generous interpretation. Not that it wasn’t an excellent game: the continent’s best defence gave a supreme attack quite the scare before eventually succumbing to defeat.",
      "",
      "12) 2018 – Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\nStarved of possibly its best player after half an hour, the 2018 Champions League final did not provide quite the pulsating mesh of styles it had promised. Liverpool were understandably subdued and Real plodded through large portions before the rest was largely lost in a cloud of goalkeeping embarrassment.",
      "",
      "11) 2011 – Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United\nAs far as exhibitions go, they don’t come much better. But there was always a sense of Barcelona and Manchester United being a bit of a mismatch, even when Wayne Rooney equalised after half an hour. Lionel Messi and David Villa had secured a third European Cup in six seasons before Sir Alex Ferguson knew what hit him, while Rooney was left begging for mercy.",
      "",
      "10) 2012 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (3-4 on penalties)\nThe late drama of two goals in the final seven minutes went some way to undoing the relative monotony of the preceding 80 or so. It does, however, remain hilarious that Bayern Munich had 20 corners and failed to score from any, while Chelsea had only one and managed to rescue themselves with it.",
      "",
      "9) 2002 – Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid\nWere it not for an injury to starting goalkeeper Cesar, facilitating the introduction of Iker Casillas, an iconic moment in Champions League history might have been lost to the ether. As it was, Casillas made a string of impressive saves to preserve the lead Zinedine Zidane granted Los Blancos in spectacular fashion at Hampden Park. Few expected Leverkusen to make it so far but no-one could claim they didn’t contribute to a great game.",
      "",
      "8) 2006 – Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\nWhile an early sending-off can so often inhibit a team and a spectacle, Arsenal seemed invigorated by the dismissal of Jens Lehmann in Paris in 2006. They took the lead through Sol Campbell and were 15 minutes from unthinkable glory before Henrik Larsson rewrote the script as only he could.",
      "",
      "7) 1999 – Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich\nWhen we finally drain the well of unoriginal content ideas and come to rank the greatest two-minute spells in Champions League history, Manchester United’s stoppage-time exploits against Bayern Munich in 1999 might well fare better. But there is a reason the Wikipedia summary of the first and second halves at the Nou Camp are offered as many paragraphs – three – as the entirety of injury-time.",
      "",
      "6) 2013 – Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich\nAfter their two Bundesliga meetings ended in 1-1 draws, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich did battle at Wembley to settle the matter beyond all doubt. Jurgen Klopp side started far better but fell behind after an hour, only to equalise eight minutes later. Arjen Robben then scored the winner in the penultimate minute to conclude an even and excellent game.",
      "",
      "5) 2014 – Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (after extra-time)\nWhen one team so obviously prepares for 90 minutes, the unexpected and sudden addition of 30 more can lead to something of a damp squib. Atletico Madrid led for almost an hour before Sergio Ramos’ last-gasp equaliser, at which point Diego Simeone’s side was drained both mentally and physically and bereft of substitutions. Extra-time was an exercise in brutality; it had become difficult to watch by the time Cristiano Ronaldo was baring his triumphant, flabby chest.",

Milan were without a number of injured and suspended players but ruthlessly dismantled Barcelona all the same. It just would have been nice if the Spaniards had turned up.",

      "3) 2008 – Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea\nSome continental meetings between two teams from the same nation suffer for familiarity. The 2008 Champions League final was the antidote to that particular poison, as Manchester United and Chelsea freely traded blows like super-heavyweights knowing this would be their defining bout. Cristiano Ronaldo landed the first blow, only to be floored by Frank Lampard. The dismissal of Didier Drogba in extra-time might even have inadvertently decided the destination of the cup, as John Terry slipped 12 yards from glory before Edwin van der Sar kept out Nicolas Anelka.",

      "2) 1997 – Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus\nThe biggest surprise in Champions League final history benefited from an unexpected winner toppling a European superpower, a two-goal salvo from the uncelebrated Karl-Heinz Riedle, an understated backheel goal from Alessandro Del Piero and one of the finest examples of man-marking in the sport’s history as Paul Lambert shadowed Zinedine Zidane throughout.

      "“It’s still Ten Hag’s team which was built for a different style, so now you’re seeing what happens when you play people out of position or in a system that many of them aren’t comfortable.",
      "“But my fear is whether he can make that formation work in any case. United have never played three at the back in their history, and apart from Inter, all the best teams in the world play with that back four.",
      "“With a lot of that current squad, we’re not talking about bad players. Some of these players earn a lot of money, and regardless of the formation, they have to be playing at a level higher than they are right now. To be fifth from the bottom is absolutely disastrous.",
      "“They put all their eggs in one basket in terms of winning the Europa League and that performance was absolutely pathetic. Fans can understand performances dropping in the weeks before the final, but you have to show up, and they were diabolical. So the jury still has to be out.”",
      "Ince has also hit out at Man Utd’s board as they should have been in the ‘race” to sign two Liverpool stars.",

      "Liam Delap choosing Chelsea is a massive blow for Manchester United – much more damaging than it would have been for the Blues had the 22-year-old snubbed them in favour of the Red Devils.",
      "Chelsea are an attractive club to play for right now; Manchester United are not. It’s not Delap or bust for Chelsea, but that feels very much the case for United.",
      "Delap was perfect: young; cheap; scores Premier League goals. And crucially, while United are terrible, they are definitely better than Ipswich.",
      "Not only do they not have European football as a draw, there’s also no light at the end of a tunnel which has grown longer under Ruben Amorim thanks to a philosophy and system almost laughably unsuited to the players in his squad. Any striker joining United this summer will wonder how long a contract might need to be for them to see a semblance of success at Old Trafford.",
      "History, a fading assumption that things must get better at Manchester United because This Is Manchester United and a promise of game time are about the only selling points Amorim and his recruitment team can use to lure players to the club this summer.",
      "That won’t be enough for Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike or other top-level goalscorers United would previously have been vying to sign, and our struggle to come up with these seven striker options – most of whom still feel like unlikely additions for various reasons – shows just how bleak things are for Amorim in the search for anyone who can put the ball in the back of the net.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nNaming United’s director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves along with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and sporting director Giovanni Manna in a report claiming a meeting has been held in Naples to discuss a swap deal for Osimhen adds a level of credence to a rumour we would otherwise have dismissed out of hand. Kudos to the reporter for their commitment to the clicks if it is indeed nonsense.",
      "Osimhen is a world-class striker who’s scored 36 goals on loan at Galatasaray this term and 100 goals in his last four seasons. He’s in that top rung of goalscorers currently available for transfer. And weirdly, despite being very available – Napoli are desperate to get rid of him with his contract expiring at the end of next season – there appears to be scant competition to sign him.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool have turned their noses up for some reason, Paris Saint-Germain are no longer keen and even Chelsea appear to have gone off the idea of signing a brilliant 26-year-old striker for £65m on £200,000-per-week wages. Sounds good to us.",
      "And amid reports that, unlike other top strikers, Osimhen isn’t all that bothered about Champions League football, we wonder if the Nigerian doesn’t have something of a chip on his shoulder…a burning desire to prove doubters wrong.",
      "He can find a kindred spirit in that pursuit at Old Trafford in Amorim, and we’re sure (actually we’re not, but we hope) Osimhen would rather be scoring Premier League goals, even for Manchester United, than Saudi Pro League goals for whichever PIF club offers him a billion pounds a year to play in front of tens of people.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nWe love him and really don’t want him, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton or anyone else to leave Palace ahead of their Europa League campaign as Oliver Glasner – having already won it once before with Frankfurt – could do something really rather special with this group if he can keep them together.",
      "Reports suggesting Mateta is open to a move as he looks to catch Didier Deschamps’ eye ahead of the World Cup in 2026 begs the question as to whether he’s more likely to do that by staying at Palace and playing in Europe or through moving to Old Trafford. We’re leaning towards the latter as for better or worse, Deschamps – like everyone else – will be very aware of what Mateta is doing if he becomes United’s new No.9.",
      "He could be great as well. He’s what Rasmus Hojlund should be – a bully who holds the ball up well with a decent touch, brings playmakers into the game, runs in behind and gets on the end of crosses. Another significant boon for Amorim is that Mateta has thrived for Palace in the 3-4-3 formation he is trying to make work at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nAnyone not watching Villa week in, week out, and actually a fair few who have, would claim this was something of a fallow season for Watkins. A fair point compared to last term perhaps, but a Premier League return of 16 goals and eight assists meant only four players – Mohamed Salah (47), Alexander Isak (29), Bryan Mbeumo (27) and Erling Haaland (25) – finished the campaign with more goal contributions than the 29-year-old, in what was his second-best top-flight season in that regard.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team made a point of not wanting to sign players over the age of 25 when they took charge of football operations, in a bid to ensure their market values at least had a chance of increasing in their time at the club, rather than fading to nothing as has been the case for pretty much everyone signed in the last decade.",
      "The England international would have to hit the ground running and score goals at a fair lick to avoid his value dropping as he turns 30 in December, but needs must and United just need to find someone, anyone who can lead the line – as Watkins has done very, very well for Villa under Unai Emery – and score goals.",
      "",
      "Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen)\nHis age (29) is about the only stick you can beat Schick with given his schtick this season has been scoring more Bundesliga goals (21) than anyone but Serhou Guirassy (also 21) and Harry Kane (26).",

He’s done plenty to suggest he’s not cut out for it. And yet… he is a very talented footballer – ‘there’s a player in there’ as they say.",
      "But while that player could perhaps be uncovered at Liverpool or another stable football club, Manchester United are not in a position to be lifting a footballer from a slump, while a move to Old Trafford will almost certainly see Nkunku scrabbling on his hands and knees at the cloying soil at the base of the hole he finds himself to find the rocks at the very bottom.",

      "Kean scored 19 Serie A goals this season, behind on Mateo Retegui (25), including braces against Roma and Inter, and goals against Juventus, Atalanta and AC Milan.",
      "He has a €52m [£44m] release clause, which feels reasonable, and may well feel as though he has unfinished business in the Premier League.",

      "He’s 24, a Germany international, has frequently played in a 3-4-3 and has a release clause of just €20m [£17m]. The not insignificant issue for United is that Frankfurt have supposedly made Burkardt their top target if Ekitike gets poached by one of the big boys, and they can offer him Champions League football. But United should absolutely be looking into this one at the very least.",

      "However, the lack of European football next year means United are at the bottom of a six foot hole waiting for the dirt to be piled on. Two seasons out of European football and we might actually see United go bankrupt. Summer will be a rough time, gamble and let Amorim spend in the hope they’ll make the Champions League and keep the wolves at bay but also ensure the death of the club if they don’t.",

      "United are about to sign Cunha. He has 15 goals and six assists last season v Bruno’s 8 goals and 11 assists. Cunha played 3 fewer games. So Cunha could replace Bruno’s attacking output, at least in terms of goal involvements, if not in terms of creating chances for our non-existent strikers.",
      "There is also an argument that United would be better without Bruno because he gives the ball away so much. This could be said to have cost us in the Europa League final in which he was otherwise anonymous (despite getting a Whoscored rating of 7.39). I always think he’s United’s Steven Gerrard but is he in fact our Coutinho?",
      "Selling Bruno would provide significant funds – not selling for less than £100M, which would be almost pure profit – which we could invest wisely in 2/3 young players for big needs within the squad.",
      "Now, having said all that with a straight face, United should not entertain Bruno’s sale this summer (unless silly money is offered – £150M plus) for three reasons:",
      "1) Hes our best player and one of only four players in their prime we can rely (possibly five with Cunha coming in)",
      "2) There’s no guarantee anyone will replace his contribution – even Cunha is outscoring his xG massively already so a regression to the mean will mean a drop in his output.",
      "3) I don’t trust United to replace him",
      "Bruno plus Cunha means United score more goals next year, even without a striker. No Bruno leaves us where we are with no guarantee that anyone in the team is going to replace his output. We wouldn’t even be able to spend the money on the quality of player that could guarantee replacing his output because they all want to play in the Champions League and not for a team that trades on its history rather than the quality on the pitch.",

It won’t mean anything to the club, but fans (those who did attend – it was half full in KL) have saved up for this for months, so you can imagine that being beaten by a team that technically does not exist is far from amusing for them.",

I’m a Liverpool fan but even I found parts of it to be utterly preposterous, though.",

      "To his great discredit, Ed has decided to somehow repeat this mistake like-for-like, and is now trying to convince himself that this moment is “a near unique opportunity” to “start a dynasty” and “rival even the Real Madrids of this world”. It’s a baffling lack of perspective/awareness from someone who began by acknowledging a previous lack of perspective/awareness.",
      "FSG have owned and operated the club for 15 years now. They have an established track record of making excellent, if financially conservative, decisions. They have stated repeatedly from the beginning in 2010 that they would operate the club within its own means, and that they would always reinvest any money generated by the club into itself. They have lived up to this promise and delivered more than I had ever dared hope Liverpool would achieve in a football landscape competing with the likes of City/Chelsea/PSG/Newcastle/Chinese-clubs-10-years-ago/Saudi-clubs-2-years-ago. They brought in Suarez, they brought in Allison and Virgil, they offered 120m for Felipe Caicedo, they are working on major deals this summer.",
      "FSG does not reinvest the club’s money into itself each and every year, though; the money is sometimes rolled over to future windows, and this upsets a lot of fans. These fans have either missed the fact that LFC has won two league titles in 35 years and both came in seasons when the club did basically nothing in the transfer window, or they simply care more about transfers than they do about effective football club management, who knows.",
      "It was always a mistake to interpret FSG’s general fiscal conservatism as a lack of ambition from club management/ownership, or as a sign of greed/them taking money out of the club. But it is also a mistake to interpret FSG loosening the purse strings for opportunistic luxury purchases like Suarez/Allison/Caicedo/Wirtz as the start of an era of Scouse Galacticos, rather than exceptions to the rule/approach which has served LFC so well over the last 15 years and will hopefully continue to see us with a club that we can be wholly proud to support.\nOliver (sidenote: if City’s FFP/PSR charges are confirmed, we could have already been talking about an FSG-led LFC dynasty in English football) Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland",

      "Chelsea were not in the Conference League because they qualified for the Europa League but Man Utd winning the FA Cup put them in there instead, but they did put themselves in a position to qualify for the Europa League and were then shifted to the Conference League due to Utd’s FA Cup win because ‘them’s the rules’.",
      "Having said all that, I would love Arsenal to win any European trophy as it might shut Stewie Griffin up (it wouldn’t) and although, unlike some ‘supporters, I don’t see winning trophies as the be all and end all (it is possible to just enjoy football for the game that it is) it is very enjoyable.",

      "Firstly, let’s look at Arsenal. Three consecutive years (four, if you count the collapsed bid for Champions League football in 2022) of coming up short with largely the same group of players. This season has given us strong hints it is starting to take its toll.",
      "If they couldn’t deal with the pressure of the last few years, how is it going to be in this coming season – the 5th proper year of the Arteta project – where the expectations now shift from HOPING to EXPECTING to win a trophy? They’ll probably get that striker they need, but it won’t be the cure for all ills. They still lack squad depth. They still lack knowhow at the business end of the season. And Arteta doesn’t help with his paranoia and touchline histrionics.",
      "No, for me, this feels like a club coming to the end game of a project, not the start. Liverpool and Man City will definitely finish above them next year.",
      "And so, to Chelsea. Back in the Champions League, and with that winning feeling from bagging the Conference League. And now, this afternoon, news is coming through they’re grabbing Delap from under the noses of Manchester United (lol, by the way) which surely represents an upgrade on the erratic Jackson.",
      "If they can now get a decent goalkeeper and a dominant centre back to supplement the quality of James, Cucurella, Enzo, Caicedo, Lavia, Palmer and (presumably) Delap, then you’re looking at a side that can surely only be heading in one direction and that is upwards. It’s easy to scoff at Chelsea these last few years – and a lot of it has been entirely justified – but you just get a feeling that something might just be starting to take off at long last.",
      "Please feel free to chuck this back in my face if Arsenal are 10 points clear at Christmas and Chelsea are looking like they fancy a return to Conference League football – but I’m confident that you’ll see a changing of the guard in London next season.\nAndy H, Swansea",

I was thrilled. It felt great.",

      "Report as Man Utd beaten by ASEAN All-Stars in first friendly of post-season tour; Harry Maguire, Andre Onana, Patrick Dorgu, Casemiro, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad Diallo all featured for Ruben Amorim's side",
      "Thursday 29 May 2025 11:07, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim admitted his side may \"need the boos\"  after they suffered a 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in the first fixture of their post-season tour.",
      "Harry Maguire captained the side as first-teamers Casemiro, Patrick Dorgu, Andre Onana, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund all started for United in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Jonny Evans and Amad Diallo were among 11 changes at half-time with the score locked at 0-0, but Maung Maung Lwin netted a 71st-minute winner for the South-East Asia XI to inflict another defeat on Amorim's struggling side.",
      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe. Because every game we lost in the Premier League, they [fans] were always there [supporting].",
      "\"It's like the way of playing, if they see that it's not working, they will change the way they behave. But I felt when we finished and walked away, the supporters were with us. But, again, let's wait for the next season.\"",
      "Amorim described United's season as \"disastrous\" after they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost to Tottenham in the Europa League final - and their poor form continued at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "Garnacho played the entire second half amid doubts over his future at the club, as did Fernandes, who has attracted interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "A host of academy youngsters were given minutes which will be seen as the only positive from the defeat in front of a crowd of 72,550, more than 6,000 miles away from Old Trafford.",
      "United will play another friendly in Hong Kong on Friday for their final fixture of the tour which is reportedly set to earn the club £8m.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada said before the friendly defeat that United will balance \"ambition\" with the need to be \"prudent\" in the transfer market.",
      "United's defeat to Spurs meant they missed out on silverware and Champions League qualification worth an estimated £100m, and the club have wasted little time trying to improve Amorim's side with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha set to sign.",
      "It could start a busy summer in terms of incomings and outgoings at Old Trafford, with chief executive Berrada confident about United's plans.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say that we've been planning for many months now,\" he told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios, so now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve, so (technical director) Jason (Wilcox), his team, Ruben have been in talks for many months.",
      "\"Now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent but at the same time with ambition.\"",
      "United's defeat in Malaysia came a week to the day since their Europa League final loss in Spain and just three days on from beating Aston Villa 2-0 in their Premier League finale at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim told fans that \"the good days are coming\" as the head coach apologised for a wretched campaign during an impassioned end-of-season address.",
      "United chief executive Berrada said: \"Ruben spoke really well on Sunday and he's right: the past is the past.",
      "\"It's important to learn. Now we need to stay together, stay united and I can only say again thank you to the fans.",
      "\"The owner has also been very supportive in this transition year and now we just need to work really hard and do everything we can to bring the club back to the top.",
      "\"I'm very excited about what's coming ahead of us. Like Ruben said, now we just need to work really hard as a unit, as a club and I'm sure the good days will be back, as he said.\""

River have an impressive record at home in the derby, losing just one of the last seven iterations.",

      "Cunha believes United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and, regardless of interest from other clubs, the Brazil international wants to play for United.",
      "The forward has enjoyed a standout season at Wolves, scoring 17 goals and providing six assists across 34 appearances.",
      "\"What happened [on Tuesday] is that United contacted Wolves and said they would like to trigger the clause but would like to pay the £62.5m in five instalments.",
      "\"Wolves turned around and said you've got to read the contract, it's there in black and white - we signed a new contract with the player in January, these are the terms of the contract, if you want him, the £62.5m needs to be paid in three instalments over two years. United have gone back to Wolves and said they'll accept those terms.",
      "\"United don't want to waste any time, they are pushing ahead to sign him and Wolves have said fine that's all good, you've triggered the release clause, we will now give you permission to speak to the player and also for the player to have a medical.",
      "\"So if all goes well with the medical, Matheus Cunha will become a Manchester United player.",
      "\"A lot of people who don't support Manchester United are asking, 'Where's the money coming from? We thought United were in trouble financially, we thought they'd missed out on the Champions League, potentially £100m. How come straight away they can afford to sign Matheus Cunha?'",
      "\"The £62.5m is not being paid in one lump sum, like most transfers, it's being paid in instalments and it's going to be three instalments of £21m.",
      "\"For a club the size of Manchester United, you would have to say that is affordable. They have got financial fair play PSR concerns like all other clubs, players will be leaving Manchester United this summer as well but Cunha won't be the only signing.",
      "\"I think they will make other signings, but the signings really have to work because you speak to a lot of people in football and they will tell you Manchester United's recruitment has just not been good enough.\""

      "Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing and upsetting; Antony has been on loan at Real Betis from Manchester United since January; Brazilian winger faces Chelsea on Wednesday in the Conference League final;",
      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",
      "\"I even get emotional because it was very difficult for me. Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",
      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
