      "Throughout his Manchester United tenure, Ruben Amorim made it clear he wasn't to be trifled with. The head coach has been sacked after just 14 months, with more stories from his brief time in charge now coming to the fore now that he has been given his marching orders.",
      "Amorim's relationship with Lisandro Martinez has been in focus following the dismissal. He is said to have had a heated confrontation with the Argentine during a training session, with Martinez's omission from starting line-ups believed to be the focus, though the pair are said to have left the exchange without particular ill-will.",
      "Indeed, Amorim even gave the captain's armband to Martinez for his final few games, with regular skipper Bruno Fernandes injured, in what has been described as a show of respect to the World Cup winner. Still, we saw earlier in Amorim's reign that he could be a harsh taskmaster, going as far as banning five of United's players from first team training.",
      "In July, members of United's so-called 'bomb squad' were kept apart from the rest of Amorim's squad. According to reports at the time from The Athletic, the quintet of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were asked to only report for training after 5pm, after Amorim and the other senior players had left Carrington.",
      "The group were also reportedly instructed to attend the training complex while the rest of the group were away for a pre-season friendly with Leeds United. However, there has been a way back for those who have clashed with the boss.",
      "While Rashford, Antony and Sancho left on loan, and Garnacho made a permanent switch to Chelsea, Malacia has been reintegrated after no buyer was found over the summer. The Dutch left-back made the bench for the first time this season in October and played his first minutes for United in 11 months when he came off the bench against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Similarly, Martinez was offered a way back in despite his confrontation with the boss. However, Amorim's inner disciplinarian - coupled with his willingness to vocally call out those at the club in his comments to the press - may have combined to seal his fate.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" Amorim said after the 1-1 draw at Leeds which would prove to be his final match in charge.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "It wasn't the first time he spoke his mind in a manner which some might have considered to have gone too far. In August, after a Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby Town, he almost dared the higher-ups to sack him.",
      "\"I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I'm not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" he said. \"But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",
      "As the fallout from Amorim's exit continues, plenty of theories are sure to surface when it comes to the straw that broke the camel's back. Still, throughout his 14 months in charge, he could prove challenging to deal with in a manner which might have mattered less if United were flying up the table.",
      "Ultimately, the club claimed they decided a change was needed in order to \"give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish\". Only they will know how big a part that motivation played in their decision.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wednesday will see Darren Fletcher become the fifth player from the school of Sir Alex Ferguson to manage Manchester United for at least one game. Fletcher, 41, has been installed as the club's interim manager following the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday.",
      "The former United midfielder, who came through their academy before making 342 appearances for the first-team, will lead the Red Devils in their trip to Burnley, joined by ex-team-mate Jonny Evans as part of his coaching staff. Fletcher has no experience of first-team management but he's been learning his trade in the world of coaching over the past few years.",
      "In July, the Scot was appointed as head coach of United's under-18 side. Fletcher previously worked in assistant roles under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag, and became the club's first ever technical director in 2021.",
      "Having been diagnosed with a chronic bowel disease in 2011 and been forced to stop playing temporarily, the five-time Premier League winner delved into coaching. A decade and a half later and he'll be on the touchline as United's interim boss.",
      "Fletcher joins Solskjaer, Ryan Giggs, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy as those to have played under Ferguson and gone on to stand where he did for the best part of 27 years. But not everyone is cut out for management in the long term, Ferguson has warned.",
      "In 2017, the legendary former United manager spoke to West Bromwich Albion about Fletcher's prospects as a coach. \"I think his long-term position will be as a coach,\" Ferguson explained.",
      "\"Maybe even management. He's got the presence, he's got the sacrifice. When you become a manager, Martin (interviewer), it's a sacrifice.",
      "\"You give up your family life, which I did. I scouted my own players, I went to games every week - midweek and everywhere. That's the kind of sacrifice and you need to have the type of wife who understands that.\"",
      "Will Darren Fletcher be a success as interim manager? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "While coaching at youth level brings its own pressures, nothing compares to a top job, especially at Old Trafford. Still, managing United is Fletcher's dream job.",
      "\"When I take my first steps on the management ladder, the goal is to become Manchester United manager because that's the pinnacle for me,\" he told the UTD Podcast in 2019. \"Nothing tops that, nothing's bigger.\"",
      "The road to becoming United's full-time manager may well start at Turf Moor. Currently, Fletcher is also expected to be remain in charge for Sunday's FA Cup tie at home to Brighton.",

      "Whether United look to bring in a new face this month or not, the squad does need work. Plenty of players are being linked with a move to Old Trafford. There has also been an update on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's imminent arrival...",
      "Marcus Rashford isn't expected to return to United after being bombed out of the club by Amorim in the summer. The England international and teammates Jadon Sancho, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund were all permitted to leave on loan after losing their spot in Amorim's plans.",
      "However, with United set to appoint a new head coach, The Sun has reported that the loan departures were all approved by those above Amorim, and there is no expected U-turn on the decisions.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan for the 2025/26 season, scoring seven times and assisting eight. The Spanish side has the option to sign him permanently for £30m in the summer, something that is anticipated to happen.",
      "The report claims that Rashford is highly unlikely to return to Old Trafford, regardless of who the manager is.",
      "Solskjaer is the favourite to take over at United until the end of the season. The Norwegian has held talks with the club, alongside Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy, after leaving the club in 2021.",
      "It's understood that United are keen to appoint an interim head coach for the remainder of the 2025/26 season, with a permanent appointment to follow for the new campaign. However, according to the Guardian, Solskjaer has the ambition to land the job on a full-time basis, should he do well.",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy is reportedly one man on Manchester United's shortlist of potential managers to take over until the end of the season - a matter of months after the Dutchman was torn apart by one of his former players.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, who had a four-game spell as United's caretaker boss last season, has been out of work since leaving Leicester City back in June. But according to the Daily Mail, the 49-year-old is being considered by United as someone that could take charge until the end of the campaign, after Ruben Amorim was sacked.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who previously spent almost three years as United's manager between 2018 and 2021, is among the frontrunners on the shortlist alongside Van Nistelrooy.",
      "Should Van Nistelrooy be given the United job, it would be his first managerial role since a disastrous seven-month stint at Leicester last season. Van Nistelrooy took over from Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium in November 2024, but won just five of his 27 Premier League matches in charge. The Foxes ended up finishing 18th, 10 points adrift of safety and became the first top-flight club to go nine games without scoring at home.",
      "Van Nistelrooy's record at Leicester was dismal, it's safe to say, and it hasn't convinced many of his managerial capabilities. Someone who wasn't convinced was Odsonne Edouard, who spent last season on loan at the Foxes from Crystal Palace. Edouard, 27, made six appearances under Cooper before being completely cast aside by Van Nistelrooy. The Frenchman made the bench just once under the ex-PSV Eindhoven boss.",
      "After finding his form with Lens this season, scoring seven times in 14 Ligue 1 matches, Edouard delivered a brutal verdict on Van Nistelrooy back in October and said he is not a 'great coach'.",
      "\"Being a great striker doesn't necessarily mean being a great coach,\" Edouard told L'Equipe. \"After training, I would do an even harder session with my fitness coach. I didn't give up.",
      "\"Leicester, it had a professional impact on me. I don't really have any reasons. At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn't work out with Van Nistelrooy.",
      "\"I didn't get along well with Van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.\"",
      "Before his troubled time at Leicester, Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a successful four-game reign as United's caretaker head coach following Erik ten Hag's dismissal in October 2024. He won three and drew the other of his four matches, with two of those victories coming against Cooper's Leicester in the Carabao Cup and Premier League. Van Nistelrooy's other win came against PAOK in the Europa League, while the draw came at home to Chelsea.",
      "Amorim was then appointed as United's new head coach and he decided not to keep Van Nistelrooy, who was offered the Leicester job two weeks later, as part of his backroom staff.",

      "Manchester United are looking to the past for a future managerial appointment. The Red Devils are on the hunt for a new face in the dugout following the sacking of Ruben Amorim and it could be a familiar one.",
      "The Portuguese coach was dismissed earlier this week following a disappointing 14 months in charge. While club chiefs will be on the lookout for a permanent replacement, an interim appointment appears to be the most likely course of action.",
      "And a number of former United stars have emerged as contenders to claim the role. According to numerous reports, former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a frontrunner to claim the role after early talks and has been spotted in Cheshire.",
      "Darren Fletcher, who has been handed the caretaker position, is another option, while ex-teammate Michael Carrick could also be parachuted in. Ruud van Nistelrooy is another name to have been mentioned, having fulfilled the same role to success last term.",
      "But is that always the way when United opt for an interim manager? Take a look at some of the Red Devils’ most recent returning faces and how they got on after claiming a spot in the Old Trafford hotseat:",
      "W2, D1, L1",
      "Replacing Sir Alex Ferguson was always going to be a lofty task for United. And David Moyes was only given a short period in which to do that after being personally headhunted by the legendary Scottish manager.",
      "He was sacked midway through his first season and was replaced by club legend Ryan Giggs. The Welshman turned to a host of youth players towards the end of the season and rounded off his stint in charge with a number of positive results.",
      "He beat Norwich 4-0 in his opening game, before slipping to a 1-0 defeat to Sunderland. United saw off Hull City 3-1, before Giggs’ temporary spell concluded with a 1-1 draw against Southampton.",
      "Giggs was confirmed as assistant boss to the incoming Louis van Gaal, while he then departed the club with the arrival of Jose Mourinho.",
      "W91, D37, L40",
      "On the topic of the Portuguese, he was actually replaced by another interim option. It was certainly a surprise to see Solskjaer handed the reins at Old Trafford following a dismal spell with Cardiff City.",
      "But it was an inspired decision from United, with Solskjaer winning 14 of his 19 matches as interim manager - a run of form that saw him handed the job on a full-term basis. Highlights from his caretaker spell included a 5-1 win against Cardiff on his debut, as well as a memorable Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "The Norwegian also led United to the 2021 Europa League final but was unable to claim the trophy against Ajax. Solskjaer was eventually sacked just under three years after being appointed and was replaced by another former United star.",
      "W2, D1, L0",
      "Following the success that they had enjoyed with Solskjaer, United attempted to repeat the trick with a move for former midfielder Michael Carrick, who had held roles under Mourinho and Solskjaer.",
      "Carrick was retained following the exit of the latter and was appointed on a caretaker basis. He enjoyed a dream start by beating Villarreal in the Champions League, while he also secured a respectable draw with Chelsea in his first league game.",
      "Carrick rounded off his caretaker spell by beating Arsenal 3-2 ahead of being replaced by Ralf Rangnick. The former has since taken in a spell with Middlesbrough but now finds himself out of work after being sacked by the Championship side earlier this season.",
      "W3, D1, L0",
      "The most recent example of United’s willingness to look to the past came only last season after Erik ten Hag was dismissed. After impressing with Dutch side PSV, former forward Van Nistelrooy returned to Old Trafford to be part of his compatriot’s coaching team.",
      "He was retained after Ten Hag was axed and enjoyed an impressive four-game spell at the helm. Van Nistelrooy led United to a 5-2 Carabao Cup win against Leicester in his first game and followed that up with a 1-1 draw with Chelsea.",
      "The Red Devils saw off PAOK in Van Nistelrooy’s third game before he rounded off an impressive stint with a 3-0 win vs Leicester in the Premier League. Van Nistelrooy was not retained following Amorim’s arrival and was soon handed a new role at the King Power Stadium.",
      "He endured a woeful spell in the Midlands, losing 19 of his 27 games in charge. He has yet to return to the dugout.",

      "Oliver Glasner is to “intensify” talks about a new Crystal Palace deal this month before making a “final decision” about his future. But the Austrian insisted a long contract does not guarantee staying at a club - and claimed new record signing Brennan Johnson could be sold this summer for a “massive fee”.",
      "Glasner, who led the Eagles to FA Cup glory last year, is on Manchester United’s radar as he is out of contract and available for free at the end of the season.",
      "The Europa League champion with Eintracht Frankfurt is a proven winner and a good communicator. He also deploys a variation of the 3-4-3 system used by Ruben Amorim at the South London club, though whether that is a plus point for the Old Trafford club and their fans is now debatable. Palace are also without a win in seven games in all competitions.",
      "Glasner claimed before Christmas that Palace’s hectic fixture schedule - with eight games in December - meant there was no time for contract talks.",
      "But before facing Aston Villa on Wednesday night, the Eagles boss said: “I think in the next weeks, we will intensify the talks. With Macclesfield, Friday again, we go up north, and then everyone gets three days off after Macclesfield and then we have to target four regular weeks and in those weeks we will intensify the talks and I expect to find a final decision.”",
      "Glasner, who replaced Roy Hodgson in February 2024, is the eighth longest-serving manager in the top flight. And he is relaxed about putting pen to paper - and getting linked with the Manchester United job.",
      "During his 51-minute press conference yesterday, the 51-year-old said: “There has been speculation since I arrived. So, believe me, I don't really care about it. I can sign today, or a player can sign a contract extension today and leave in summer. That's why for me, the length of a contract in these times doesn't say anything about your future.",
      "“How long does Brennan's contract last? Four and a half years? So, if you sign a four-year contract, you can't honestly expect that you're always having the same manager, and I think that's why a player never signs just for a manager, he signs for a club, for the vision of a club. It’s not Oliver Glasner.",
      "“Of course, you want to hear from the actual manager but that doesn't mean this lasts forever.",
      "“I talk to Brennan but to be honest, let's talk about just our situation. Brennan signs now, he scores now, 12 goals until summer, a big club comes, pays a massive fee and he leaves. and I sign a new contract and I can't say: 'We talked about it, you know, we've worked together for three years, why don't you stay anymore?'”",
      "Johnson was signed for £35m at the start of the January window after Glasner had previously complained about Palace’s slow buying business.",
      "The South London club have sold Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze in the last two summer windows and are set to lose captain Marc Guehi either this January or at the end of the season.",
      "After winning Palace’s first major trophy and taking them into the UEFA Conference League, it is debatable what more Glasner can achieve at Selhurst Park.",
      "But the Austrian stated: “Believe me, nothing that happens in the transfer window, nothing, affects my decision, nothing. In both directions.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Solskjaer appears to be the leading candidate, having expressed a keen desire to return to Old Trafford after being sacked as manager in November 2021. Currently based in Cheshire, the Norwegian's first stint in the hot seat came when he took over as interim boss from Jose Mourinho in November 2018.",
      "His appointment sparked a remarkable turnaround in form and secured him the role permanently on that previous occasion.",

      "Former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has been confirmed as technical director of FC Twente after four months without a job. The Dutchman is set to replace current director Jan Streuer next season but will keep a close eye on the club’s operations until then.",
      "Speaking after his appointment was confirmed, Ten Hag said: “I think it's wonderful and special to return to FC Twente, where I've been a supporter at Het Diekman since I was a young boy. My football and coaching careers began here.",
      "“With my experience in youth development, team building, and elite sports culture, I want to strengthen FC Twente's technical foundation together with the Supervisory Board, management, and staff, so the club can sustainably realize its potential as a regional flagship.”",
      "\"We are delighted to welcome Erik ten Hag to FC Twente,\" general manager Dominique Scholten said. \"Starting next season, Erik will succeed Jan Streuer, who has made a significant contribution to FC Twente's current status over the past five and a half years. We owe Jan a great deal of gratitude for that.\"",
      "Explaining why Twente have chosen to appoint Ten Hag, Scholten added: \"Erik has an incredible track record in football, and his bond with FC Twente has always remained very strong. At FC Twente, he served as youth coach, head of academy, and assistant coach, and subsequently as head coach and technical manager at renowned clubs, both nationally and internationally.",
      "“We've been in regular contact over the past few months, and our conversations quickly revealed a strong ambition to further develop FC Twente. This ambition aligns with the strategy we recently presented.",
      "“We are raising the bar and further professionalizing the football organization. We took the first step in this direction last year with the arrival of Tim Gilissen.\"",
      "Ten Hag had been out of work since a doomed spell with German side Bayer Leverkusen. The former United boss was appointed by the Bundesliga club in the summer but was sacked after just three matches.",
      "Ten Hag now returns to Twente, having had three spells with the Dutch side as a player, making 162 appearances. Since then, he has managed Go Ahead Eagles, Utrecht and Ajax in his homeland.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee’s move from Manchester United to Roma has been left up in the air, the Italian club’s director Ricky Massara has admitted. The Dutchman was previously linked with a return to Serie A after falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Roma were among the sides interested, with a loan deal touted. But with the Portuguese coach having been sacked this week, that has given Zirkzee fresh hope of career revival at Old Trafford. Speaking about a potential deal, Massara has admitted that a deal now looks slightly more complicated than before as Roma attempt to sign a striker.",
      "“It’s true that there are negotiations in progress with both Atletico Madrid and [Giacomo] Raspadori. The situation is evolving, we knew the timing could be affected by the Spanish Supercup. We expect it to be resolved one way or another fairly soon,” Massara told Sky Sport Italia.",
      "“He [Zirkzee] is a Manchester United centre-forward liked by many clubs, not just us. Naturally, the situation is different after this change of management, there are no contacts in progress, but I wouldn’t focus on individual names.",
      "“We know this window is an opportunity to reinforce the squad in an area where we have struggled to convert chances into goals, so we will try to use it.”",
      "Zirkzee, 24, was signed in July 2024 in a £36.5million move from Bologna. He has gone on to make 63 appearances since then but has scored just nine goals.",
      "The striker has three-and-a-half years left on his contract at Old Trafford. Fresh talk over his future comes amid glowing praise from teammate Matheus Cunha.",
      "Speaking after the recent draw with Leeds United, the Brazilian said: \"Josh is a pleasure. I feel like he has a lot of quality. Of course, his situation is not easy, but he has everything to change the situation. We need him. He needs to understand this and then everyone can count on him.",
      "\"But yeah, we are here to push him. And I think after the goal last week and the assist today, I think it will give him confidence to be more with us and then understand more his role in the team.\"",
      "Away from Roma, Zirkzee was also linked with a potential switch to Premier League rivals Everton. The striker could get a couple of chances over the next week should an exit not come to fruition. United take on Burnley on Wednesday, ahead of getting their FA Cup campaign underway against Brighton at the weekend.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a leading contender to make a comeback at Manchester United on a temporary basis until the season's end. The ex-United boss was sighted in Cheshire amid speculation around him returning to the club.",
      "Solskjaer was shown the door in November 2021 after nearly three years at the helm. The ex-striker took over from Jose Mourinho at the close of 2018 as interim head coach, before being given the job full-time in 2019. United are on the hunt for a stopgap head coach after deciding to give Ruben Amorim the boot on Monday.",
      "While Van Nistelrooy took charge of four United games on an interim basis following Erik ten Hag's dismissal last season, it's also understood that Solskjaer and Carrick have been tapped to take charge until the season wraps up. Solskjaer parted ways with Besiktas in August after the Turkish team were knocked out of the Conference League.",
      "Solskjaer, who played alongside Darren Fletcher, is being considered to steer United until the season's end. The Norwegian is emerging as a front-runner after expressing his eagerness to make a comeback at the club.",
      "During his previous tenure, Solskjaer led the team to consecutive top-three finishes in the Premier League - the first person to do so since Sir Alex Ferguson's era - and guided them to the Europa League final, where they were defeated by Villarreal.",
      "Their second-place finish in 2021 is a feat only he and Mourinho have accomplished since Ferguson's retirement in 2013. In his playing career, the former Cardiff City manager made over 200 appearances for United, clinching six Premier League titles and the legendary treble in 1999.",
      "It's believed that United are seeking an interim solution until the season's end before appointing a permanent head coach for the 2026/27 season. Fletcher is expected to take the reins for Wednesday night's Premier League match against Burnley and Sunday's FA Cup fixture with Brighton.",

      "Darren Fletcher has been placed in caretaker charge for the game. And he could have a couple of key players available once again after Fernandes and Mount both missed the draw with Leeds United. United captain Fernandes has missed the last three games, while Mount has sat out of the last two.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Fletcher said: “Mason [Mount] and Bruno [Fernandes] were pushing to play against Leeds and the decision was that they weren't quite ready. So they have trained and they should be back in the squad.",
      "“They are on managed minutes and restricted minutes because they have only just returned to training so that is good news, especially because they are players who have been in good form. Mason Mount's form has been fantastic and Bruno Fernandes... you don't have to speak about him.",
      "“He's the captain, the leader of the team. To have them available for selection is obviously great news for me, the players and the club and the fans.”",
      "And while United might have Mount and Fernandes to call upon once more, they are still missing a few stars. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui remain at the African Cup of Nations, while Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt have recently been struggling with their own issues.",
      "Should the trio remain out, that could see Fletcher add to the squad with youth players - sons Jack and Tyler among those who could be included. The former midfielder stopped short of confirming whether they would be in the squad.",

      "“What happened with Rúben is something that only Rúben can analyse,” Mourinho said to Portuguese outlet O Jogo. “I believe he will do it, he and his staff. Whether he will do it with you and make his view public, that I do not know.”",
      "Asked if Amorim’s exit could add pressure for other promising young Portuguese coaches, Mourinho added: “I do not understand why it would, but each coach will answer for himself. For me, no, I do not feel it that way.”",
      "Of course, Mourinho is no stranger to the sack. The Portuguese was also fired by the Red Devils following a two-and-a-half year stint at Old Trafford.",
      "While he has refused to compare his experience to Amorim’s, Mourinho has suggested that new opportunities could soon present themselves to the former Sporting Lisbon boss.",
      "“My career at Manchester United, I know it well. I also know the reason why I ended up leaving,” Mourinho said. “But as I always do, or try to do, when I leave a club I close the door and then I do not make comments. I do not analyse externally what happened.",

      "Manchester United are searching for a new head coach following the departure of Ruben Amorim on Monday morning. The club confirmed in a statement: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher has been appointed to oversee Wednesday's fixture against Burnley, though it's unclear whether he'll remain in charge for the remainder of the campaign before a permanent appointment is made in the summer. Meanwhile, Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have been mentioned as possible interim options for the rest of 2025/26, with reports on Tuesday afternoon suggesting contact had been made between the latter's camp and the club.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is currently favourite to take up tenure at United. The Norwegian enjoyed a three-year stint with the club between 2018 and 2021 and has already demonstrated that he can hold his own in the Premier League. An interim or caretaker role until season's end is the most likely scenario, but it remains to be seen as to whether that would interest Solskjaer.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has also been linked with being next in line for the United hot seat. The Austrian said of the role in September: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\" Out of contract at Selhurst Park this summer, a move to United any sooner looks unlikely considering Glasner's commitment to the club.",
      "Out of the managerial game since stepping down from the England national team last summer, Gareth Southgate has been linked with a role with the Reds for some time now. It is unknown whether he would be willing to step up in an interim job, or whether a permanent role would solely appeal to him at present.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins of the first-team for United's clash with Burnley on Wednesday. However, the club could afford him the rest of the season on an interim basis depending on how he fares this week, as they continue to search for a full-time appointment.",
      "An appointment for Thomas Tuchel is highly unlikely at present, considering the German is currently preparing to guide England to glory at the 2026 World Cup. However, his name has been put out there by the bookies.",
      "Enzo Maresca could be set for a return to Premier League management just a week after leaving Chelsea. The Italian head coach has a solid resume with the Blues, including a Europa Conference League title and last summer's Club World Cup win.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino has also found himself highlighted as a suitable candidate to guide United to glory. The Argentine has experience in the Premier League with both Chelsea and Tottenham, although is currently tied up with the USA national team ahead of the World Cup.",
      "Michael Carrick has been out of a job since he was sacked by Middlesbrough last summer, and given his past affiliation with the Reds, could work as a caretaker until season's end. He has previously worked in a caretaker role, and will know what is expected by the board.",
      "Barcelona legend, Xavi, is another name which has been mentioned with regard to taking up a head coach role at Old Trafford. The La Liga legend has enjoyed managerial stints at Al Sadd and at the Camp Nou, but has never managed - nor played for - an English team.",
      "Currently in charge of Ipswich, who are third in the Championship standings, Kieran McKenna is also a bit of a long shot for the job. However, given he has previously worked at the club as an assistant to Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer, he could be a good fit should he have his head turned."

      "There are a number of targets on the club's radar, especially in the midfield area, with the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson potential summer targets. The indication so far is there's unlikely to be the money for marquee signings like that in January but that doesn't mean United will be silent.",
      "While United find themselves waiting until the summer to spend big, there could be scope for more creative deals in the meantime. One of these involves RB Leipzig starlet El Chadaille Bitshiabu, with L'Equipe reporting that the Premier League club could come in with an offer of a loan with an option to buy",
      "They are unlikely to be the only club in the mix, though. Bayer Leverkusen are said to be exploring a similar deal, while Monaco are also keen amid a defensive injury crisis and Lyon also in the mix.",
      "There's one bigger problem, though. Earlier reports from Bild indicated Leipzig are not prepared to sanction an exit for the young defender in January. This, the German outlet claims, applies to both loans and permanent deals.",
      "Bitshiabu returned from a hamstring injury in December but has been used sparingly by his club this season. Just three of his five appearances have come in the league, with Castello Lukeba and Willi Orban ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Yan Diomande's fast start at RB Leipzig has prompted plenty of interest from across Europe but a January switch looks to be off the cards. Diomande joined the German club from Leganes over the summer but has already caught the eye, not least with the hat-trick he scored against Eintracht Frankfurt in early December.",
      "Manchester United are one of two Premier League clubs in the mix, according to The Athletic. Tottenham Hotspur are also said to be keen on the Ivorian teenager, who Leipzig expect to command a fee of up to £86million, as are a number of unnamed clubs from elsewhere in Europe.",
      "Premier League clubs have had what can only be described as mixed success when signing players from Leipzig in recent windows. Josko Gvardiol and Dominik Szoboszlai have done the business for Manchester City and Liverpool respectively but attacking players haven't been quite as efficient.",
      "The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko after he joined United from the Bundesliga side in the last window, while Timo Werner and Christopher Nkunku failed to repeat their Leipzig scoring feats after moving to Chelsea. Both forwards were sold at a loss by the Blues, with Werner returning to Leipzig and Nkunku joining AC Milan.",

      "United have also shown a keen interest in Wharton. According to Spanish outlet AS, Slot's side also face a battle with Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid for the player, with the publication claiming that any club will have to fork out a considerable amount for the defensive midfielder.",
      "Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott has been linked with a surprise move to Charlotte FC in the States but a new development appears to make a move unlikely.",
      "According to The Athletic, sources close to the player have played down interest in the Englishman securing a move to America. Elliott's season-long loan to Aston Villa hasn't worked out and now attentions have turned to the next step in his career with the World Cup looming.",
      "Elliott has joined Villa on a loan with an obligation to buy - £35m - should he reach 10 appearances for the club. However, Elliott has been stuck on five appearances since October and only two of those were starts.",
      "It's clear Villa won't be meeting the 10 appearances and he cannot be loaned out to another club this season unless their fixtures do not align with the European calendar - hence the Charlotte FC interest.",
      "With Mohamed Salah at AFCON and experiencing poor form, Liverpool could do with a player of Elliott's calibre, so a return to his club could work out well for all parties. However, there is no re-call option in the contract, so the deal would have to be cancelled entirely for him to return to Liverpool.",

      "Arsenal’s incredible form does not appear to be slowing them down in the transfer market. With Mikel Arteta’s side six points clear in the Premier League and also top of the Champions League table, they would be forgiven for thinking they already have enough talent in their squad.",
      "They have been boosted by several players such as Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz, Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes returning from injury, adding to the already stacked squad they built in the summer with their stunning spending spree.",
      "Yet, this season has proven there are no certainties when it comes to keeping key players fit, while the Gunners have also been punished in previous January windows for their inactivity come the end of the season.",
      "With Arteta already detailing his plans in relation to bringing in fresh faces this month, there are several names currently being linked with a move to N5.",
      "It is no secret that Arsenal have ramped up their efforts to increase the talent in their academy over the past 18 months. The Gunners’ youth recruitment drive has already seen them snap up Irish midfielder Victor Ozhianvuna, 16, from Shamrock Rovers, as well as Ecuadorian twins Edwin and Holger Quintero, 16, all of whom will officially join next year when they are of age.",
      "It seems they are not willing to stop there, with The Sun reporting Arsenal now want to sign 17-year-old Blackburn Rovers wonderkid Igor Tyjon. The striker made his debut for Blackburn in 2024 as a 16-year-old and is currently on scholarship terms after reportedly turning down the chance to sign a professional contract.",
      "It’s claimed Blackburn have already rejected several bids from Arsenal worth over £1million for the teenager, though they are begrudgingly accepting he will now leave at some stage given his refusal to sign a pro contract. This month is the final chance for Blackburn to command a transfer fee for Tyjon.",
      "Arsenal are reportedly the frontrunners in the race to sign Karim Adeyemi from Borussia Dortmund. The 23-year-old German international has been linked with several Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, having established himself as one of the Bundesliga’s best wingers.",
      "Adeyemi, who is said to be worth around £61m, was last month reported to want to leave the German giants. Now, with the instability caused by Ruben Amorim’s sacking at United, CaughtOffside claims their rivals Arsenal are more likely to sign the player given the proven success of Arteta’s project.",
      "The report states Arsenal’s sporting director Andrea Berta has laid the framework for the deal and \"outlined a defined role\" for Adeyemi, who is being eyed as long-term competition for Gabriel Martinelli on the left flank.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has emerged as the favourite to take charge of Manchester United from Darren Fletcher until the end of this season after Ruben Amorim's sacking. A return to Old Trafford could come mere months after Marcus Rashford spoke highly of his first stint at the club.",
      "The Norwegian, who has been without a club since his Besiktas sacking last year, is said to be one of the frontrunners alongside Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy to take over on a caretaker basis, with the club deciding to wait until the summer to appoint a new permanent boss.",
      "Solskjaer is now the favourite with some bookmakers to be given the nod and knows the club inside out, having spent 11 years of his playing career at Old Trafford before managing the team for three years between 2018 and 2021. He still has a strong bond with a number of United players and recently spoke glowingly about Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire.",
      "Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona from United, was also left with a high impression of Solskjaer, having enjoyed some of his best football under the club icon. The forward told the Danish television station TV2 in October last year: \"Ole is a fantastic person. I loved playing under him. I can speak for many of the players at Manchester United when I say that we enjoyed playing for him. We played good football under Ole.",
      "\"It was a very successful period for me personally. He is a fantastic person, and I don't have a bad word to say about him.\"",
      "Rashford also said he talks to Solskjaer \"from time to time\". However, he conceded that \"it's been a while now\" since they last spoke.",
      "The forward played more and scored more under him than any other United coach. Rashford had 55 goals and 36 assists across 135 matches.",
      "Out of Erik ten Hag, Mourinho and Solskjaer, the academy graduate also managed his best minutes per goal while working with the latter. He averaged a goal every 182 minutes, compared to one every 199 for Ten Hag and every 251 under Mourinho.",
      "Solskjaer took caretaker charge of United after they sacked Mourinho in December 2018, before being appointed as their permanent manager three months later. His tenure lasted just under three years in total, with Michael Carrick and then Ralf Rangnick taking interim charge before Ten Hag eventually took over.",
      "Solskjaer spoke about Rashford during an appearance on The Rest is Football in November. He said: \"I've not spoken to Marcus since I left. I text him a little bit, but circumstances.",
      "\"I don't know what's happened in his life, but you can see he's certainly enjoying it now in Barcelona. It looked like he didn't enjoy himself here. I don't think that's just Man United [not enjoying it], it's everywhere.",
      "\"All the pressures, every single one is different, we don't know what's happened to the players when they walk in in the morning, grumpy, that's the manager's job: 'What's up? I can see something's wrong.'",
      "\"We don't know what's happened, we just want him to do well. He's an incredible player when he's in form and happy; he's got that energy. I go back to Erling Haaland, just the energy that he shows all the time, when he's on the pitch, he shows that enthusiasm and energy, that's the least.",
      "\"But what is it? Life? Too many games? We don't know, but he's found the right balance.\"",

      "Former footballer Gordon McQueen attributed his dementia to heading the ball, the inquest into his death heard on Tuesday.",
      "She told the hearing in Northallerton, North Yorkshire: \"He would say 'yes, heading a football all those years probably hasn't helped'. I remember coming home from school and Dad would be in bed. Or having a lie down.",
      "\"He would say he's been having headaches. I remember thinking 'why are you having headaches?'\" McQueen made almost 350 appearances for St Mirren, Leeds and United between 1970 and 1985.",
      "Hayley told the inquest she did not remember him having head injuries during his career, other than a few concussions. But she outlined how loved ones noticed a change in his personality not long after his 60th birthday. He struggled with his swallowing and that \"continued for many years,\" Hayley said.",
      "\"His balance was very, very off and his personality started to change. My dad was very outgoing, dinners, part of the after-dinner circuit. He became off, which wasn't really my dad.\"",
      "Dysphagia caused the problem with swallowing, though McQueen had also been diagnosed with throat cancer. \"He just wouldn't really know what year it was or what day it was,\" Hayley added.",
      "\"He was very active and trying to do crosswords and watch football. He lost the ability to write. He couldn't make a cup of tea. He got confused about what went where. He kept saying, 'there's something not right in my head'. He used to get confused about things. Never people - he had an incredible memory for the past.",
      "\"It was more the withdrawn nature of my dad. He would be the centre of attention, but he had to be asked a question to speak.\"",
      "Michael Rawlinson KC, representing the McQueen family, asked how her father scored his goals.",
      "She replied: \"Mainly with his head, from a set-piece.\" They learned more about his illness after her mum Yvonne spoke with Dawn Astle, daughter of ex-England striker Jeff Astle, who had the brain condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and died in 2002 aged 59.",
      "Prof Willie Stewart, a consultant at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow who examined McQueen's brain after his death, said that CTE was present.",
      "\"Gordon technically fell into the lower stage of the disease, although on the threshold of the higher stage,\" he added. Prof Stewart said symptoms of CTE were cognitive decline and neuro-behaviour change, and that they \"can't be explained by another condition.\"",
      "He said symptoms were \"typical in individuals who have long careers, professional footballers and rugby players\". Asked if there was a causal link between CTE and repetitive head injury, he replied: \"The answer to that is yes.\"",
      "Senior coroner John Heath said the post-mortem found pneumonia in McQueen's right lung, mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "Prof Stewart, who conducted a 2021 study on whether certain positions on the pitch were more associated with neurodegenerative disease than others, said: \"The players, the goalkeepers who don't head the ball had a risk equivalent to general population, whereas in outfield positions, particularly defenders, the risk was higher.\"",
      "Mr Heath adjourned the inquest for legal submissions to be made in writing and said he will give his conclusions on January 26",

      "Ralf Rangnick looks set to have a major say in Manchester United’s search for a new manager, having green lit a move for Oliver Glasner AND his potential new boss. The Red Devils are on the hunt for Ruben Amorim’s successor following his sacking earlier this week.",
      "Former midfielder Darren Fletcher is taking temporary charge for the trip to Burnley on Wednesday, albeit United will be keen to agree a deal with a more permanent option sooner rather than later. The man tasked with sounding out Amorim’s replacement is set to be Christopher Vivell.",
      "According to Marca, the 39-year-old will be handed a far more prominent role in the club’s hunt for a new boss, as well as player recruitment going forwards. Vivell moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2024 as an interim director of recruitment, while he was then given the job on a full-term basis in February last year.",
      "Vivell has had spells with Hoffenheim, Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig - crossing paths with Rangnick during his stint with the Austrian and German sides. According to previous reports, Rangnick had head-hunted Vivell for a role at United, only to leave the club shortly after.",
      "Away from Vivell, it also appears that Rangnick would back a move for Crystal Palace boss Glasner. He has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford, with his future at Selhurst Park up in the air.",
      "Glasner’s contract expires at the end of the current campaign. Speaking about his compatriot back in 2023, Rangnick said: \"For me, Oliver Glasner is currently one of the most exciting coaches - not only in Germany, but in all of Europe. An absolute top coach.”",
      "Glasner in the meantime has also spoken out about his future and refused to commit to his current employers. He said: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Asked about his Palace contract situation last month, Glasner added: \"There's no time. Believe me, I'm never thinking about my future right at the moment. It's not important right now.",
      "\"I know there are so many rumours. But I don't know how many clubs I managed in the last three months and I'm still sitting here.",

      "Darren Fletcher won't tell his former teammates now working in the media to go easy on his Manchester United team, despite the criticism being levelled at players and the club being raised under Ruben Amorim. In his press conference broadside at club officials on Sunday, Amorim suggested that even executives were influenced by criticism from the likes of Gary Neville.",
      "The club's former right-back is one of a cohort of United greats who have waded in on the club in their media roles, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes also heavily critical. Those attacks have damaged the confidence of some players and caused divisions between the dressing room and some United greats, but Fletcher believes those now wearing the shirt should embrace the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can’t ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher said of the critical pundits he played with. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Although the withering attacks on a string of disappointing performances and underwhelming seasons have been seen internally as damaging, Fletcher turned the equation on its head and said players should be grateful for the support they receive inside Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters have rarely turned on the team despite their struggles, with Fletcher pointing out that wouldn't be the case everywhere given the struggles United have endured in recent years, with finishes of sixth, eighth and 15th in three of the previous four seasons.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher revealed the first phone call he made after being offered the role of Manchester United's interim head coach was to Sir Alex Ferguson, as he sought the blessing of his former boss before taking on the Old Trafford role. Fletcher was offered the position on Monday morning after United sacked Ruben Amorim and his coaching staff. However, he spoke to Ferguson about the job first, seeking the 84-year-old's guidance on whether he should accept it.",
      "Fletcher spent 20 years as an academy graduate and player at Old Trafford, with 18 of those years under the guidance of Ferguson, who remains a regular at United games and at Carrington. He was at the draw with Leeds on Sunday, which proved to be Amorim's final game in charge, and when Fletcher called, he echoed the sentiments his former midfielder had felt about the task at hand and his responsibilities if he were to take it on on a short-term basis.",
      "\"I don't like to make any major decisions or things without speaking to Sir Alex and that's something I've done since I've been at the club and since I've left the club and everything I do,\" Fletcher said. \"I've got a really good relationship with Sir Alex so he's probably the first person on the phone actually so I wanted to speak to him first. And ultimately, to get his blessing, to be perfectly honest with you, I think he deserves that respect.",
      "\"I wanted to run it by him, what he thought and he was supportive of it and he echoed my thoughts which I've always said. It's your job to do the best for Manchester United when you're an employee of the club. It's amazing when he says something that I try and live and believe every day, so it was comforting for me for him to say that.\"",
      "Fletcher also reached out to Amorim after the Portuguese head coach's dismissal. He felt he had a good working relationship with the 40-year-old and said he would always be grateful to him for handing a professional debut to his 18-year-old son Jack, while he also named Tyler in his final three matchday squads.",
      "\"I've reached out to him, I've not managed to make contact yet but that's understandable,\" he said. \"He's obviously got a lot on his mind and I've been really busy so I've not had the chance to.",
      "\"I'd love to because I had a good relationship with Ruben. He was great with me. He was very welcoming to me and to his staff at the end of last season, in terms of being the under-18s coach, in terms of small communication I've had this year, because I've been on another side of the building.",
      "\"Always good interactions and ultimately he's the manager who gave my son his debut as well. So as a father I've got a lot to thank him for. Although the boys have gone and earned that themselves, he was the manager who did that. So I've got a good relationship with Ruben, so I'm disappointed for him.\"",
      "Fletcher has held talks with the players since replacing Amorim, with a particular focus on those who he hasn't worked with before, having been around the first-team before starting his coaching journey with the Under-18s this season.",
      "The Scot held talks with captain Bruno Fernandes to gauge the mood in the squad and then held one-on-ones with summer signing Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in a bid to get to know them better and find out how they've settled in.",
      "\"I have had conversations with players, and it's been time-consuming, so I actually plan to have more conversations,\" he said. \"Maybe my first experience in the first days of Manchester United, you don't have as much time as you think, so in my head I had these plans of speaking to loads of players and it didn't pan out that way.",
      "\"I had a conversation with Bruno because that's important because he's the captain and I wanted to speak to him. I focused on a couple of players who I don't know so well, so Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"Senne [Lammens], I actually had a conversation with him not too long ago, but those two I focused on because I've not really got a relationship with them and I wanted to get to know them and I wanted them to get to know me.\"",

      "Fletcher spent 20 years as an academy graduate and player at Old Trafford, with 18 of those years under the guidance of Ferguson, who remains a regular at United games and at Carrington. He was at the draw with Leeds on Sunday, which proved to be Amorim's final game in charge, and when Fletcher called, he echoed the sentiments his former midfielder had felt about the task at hand and his responsibilities if he were to take it on on a short-term basis.",

      "A fresh era for Manchester United starts this evening when Darren Fletcher takes charge of the Reds for their trip to Burnley in the Premier League. The Scot has moved up to the United first team following the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday morning.",
      "Unfortunately for Fletcher, he has limited options to choose from to try and get a much-needed victory tonight. Amad, Noussair Mazraoui and Bryan Mbeumo remain unavailable due to their participation at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). As for injuries, captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount trained on Tuesday and are available tonight.",
      "Their minutes will be managed as they return to full match fitness but it is a boost for the Reds to have two players in such good form back available. Kobbie Mainoo, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are out due to injury issues.",
      "Our United writers have had their say on how they think United should line up tonight:",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "First thing's first, let's forget about a back three. It would be quite the plot twist if Fletcher decided he wanted to stick with Amorim's doomed formation. That means Dalot at right-back and Shaw at left-back, while I would stick with Heaven and Martinez at centre-back.",
      "Returning players in midfield means Ugarte can drop to the bench. Casemiro can play the holding role with Fernandes and Mount ahead of him, although there are doubts over whether either can make 90 minutes.",
      "Dorgu can play on the right wing, as he did successfully against Newcastle, with Cunha on the left, and Sesko is through the middle.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "It makes sense now the Amorim era has ended to revert to a four-man defence. I would start Fernandes. United need a lift after everything that has happened over the past few days and seeing the captain return would give them just that.",
      "The chances of him lasting 90 minutes are very slim but it would set the tone. Playing him deeper could be the safe option and recalling Zirkzee, who provided a great assist for Cunha at Leeds, could be a wise option.",

      "It has been a whirlwind couple of days for Manchester United following their draw at Leeds on Sunday lunchtime. Ruben Amorim made his thoughts on the Ineos decision-makers crystal clear after the game, was fired for said outburst and Darren Fletcher has taken charge.",
      "The former United midfielder and U18s coach will be looking to settle all of the noise surrounding the club with a straightforward victory against Burnley on Wednesday night. Scott Parker's relegation-threatened side have not won in their last 11 matches but as the Wolves game proved, no match will be easy for this squad.",
      "It is expected Fletcher will make some changes to the starting line-up tonight - chief of which would be to revert to a four-at-the-back system. Sticking with a three would be a rogue decision considering the fallout which led to Amorim's sacking. But while the 4-3-3 could be considered when players are back from injury and the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), a 4-2-3-1 seems more likely when they make the short trip to Turf Moor tonight.",
      "Out of the defensive line that started at Elland Road, we expect Leny Yoro to be the one who misses out. Ayden Heaven switched off for the Leeds goal at the weekend but United will hope this is a blip in an otherwise stellar run of form for the Reds' defender.",
      "Fletcher would love to call upon Bruno Fernandes to play alongside Casemiro in the holding role but while he could be part of the matchday squad, he will have his minutes managed. Therefore, Manuel Ugarte will most likely keep his place in the squad.",
      "While Fletcher's son Jack has featured for United in recent weeks and is being considered for the matchday squad alongside his brother Tyler, it may be too bold a call to start him in his first match in interim charge. In attacking midfield, Patrick Dorgu will be keen to make a point at right wing.",
      "He did well there when Amorim experimented with four-at-the-back against Newcastle. The worry for Dorgu is, when all players are back, he is not going to be first choice in that position which will be a concern.",
      "Matheus Cunha should keep his place after a well-taken goal at Leeds and the man who provided the assist, Joshua Zirkzee, should also return to the starting line-up. His future is firmly up in the air and while Mason Mount may take his place ordinarily, Fletcher is unlikely to risk him with a start.",
      "With Zirkzee playing deeper, Benjamin Sesko will undoubtedly lead the line. The 22-year-old desperately needs a goal.",
      "United predicted XI vs Burnley: Lammens; Dalot, Heaven, Martinez, Shaw; Ugarte, Casemiro; Dorgu, Zirkzee, Cunha; Sesko",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has held talks with Manchester United just months after being heavily criticised by one of his former players.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, who briefly served as United's caretaker manager last season, has been unemployed since departing Leicester City in the summer. United have also spoken to Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, as well as Darren Fletcher, who is currently in charge.",
      "The Norwegian is emerging as the leading candidate after making his desperation to return clear. He has been out of work since being sacked by Besiktas earlier this season.",
      "If Van Nistelrooy returns to United instead, it would mark his first managerial position since a disastrous seven-month tenure at Leicester last season. The legendary striker took over from Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium in November 2024.",
      "However, he managed only five victories in his 27 Premier League matches in charge. The Foxes ultimately finished 18th, a full 10 points from safety.",
      "They also set an unfortunate record as the first top-tier club to go nine home games without scoring a goal. Van Nistelrooy's stint at Leicester has not persuaded many of his suitability as a manager.",
      "One individual who remained unconvinced was Odsonne Edouard. He spent the previous campaign on loan at the Foxes from Crystal Palace.",
      "The 27-year-old featured in six matches under Cooper before being entirely sidelined by Van Nistelrooy. The French striker was named on the substitutes' bench just once during the former PSV Eindhoven coach's tenure.",
      "He has returned to form with Lens this season, netting seven goals in 14 Ligue 1 fixtures. Edouard offered a scathing assessment of Van Nistelrooy back in October, declaring he is not a 'great coach'.",
      "\"Being a great striker doesn't necessarily mean being a great coach,\" Edouard told L'Equipe. \"After training, I would do an even harder session with my fitness coach.",
      "\"I didn't give up. Leicester, it had a professional impact on me.",
      "\"I don't really have any reasons. At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn't work out with Van Nistelrooy.",
      "\"I didn't get along well with Van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.\"",
      "Before his challenging stint at Leicester, Van Nistelrooy had a successful interim spell as United's head coach following the dismissal of Erik ten Hag in October 2024. He led the team to three victories and one draw in his four-match tenure, with two wins against Cooper's Leicester in both the Carabao Cup and Premier League.",
      "The other victory was secured against PAOK in the Europa League, while the draw came at home against Chelsea. Following this, Amorim was appointed as the new head coach of United and chose not to retain Van Nistelrooy on his coaching staff. Two weeks later, Van Nistelrooy got the managerial role at Leicester.",

      "Gareth Southgate has unsurprisingly emerged in the list of potential managers set to be pursued by Manchester United. Ruben Amorim was finally dismissed on Monday after a fiery end to his miserable 14 months in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "The United hierarchy have since named club legend Darren Fletcher as interim boss while they look to appoint a seventh permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Southgate, who hasn’t managed since resigning after losing the Euro 2024 final, has repeatedly been linked with the United job since Sir Jim Ratcliffe purchased a minority stake in the club in February 2024.",
      "It was reported in October last year that he was debating whether to throw his hat in the ring during Amorim's tenure. Reports have now once again emerged linking Southgate to the vacant role, though there are claims he has some reservations over whether he will be given the necessary time to build his squad over a prolonged period.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Given all the uproar about Amorim’s failed 3-4-2-1 formation, it is unlikely that Southgate will implement the same formation if he accepts the United job. The wing-back experiment could well be over, despite Southgate getting some joy from a similar set-up at the 2018 World Cup and using it in his last tournament for England.",
      "It’s more likely Southgate will play a 4-3-2-1 or a 4-3-3, though his sides were characterised more by core principles as opposed to formation. His tactical philosophy largely revolved around protecting his backline with a double pivot sitting behind the No. 10, preferring games to be structured and slow rather than looking to press with intensity high up the pitch.",
      "After enduring a period on the bench following his arrival from Royal Antwerp in an £18.2million deal in the summer, Lammens has cemented himself as United’s number one and looks set to be the long-term successor to David de Gea in goal. Given how recently he was signed and how the Belgian has settled in, it’s unlikely that Southgate would prioritise signing a goalkeeper right away, although his former reliable Jordan Pickford may appeal to him.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, when fit, is one of United’s most integral players at the heart of the defence, given his ball-playing abilities and defensive leadership. Southgate would love to pair him up in central defence with Marc Guehi, who is out of contract at Crystal Palace in the summer.",
      "United would need a miracle to sign Guehi given his recent links to Manchester City and Liverpool, although Southgate has established a good relationship with the defender after making him a starter for England. Another of his trusted England defenders, Luke Shaw, would surely occupy the left-back position.",
      "That leaves another England international, Tino Livramento, as the perfect signing at right-back. The Newcastle defender has already been linked with an Old Trafford move and would be a highly-rated and versatile addition to their backline, capable of also filling in at left-back.",
      "Notable omissions here are captain Bruno Fernandes and boyhood Red Kobbie Mainoo. Fernandes has been a great servant to United but it appears increasingly likely he will soon cut his losses in Manchester and sign a lucrative contract in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Summer signing Matheus Cunha is a like-for-like replacement in the No.10 position. Southgate handed Mainoo his England debut and, depending on the opposition, could rotate him with Cunha and Mason Mount, who epitomises Southgate’s style of football.",
      "Joining Mainoo in the pivot or playing as a lone six with Mount and Cunha in a dream scenario would be Elliot Anderson, who has become one of United’s top targets in recent months. Anderson, now a starter for England as well as Nottingham Forest, could be the signing they have needed since failing to bring in Declan Rice several seasons ago.",
      "However, the energetic midfielder could fetch a sum as high as £100m in the summer, with the likes of City also reportedly interested in him.",
      "Harry Kane and Gareth Southgate enjoyed an incredible relationship during their years working together for England. Kane, who is enjoying a world-class season at Bayern Munich, insists he’s happy in Germany, but Southgate being in charge at United may be the push he needs to return to the Premier League and break Alan Shearer’s goal-scoring record.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been one of United’s better players since he signed in the summer, operating from his favoured right flank with Amad playing the role of back-up. That presents a huge opportunity for Marcus Rashford to return to the fold after his falling out with former boss Amorim forced him out on loan to Aston Villa and now Barcelona.",
      "It’s still unclear whether Barcelona will activate their option-to-buy clause at the end of this season. Should he return to his boyhood club, Southgate would be just the man to help Rashford fulfil his potential in Manchester.",

      "Manchester United could be about to see the best of Bruno Fernandes once again should Ole Gunnar Solskjaer be appointed as the club's caretaker manager for a second time.",
      "Solskjaer, 52, who was in temporary charge for 17 matches in 2018/19 before he was made permanent, is the frontrunner to take charge for the remainder of the season after Ruben Amorim was sacked. And the Norwegian is handed the job, Fernandes is someone that would benefit.",
      "The former Besiktas and Molde boss brought Fernandes to United from Sporting CP in February 2020 and it's safe to say he got the best out of the attacking midfielder. Indeed, the Portugal international scored 44 goals and provided 35 assists in 97 matches under Solskjaer, averaging a goal or assist every 1.22 matches.",
      "His output has dropped since Solskjaer left United in November 2021, with Fernandes producing a goal or assist every 1.77 games instead. He has directly contributed to 119 goals in the 211 matches under Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Amorim - the four to take charge after Solskjaer was dismissed.",
      "Under Solskjaer, Fernandes was often utilised in the No.10 role behind the striker. This allowed him to get forward, create chances and get in amongst the goals. Scott McTominay and Fred were typically used as two defensive-minded midfielders with Fernandes in front and with license to go and attack.",
      "In truth, Solskjaer essentially built his United team around Fernandes. Data collected before the start of this season showed that, along with his direct goal and assist output dropping, Fernandes' chance creation fell. Key passes per 90 minutes slumped from 3.1 to 2.3, while his through balls decreased from 0.39 to 0.21.",
      "Fernandes' touches in the final third per 90 dropped from 28 to 23, too. It's clear that, while Fernandes has still produced consistently over the last four years, he hasn't been as productive since Solskjaer's exit with his role changing under numerous bosses.",
      "Solskjaer's United team relied on quick transitions and moments of individual brilliance, giving Fernandes a vast amount freedom to roam, take risks, and be the main creative spark.",
      "Since Solskjaer's exit, United have played in more structured build-up systems with more positional discipline, more shared creativity, and less chaos. Amorim, meanwhile, moved Fernandes back into a deeper No.8 position, a role that didn't see him go forward as much and stopped him from creating as many chances and scoring as many goals.",
      "According to talkSPORT, United captain Fernandes is backing the return of Solskjaer as the club's caretaker manager until the end of the season. He is the firm favourite to take over from Darren Fletcher, who is set to lead United out for Wednesday's trip to Burnley and the FA Cup game at home to Brighton on Wednesday.",
      "Solskjaer's first Premier League game in charge could be a mouth-watering clash against Manchester City at Old Trafford later this month. Solskjaer has won three and drawn one of his previous six fixtures against City.",

Evans retired as a player after his second spell at Old Trafford came to an end following the 2024/25 season. He went straight into a role as head of loans and pathway but left that position just a month ago.",

      "\"His assistant, Alan Wright, who newly joined the club as well, so the Under-21 staff come and join me.\"",
      "Fletcher will lead out United at Burnley in what is his first taste of senior management experience, but he is keen to make the occasion about the players rather than himself.",
      "United lacked an attacking identity under Amorim and Fletcher wants to see a side against the Clarets that supporters can be proud of.",
      "\"Well, hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me,\" he said. \"So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of. And I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.",
      "\"I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team. And I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves and to show that. And also to challenge them.",
      "\"It's about them, it's not about me. It's their season, it's their careers, it's their opportunity. I'm here to help them, but they're the ones who have to cross that white line and go on the pitch and make it happen. So give them some responsibility to go and do that.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a strong candidate to make a return to Manchester United on an interim basis until the end of the season after being pictured back in Cheshire today.",
      "Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021 after almost three years in charge. The former striker replaced Jose Mourinho at the end of 2018 as interim head coach, before being appointed to the job permanently in 2019.",
      "Solskjaer left Besiktas in August after the Turkish side crashed out of the Conference League. It's also understood that the Norwegian is now a strong contender to return to Old Trafford.",
      "The 52-year-old was pictured today at a Waitrose store in Wilmslow, Cheshire, near his home in the area. Solskjaer, who was a teammate of Darren Fletcher as a player, is being considered to take control of United until the end of the season.",
      "Solskjaer is emerging as a leading candidate, having made it clear he is desperate to return to the club. During his previous period in charge of the club, Solskjaer recorded successive top league finishes in the Premier League - the club's first since Sir Alex Ferguson - and reached the Europa League final, losing to Villarreal.",
      "He also led them to a second-placed finish in 2021, something only he and Mourinho have achieved since Ferguson retired in 2013. In his playing days, the former Cardiff City boss made more than 200 appearances, winning six Premier League titles and the famous treble in 1999.",
      "It's understood that United are pursuing an interim solution until the end of the season before finding a permanent head coach for the 2026/27 season. Fletcher is set to take charge of Wednesday night's Premier League clash with Burnley and Sunday's FA Cup game with Brighton.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

The 40-year-old was sacked within 24 hours of that press conference.",

      "Gary Neville has given his verdict on Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United, naming which match was the \"killer game\" for the club's former head coach. United announced on Monday that the club had parted ways with Amorim after 14 months in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim was recently asked about the confidence he received from United's hierarchy, where the 40-year-old gave a lengthy explanation on his role at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything,\" Amorim said after United’s draw with Leeds on Sunday. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "\"Look, if there was a meeting on Friday morning about the performance against Wolves between the sporting director and the manager - I'd actually have been disappointed if there wasn't a meeting after the Wolves performance,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I think as a sporting director or owner of a football club, you should be entitled to go and speak to a manager when the team have played like they have against Wolves and basically Wolves have picked up a point at Old Trafford, only their third of the season.",
      "\"It seems to me that in the last week, Ruben Amorim has decided that he doesn't feel supported or he doesn't feel happy, he's called it out obviously in press conferences, decided to unleash at times and sort of be emotional and do what he does: I think he's always been honest, he's always done it with integrity, he's always speaking from the heart - we always enjoy his press conferences.",
      "\"But the reality of it is, when you turn on your bosses - it doesn't matter whether you're at a football club or you work in Morrisons - if you turn on your bosses, you're not going to keep your job very long.",
      "\"For me, the meeting between Jason Wilcox and Ruben Amorim after the Wolves game that took place, that absolutely would take place in every single football club.",
      "\"If Salford City had a game that they lost or drew that was bad, there would be a conversation between the sporting department and the manager, just like there would be from the manager to the sporting department if we weren't getting our targets in the January transfer window.",
      "\"These are conversations that have to happen, there has to be a level of honesty that occurs when there are disappointing results.",
      "\"Over the last five or six weeks, I've done probably every United game other than the Leeds and Crystal Palace games, and I've actually complimented United when I think they've performed well: against Bournemouth, when they drew 4-4, against Villa when they lost was a disappointing result but I thought there was something in the performance.",
      "\"But some of the performances in the last month... if you look at the Everton game, losing to 10 men when to be fair Ruben Amorim kept three at the back against one and they were basically trying to chase a goal against 10-man Everton.",
      "\"The performance against West Ham - everyone is beating West Ham and Manchester United drew at home and to be fair West Ham could've got more out of the game. Everyone is beating Wolves, Manchester United drew against Wolves.",
      "\"So if you look at some of the performances in the last month, they've been shocking. However, there have been some bright spots along the way.",
      "\"I actually thought against Leeds it was a decent performance, I thought it was a good point and he could have handled it differently after the game in the press conference but he didn't. The Wolves game to me seemed like the killer game, it was a bad one.\"",
      "Neville then turned to where United must go next after Amorim’s sacking, and why he was surprised by the departure.",
      "\"When a manager is sacked at any level - and obviously I'm a part-owner in a football club - it's a poor reflection on everybody; it means it's not worked, it means the decision-making all the way through has not been successful, it means the manager has not won enough football matches and that ultimately everybody loses,” Neville said.",
      "\"Particularly when you're sacking a manager part-way through a season it's difficult to get an adequate replacement in.",
      "\"Manchester United have been here before. They're in a challenging position again. I am surprised it's happened this morning; I'm not surprised it's happened.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I didn't realise it would happen so quickly. I think the last week or so, some of the press conferences that we've seen, it only ends one way. But I did think that they would get through another couple of weeks, try and work out what to do.",
      "\"But obviously it's become that challenging internally that they've decided to do it, which was a shock this morning at 10 o'clock when I heard the news.\"",

The Portugal international has been one of United's most influential players both on and of the pitch since his arrival from Sporting CP in 2020.",
      "Not only the captain of the first-team under Amorim, Fernandes was also part of a six-man core leadership group alongside Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Noussair Mazraoui and Tom Heaton last year.",

      "Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, less than 19 hours after a remarkable press conference at Elland Road in which he demanded more power and told director of football Jason Wilcox to \"do his job\". Tensions between Amorim and members of the football leadership team, including Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, have become public in recent weeks and Amorim laid them bare at Elland Road.",
      "His stunning remarks left nobody in any doubt that were issues behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Amorim's job came under immediate scrutiny and after what was essentially a 'back me or sack me' plea, his 63-game reign was brought to an end on Monday.",
      "But United sources insist that the decision was made solely on results and denied there had been any power struggles or that Amorim had laid down an ultimatum demanding more power. They insist the 40-year-old maintained the 'unwavering support' of everyone within the club but there hadn't been enough progress for him to continue in the role.",
      "Amorim had been frustrated at being told there was no money to spend in January and was keen to add a midfielder to his squad, with United initially showing interest in attacker Antoine Semenyo before tightening the purse strings.",
      "The decision was made to sign three attacking players last summer, in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, as well as goalkeeper Senne Lammens, and United insist Amorim was on board with that recruitment plan and happy with the decision to strengthen the attack over the midfield.",
      "In his press conference after the Leeds draw, Amorim had demanded to be the manager at United rather than the coach, even though his job title since his appointment in November 2024 was head coach. United have no plans to change that structure and their next appointment is likely to have to accept the same job title.",
      "United sources point out that the £250million spent since Amorim's arrival made the club one of the highest spenders in the Premier League in that time. Although the team have shown signs of improvement this season and sit sixth in the Premier League, the decision has been made to axe Amorim to give the squad a better chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season.",

Fletcher will take his first proper session on Tuesday before holding a press conference to preview the trip to Turf Moor. Although he has no senior management experience, he was part of Erik ten Hag's first-team staff and made 342 appearances for the club as a player.",
      "United sources contrasted that level of experience with Chelsea's caretaker boss, Calum McFarlane, who stepped up from academy football in the wake of Enzo Maresca's sacking.",
      "That is why there is faith in Fletcher to guide the club through a tricky period as chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox consider their options. Although a permanent appointment could be made now, there is a feeling that it might make sense to wait until the end of the season, when the field of candidates could be greater. That could lead to a caretaker being appointed until the end of the season.",

      "England international Guehi had all-but signed for Liverpool before the plug was pulled on a deal at the 11th hour.",
      "While such actions may serve as a warning to United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, Amorim's words may also serve as a caution to Glasner, as well.",
      "The Portuguese recently vented over his inability to play his preferred formation, with Glasner also preferring to play with three central defenders.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play our perfect 3-4-3, that we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" Amorim said. \"I'm starting to understand that's not going to happen. So, maybe now I have to adapt.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

    "body": [
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Dan Ashworth might have celebrated after Ruben Amorim was sacked by Man Utd, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox are in trouble.",
      "Amorim was finally shown the door after 63 largely forgettable games in charge at Old Trafford, with the beneficiaries and casualties of his demise fairly easy to delineate.",
      "",
      "When Amorim referred to Mainoo as “the future of Manchester United” in December, he added that the England international simply “needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days”.",
      "Mainoo, at a crucial period in his development, had already sat tightly enough for an opportunity which was not forthcoming. Not 18 months have passed since he started a European Championship final, which itself came a few weeks after his match-winning turn in the FA Cup final. Yet only against Grimsby has the 20-year-old been entrusted with longer than 45 minutes in any game this season.",
      "Through such curious treatment Mainoo has kept his counsel – and for one regrettable exception ensured his entourage did the same – with a clean slate post-Amorim surely his reward.",
      "No-one stands to benefit more from the departure of Amorim than the gifted academy graduate whose overdue invite back in from the bitter cold can help address glaring problems in that Manchester United midfield.",
      "It is thought that he could ‘benefit most’ from the interim appointment of Darren Fletcher in what will presumably be a short-term arrangement, with “the future of Manchester United” finally allowed to play a part in the present again.",
      "",
      "It is exceptional work that of the ‘hell of a brains trust’ held responsible for appointing Amorim at Manchester United, the only dissenting voice was dispensed with over a year before his concerns over the suitability of the Portuguese were fully realised.",
      "A penny for Ashworth’s thoughts would be a drop in the ocean considering the £4.1m pay-off he landed after serving a longer period of gardening leave at Newcastle than he did actually working in the fabled Old Trafford power structure.",
      "That difference of opinion over whether Amorim was the best possible fit was ultimately his undoing. Ashworth suggested there might be better appointments out there than a tactically obstinate coach whose ideals clashed with the composition of a squad which could hardly afford to have more money spent on it, especially in the middle of a season.",
      "INEOS disagreed, ousted their sporting director, spent around £250m on signings for Amorim and then sacked him while Ashworth was settling into his new role in charge of ‘strategic oversight’ and ‘building long-term systems’ at the FA, where he established his reputation for precisely the sort of structure-led executive vision Manchester United need – the kind they had and ignored.",
      "",
      "“The Club” might never have been as thoroughly, fundamentally “known” as by the former player, ambassador, reserve team and first-team striker coach, caretaker and full-time manager who has represented them on the pitch or in the dugout 534 times.",
      "It should be with an acceptance that Rio Ferdinand cannot propose, regardless of results or performances, that Solskjaer is offered a blank contract to fill and sign. And that Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are legally prevented from referring to the Norwegian only by his first name.",
      "But Manchester United absolutely have to put Ole at the wheel again. If for no other reason than the fact Darren Fletcher is taking his turn, Ruud van Nistelrooy had one last season and Ryan Giggs has to be skipped over, even if doing so is as hard as a totem pole.",
      "It is already shameful that Manchester United are back in the same sort of position Solskjaer inherited seven years ago, so they really might as well make the best of it.",
      "And after 14 months of sacrificing their modesty, pride and dignity at the altar of a stubborn philosophical and tactical egotist, Manchester United probably do need a supporter to stroke their hair, tell them they’re beautiful, wait on them hand and foot and regale them with stories about “Sir Alex” for half a season.",
      "It is objectively hilarious that Solskjaer finds himself as the saviour rushing to help someone he actively knows doesn’t see him in the same way, but also completely fair play because it guarantees someone who has previously only ever managed Molde, Cardiff and Besiktas semi-regular work at Manchester United.",
      "",
      "It is almost two years since they sold a 27.7 per cent stake, and with it control over football operations at Manchester United, and it genuinely feels like the Glazers would not have made half as many atrocious decisions.",
      "",
      "He got to do the ‘three trophies’ thing again! Genuinely chuffed for him. But slightly worried he didn’t refer to his greatest career achievement of finishing second.",
      "",
      "There is an argument to suggest Amorim is better off now than at any previous point over the past year or so.",
      "He has certainly somehow engineered a situation whereby taking Manchester United to 15th, bottling a major final against Spurs and spending hundreds of millions to continue overseeing really quite turgid football has nevertheless not damaged his reputation nearly as much as it should, and that he has been as much a victim of the club’s mess than a culprit.",
      "But this can only have been a chastening experience for a man who was among the world’s most promising, exciting, charismatic and captivating young coaches upon his appointment at 39. When Amorim turns 41 at the end of January it will have been a hell of a paper round.",
      "And consider this list of the roles the permanent post-Ferguson managers sacked by Manchester United took up next:",
      "Real Sociedad (six months later)\nNetherlands (five years and two months later)\nSpurs (11 months later)\nBesiktas (three years and two months later)\nBayer Leverkusen (eight months later)",
      "It is bleak reading for a manager who could have had his pick of jobs had he called Omar Berrada’s risible bluff.",
      "",
      "Take your pick of damning quote.",
      "For some, it’ll be the one from October when Ratcliffe said “Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,” before sacking him within three months.",
      "Back then he said “football is not overnight” and that “we have to be patient, we have a long-term plan, it isn’t a light switch and you can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions”.",
      "Manchester United are fifth in a form table since those comments, which were made when they were 10th.",
      "Others might prefer Ratcliffe’s “best in class, 10 out of 10s” description of those he wanted to put in key executive roles at Old Trafford, which currently include a director of football whose only previous experience in such a job came in a single season in the Championship with Southampton.",
      "In that same interview Ratcliffe did also say that INEOS had “made mistakes in football so I’m really pleased that we made them before we arrived in Manchester United” so it really might be that one.",
      "But there is also an argument for when Ratcliffe said the Manchester United shot-callers would decide “what the style of football is and that will be the Manchester United style of football. And the coach will have to play that style,” before specifically appointing a coach who did not play that style.",
      "Ratcliffe has made an absurd number of gloriously bad calls while sat in the big chair; that he has done so while furiously messaging Wilcox about changing formation and playing Bryan Mbeumo at wing-back makes it no less hilarious.",
      "",
      "And to the man himself, who wields an inexplicable degree of power at one of the biggest clubs in world football because billionaire owners see ‘Manchester City’ on someone’s LinkedIn and automatically believe they have found a cheat code everyone else has overlooked.",
      "Wilcox was academy director at the Etihad for six years and director of football for Southampton in the Championship for one, before he was given the keys to the Manchester United clown car and some scribbled directions which read ‘Step 1, spend millions. Step 5, knock everyone off perch’, with the middle pages torn out and eaten by David Gill.",
      "Of course, Wilcox was a player and coach before that. In fact, he referred to himself as “a coach at heart” during a Q&A in September, adding: “That’s a strength in my role now but also causes me a bit of a problem because I always want to interfere in what the managers are doing.”",
      "The explosive meeting which effectively sealed Amorim’s fate can only really be viewed through that prism.",
      "And while those inside stories on the Portuguese’s demise underline how Wilcox has inherited Ed Woodward’s contacts book and innate control over the narrative – the importance of which should not be overlooked – they also emphasise how inextricably tied he is to Amorim’s appointment, failure and sacking, and how Manchester United picked a 3-4-3 fundamentalist before turning against him for playing too much 3-4-3.",
      "It is one thing backing Russell Martin for a second-tier promotion push and adorning him with a few Premier League loanees and Manchester City academy alumni, and entirely another making decisions designed to help actual Manchester United navigate their way through a crippling decade-long identity crisis to become legitimate elite trophy contenders again.",
      "Wilcox must have discovered that post-haste, not that he will say so publicly. Not that he will say much at all publicly, unless Manchester United are doing vaguely okay.",
      "That was the case around the time of Amorim’s one-year anniversary in charge when, in the midst of a genuinely unprecedented run of three Premier League wins and a draw, Wilcox implored the club to “continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben’s idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea. It’s a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for.”",
      "Two months later, Wilcox was one of those who made the decision to sack Amorim in large part because of an inflexibility over his ideas. He will not be able to avoid the axe covered in his own fingerprints forever if the next appointment isn’t a success.",
      "",
      "The streak goes on. De Ligt will still never have started consecutive professional club seasons under the same head coach until 2027/28 at the earliest.",
      "To have had 18 different managers at the age of 26, and to have made more than 42 appearances under only one by virtue of having worked with them at two clubs, is remarkable. At this point it’s De Ligt’s responsibility to maintain that until he retires.",
      "",
      "Fewer spaces, innit? Although they won’t be habitually subbed off on the hour of every game so that’s something.",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United star has reached an ‘agreement’ to leave the club this month, though this deal hinges on one condition.",
      "According to reports, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has indicated his ‘decision’ to INEOS as he is desperate to return to Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "Man Utd co-owners INEOS are looking to appoint a new sporting director after making the decision to sack Ruben Amorim on Monday, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has been criticised by Craig Burley over his comments about Ruben Amorim’s potential successor.",
      "Ruben Amorim has irked one BBC journalist by not letting him watch him work, while a ‘peculiar’ training tactic is revealed."

      "Problems are relative though and while United are sixth in the table, Burnley sit 19th and are sleepwalking towards relegation.",

      "Burnley are looking like a lost cause under Parker and even their promising early-season home form has evaporated.",

      "Now, two more managers have got new January jobs but identifying a clearly achievable goal for either is a far harder task than with Moyes at Everton.",
      "Liam Rosenior has been given a laughable six-and-a-half-year deal at Chelsea having swapped desks in the BlueCo organisation while Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins at Manchester United, albeit it on a temporary basis.",
      "Keeping the seat warm for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is some mission.",
      "Those two jobs are some of the most coveted in England and the world, but which is more appealing? Here’s a look at what Rosenior and the new United boss faces.",
      "",
      "Let’s start with Chelsea.",
      "The Stamford Bridge club are owned by BlueCo, a primarily US-based consortium that was founded in 2022 to purchase Chelsea after Roman Abramovich was forced to sell. They are a multi-club group ownership having also purchased Strasbourg in 2023.",
      "The chairman, and most public figure, is Todd Boehly while Behdad Eghbali is among the directors. While Boehly is often the man blamed for Chelsea’s latest mess, Eghbali is the one calling the shots and reportedly the man who was in constant disagreement with Enzo Maresca.",
      "The MO of BlueCo has always been to buy some of the best young players in the world and then give them long contracts to amortise the costs and comply with PSR. Since BlueCo took over in 2022, no Premier League club has spent more money with around £1.49bn spent.",
      "Given BlueCo only took over in 2022, the ultimate end goal of that project has yet to become clear. Are they looking to sell these players on for profit? Or do they believe they can win Premier League titles in three or four years’ time?",
      "At Manchester United, things are not too dissimilar. In February 2024, Jim Ratcliffe’s INEOS spent £1.3bn to take 29% of the club away from the Glazer family. While the Glazers continue to sit back and watch the dollars flow into their bank account, Ratcliffe has taken over football operations.",
      "He appointed Omar Berrada as CEO, who previously worked for Manchester City owners the City Football Group while Jason Wilcox is director of football.",
      "It is with Wilcox that Ruben Amorim reportedly had mounting disagreements, particularly when it came to transfers and the team’s tactical set-up.",
      "While United’s hierarchy is perhaps not as dictatorial as Chelsea’s, it is expected that any new manager will have to appease Wilcox and Berrada if they are to stay in the job. United’s board also appear to cut their manager a bit more slack. Maresca left after saying he endured the worst ‘48 hours’ of his Chelsea career while Amorim was allowed a 15th-place finish, embarrassing cup exit to Grimsby and describing the team as the worst in the club’s history.",
      "",
      "Squad-wise, Chelsea are marginally better – look at the league table – but there are problems to be fixed for both sides.",
      "United’s is currently a mix of good but ageing players and young talents still lacking experience. Senne Lammens has shored up the long-troubled area of goalkeeper but the use of Ayden Heaven in recent weeks has highlighted how injury-prone United’s main central defenders can be.",
      "In midfield, both Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are not getting any younger and Amorim’s insistence on strengthening this area is what reportedly cost him his job. A new manager may have a higher opinion of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Up front, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have brought much-needed freshness but Joshua Zirkzee and Benjamin Sesko remain unconvincing.",
      "For Chelsea, they play exactly like what they are – a young squad full of potential but lacking the experience to be consistent.",
      "Moises Caicedo is one of the best midfielders in the league along with Enzo Fernandez, while Estevao looks like a star in the making. Cole Palmer is a former Player of the Year but struggled in 2025 and they have a lot of good if not great options up front in Pedro Neto, Jamie Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "At the back, it is very youth-focused with Tosin Adarabioyo being the oldest member at 28.",
      "All of that is to say that Chelsea’s squad have a lot of potential; it is just about how a new manager can get the best out of that and whether a more seasoned veteran is needed for others to flourish.",
      "MORE ON CHELSEA AND UNITED ON F365\n* Liam Rosenior is BlueCo’s Chelsea yes man, even if he absolutely insists he isn’t\n* Steve Bruce return request is why ex-Man Utd players are helping to keep the club trapped in purgatory\n* Man Utd ‘in favour of a new sporting director’ as Wilcox future becomes unclear after Amorim sack",
      "",
      "When it comes to history, there is no debate. Manchester United are one of the most successful teams in the history of football with the trophy room to show for it.",
      "Chelsea did win trophies before Abramovich’s takeover but they had only been league champions once before the Russian came in. The vast majority of their trophies, especially the more prestigious ones, have come this century.",
      "In more recent years, Chelsea have become the more successful club with two Champions League wins since United last won the trophy and the same number of league titles. A Club World Cup and Conference League trophy completed the set for the London side and there is a reasonable debate to be had that Chelsea have been the most consistently successful English club of the 21st century.",
      "But the lure of United, along with its millions of fans, is the possibility of being the first league-winning manager since Ferguson.",
      "Football managers have often got themselves into this position by having an unshakeable self-belief and so, even if there is plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise, they will believe they can be the one that ‘fixes’ United.",
      "Chelsea may be stronger on paper both in terms of squad and recent success, but it is that aspect that may sway a potential manager over to United.",
      "",
      "If you ask either club what their expectations are, the stock answer is ‘win the league’ because neither can be seen to be aiming for anything less. But in reality, a few spots below the top place would enable a manager to stay in post.",
      "Of the two, the bar would appear to be higher at Chelsea. They have qualified for the Champions League in five of the last seven seasons and so simply finishing top four is perhaps not good enough. For Liam Rosenior arriving in mid-season, ensuring that is a must for this campaign but that expectation will be raised next year.",
      "For a United manager, Champions League qualification, and the money that comes with it, would be a seen as success having done so just once in the past four years. Fletcher or Solskjaer stand a good chance of doing that with the club three points off Liverpool.",
      "How they go about that also comes with expectations. Chelsea have a mode of business that relies on a manager getting the best out of young players and so Rosenior will have to accept that. The good news is that they are willing to get their chequebook out, albeit not for established world stars.",
      "For United, it remains to be seen how much influence Wilcox and Berrada will seek to have post-Amorim with the Portuguese mostly given carte blanche. Until he didn’t. Transfer-wise, it seems to be a case of you will get what you’re given for both clubs.",
      "",

      "Roberto De Zerbi is very interested in becoming the next permanent manager of Manchester United, with sources indicating the Marseille boss sees the Old Trafford role as an ideal next step in his career – and we can reveal the Italian is ready to leave France at the end of the season if offered the job.",
      "The 46-year-old, who previously impressed in the Premier League with Brighton & Hove Albion, is said to be enthusiastic about a potential move. Insiders claim De Zerbi feels ready for a major challenge and is particularly drawn to the prospect of another stint in English football, where his attacking philosophy earned widespread acclaim.",
      "Manchester United‘s current approach plays perfectly into this scenario. Following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim after just 14 months in charge, the club has opted for an interim solution for the remainder of the season, delaying a permanent appointment until the summer. This timeline suits De Zerbi’s situation at Marseille, where he remains under contract until 2027, but would be open to discussions if a prestigious opportunity arises.",
      "However, they do face some competition as sources have stated that Tottenham have De Zerbi down as a candidate to replace Thomas Frank. The Danish manager will be assessed at the end of the season, and if they do not feel enough progress is made, Spurs could also be in the market for a new manager. The Italian is amongst the thoughts of those at the club.",
      "De Zerbi’s name, though, also carries significant weight within United’s decision-making structure under INEOS.",
      "He was interviewed by Manchester United representatives in 2024 as they considered alternatives to Erik ten Hag, highlighting long-standing admiration for his methods. That internal support persists, with sources suggesting key figures at Old Trafford continue to view him as a strong candidate capable of implementing an exciting, progressive style of play.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "During his time at Brighton, De Zerbi guided the Seagulls to their highest-ever Premier League finish and European qualification, showcasing his ability to maximise resources and develop players.",
      "Pundits have echoed this praise, while my sources now state he is seen as a top choice to succeed Amorim at Old Trafford alongside Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner.",
      "I reported on Monday how the Austrian was seen by INEOS as the outstanding choice to succeed the Portuguese. And while he too favours a three-man defensive line, he has shown more tactical flexibility and is not adverse to reverting to a 4-3-3 system, which many feels suits the players within the Old Trafford squad.",
      "While other names have emerged as contenders, De Zerbi’s prior Premier League success and existing backing inside the club position him prominently on the shortlist.",
      "For United fans frustrated by recent turbulence, the idea of De Zerbi’s bold, possession-dominant approach could signal a fresh era.",
      "As the club stabilises under interim management, all eyes will be on the summer when the pursuit of their next leader intensifies. Strong sources state that the feeling appears mutual – De Zerbi is ready and willing to answer the call.",
      "Get the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim’s treatment of six Man Utd players is reported to have caused serious ructions behind the scenes at Old Trafford and is now believed to have been a serious factor in his removal as manager.",
      "However, the 40-year-old’s dismissal has seen him offered a bucket-load of sympathy in the Portuguese media, with several publications directing their anger at both the players and those behind the scenes – and in particular Wilcox.",
      "Despite that, the removal of Amorim as manager appears to have come too late to prevent Joshua Zirkzee from pushing through his wish to leave Old Trafford.",
      "Per our sources, Roma have been informed by the Dutchman’s representatives that he still wants to move to the Italian capital, and with fresh talks over a deal planned this week."

There’s no way he could go straight from the Manchester United Clown Festival to working for a serious organisation like Morrisons. The senior management talent gap between Man U and Morrisons would be too big for him to negotiate at this stage in his career.\nBen Teacher",

In almost fifty league matches, he only won three times by more than one goal. He leaves with a negative six goal difference. That is hilariously bad, and should have seen any manager in world football – much less one at a ‘big club’ – looking for new work.",
      "Secondly, he’s clearly been fired not because of the above, but because he offended one or more snowflakes in the United hierarchy. And that’s the worst bit for me. We were told, after being at the whim of the Glazers’ utter disregard for football for a decade, that INEOS were serious people, who’d bring in best-in-class professionals. But the way this has transpired screams to me of insecure men who’ve been promoted above their ability and can’t take the finger being pointed back at them.",
      "Very few managers last even as long as he did. United as a club desperately need to get away from the ‘saviour-manager’ and just get a good coach in, who can make the most of what is available. There is not another Fergie out there. But that doesn’t mean that this team, and this squad, shouldn’t be playing much better and delivering much better results than it is.",

      "Man U are at least 2 managers away from anything close to their former glories, and have been since Ferguson left.

Had Amorim been a bit less wedded to his system, he might well have fit the bill here. They need to do it soon too, before they are forced to by those noodle and tractor partners finally removing their sponsorship deals.",
      "Ian H makes a good point regarding bulletproof and overly controlling hierarchies too, which brings me to my last point – I’ve heard Unai Emery’s name touted a lot today. Why would he leave a club that he has purring largely because he has Fergie-like levels of control, for 2026 Man U where he will have very little and an inferior squad?",
      "Sporting directors are a great idea in theory, but there’s a finite supply of managers period, let alone enough who are willing to cede that much control, fit whatever the chosen playing style is, AND bring success. Emery is living proof that something closer to the old ways can still work.\nRHT/TS x",

At this stage of the game, I can say with maximum confidence that nobody knows English football better than the man himself, that’s Southgate. He has acquired and exhibited thorough knowledge and understanding of the EPL, clearly manifest in his roles as player, club Manager and National team Manager.",
      "The point must further be made that Southgate has demonstrated flexibility, willingness and ability to make changes and deliver effective tactics, evident in taking England to the finals of the Euro competition. A sine qua non for achieving success in football is the relationship between the Manager and the players. The Manager and players interrelationships, by and large, impact the performance of the team.",

      "I’d rather Howe left on his terms than be sacked given what he’s done for the club – he’ll always be a legend. I’d love to see him develop and change at Newcastle and prove the doubters (including me) wrong but football rarely rewards romanticism.",
      "As a Newcastle fan I think we are at a tipping point where Howe will have lived long enough to become the villain. The majority of fans are onside but there is a growing minority who are now sensing that tactically he’s peaked and he cannot escape the blame for such a lot of money (£100m+) spent on dross like Ramsey and Elanga. His focus on building an entire team of athletes/runners with no guile or flair becomes more obvious with time, but he could achieve a real bounce at Utd and get them back up the table.",
      "Howe’s approach would suit Utd’s fans and to a large degree could work with the players they have. Cunha, Mbuemo and Sesko were all wanted by Howe in the summer so he has already done his homework and won’t need a massive squad overhaul.",
      "Howe’s man-management style could work at United who I don’t think have had since Ole a manager who was really in tune with the players. If Bruno F is onside he’s an excellent player and Utd have the kind of sh*thouses Howe likes to have.",
      "Where it gets murkier is whether the Utd players are prepared to work as hard as Howe demands, and whether they have the legs/athleticism to play this ‘Intensity is our Identity’ way. Howe will also want the kind of control he’s gained at Newcastle on transfers, which seems to be where Amorim eventually crossed the line to be sacked, but he wouldn’t need the root and branch change Amorim wanted.",
      "I don’t think Howe will move mid-season. Despite a lot of quite poor performances Newcastle are well placed in all four competitions – can progress in the CL to the play-offs, home draw in the FA Cup, tough two legged tie with City in the Carabao but they are not invincible, and a few decent results will see them climb the table quickly.",

      "",
      "Let the deluge of memes and bile flow but at the heart of it, Amorim has played Sirs Jim, Wilcox and Berrada like three tarnished magnets on a tactics board. And to the tune of a massive payout no less. An absolute masterclass of an exit… possibly inspired by what transpired New Year’s Day in West London or what unrequited opportunity could now beckon in East London (one Portuguese legend for another), who knows.",
      "Anyhow if he hasn’t already, Ruben could enter storied Manchester folklore by Robin Hooding some of that sweet, sweet bunce back to the soup lady and SAF and all the poor folks Ratcliffe kicked to the curb in the name of efficiency and club virtue.\nEric, Los Angeles CA (Just how springy is a Darren Fletcher bounce ?)",
      "",
      "With so many teams struggling to string together a run of performances (like Villa’s recent surge shows), it’s clear that even 6th place, only 4 points above 15th, is pretty underwhelming, given the summer investment and all that extra time to train and prepare while not playing in Europe. It’s hard to empathize with Amorim, who said earlier this season that he was the coach. He also said not even the Pope could change his mind.",
      "But you do have to wonder how much ‘meddling’ into team selection and tactics was coming from the shadows of the ‘back room’ staff. Especially those that never have to front up to the cameras. Apparently, it’s pretty common for Directors of Football to speak publicly in many other major leagues.",
      "Regardless, it’s such a poor look on the sports guru that is Sir Jim. All his marginal gains, by cutting staff, staff lunches, etc., while squandering millions on managers and sporting directors. Results looking pretty bleak for a ‘Top 6’ club. Nothing marginal there.",
      "When checking whether the ’new manager bounce’ is a thing, one report indicated it works in about 75% of cases, with teams averaging 1.4 to 1.8 points more over the next 5 or 6 games. If true, perhaps teams should change managers every 6 games.",
      "But for firing Amorim in essentially the same week as Chelsea canning Maresca will create such a wonderful litmus test of how these two basket-case clubs fare over the rest of the season. Chelsea has form (under the old regime) for replacing managers and continuing to excel. Utd, not so much – possibly a proper new manager slump. Interesting days ahead.\nPaul McDevitt",
      "",
      "I was disappointed to see a major absence in the winners and losers column this week: Mainoo.",
      "Surely, if anyone is a winner from Amorim’s delightfully acrimonious departure it’s him (and maybe Amad if he can be released back to an attacking role again). You’d have to expect that it means he can finally get games without having to go to Italy or Turkey where everything will come with an asterisk.",
      "Second – and while I say this with a wink, you know I want it too – Rashford. We know Barca will not be able to find the money for him, in spite of him being loved by Flick and doing good work. So when he comes back, maybe it’s to a manager that actually knows how to use him. Would boil so much piss of course, which is a bonus.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "While I’m all for your clickbaity lists, ranking Erik Ten Hag fourth behind Solskjaer is interesting. I mean, everyone is entitled to their opinion and no one is denying that Ten Hag’s second season was awful and even the FA Cup fig leaf did not preserve any modesty, but factually – looking at win percentage – at 51.8% Ten Hag is only second to Mourinho and this includes results from his second season.",
      "A second season where due to injuries we started with 29 different back fours in 38 games in front of a new, error-prone goalkeeper. One might plausibly say that such intense disruption in defense in front of a goalkeeper who is new to the country, league and club prevented the goalkeeper from settling in and added to the nerves and confusion in an ever changing defence and the real question is with such chaos and negativity, how did he still manage to finish in the top half with 60 points (which incidentally is better than Amorim was on course to get with 31 points from 20 games)?",
      "Don’t get me wrong, Ten Hag wasn’t the perfect manager. I didn’t like his public criticism of Sancho, even if it was possibly merited. His reliance on certain players who weren’t performing was an issue and his scouting was mediocre.",
      "This said, during his second season the problems were massively overblown considering the injury crisis we faced and, where at other clubs leeway seems to be given for injuries, the circus surrounding Man Utd, the negativity, the constant will he/won’t he be sacked all took on a life of its own really and sucked the confidence out of the players.",
      "Ultimately, something needed to change and that change was the manager, but the idea that Solskjaer was a better manager than Ten Hag is absurd, especially when Ten Hag won two trophies compared to Solskjaer’s zero – the FA Cup Final being particularly impressive against league winners Man City.\nDaniel, Cambridge"

      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Newcastle manager Eddie Howe have responded to rumours they could replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd.",
      "The Red Devils revealed on Monday morning that they had sacked Amorim after a 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday with Darren Fletcher taking charge of their next game versus Burnley.",
      "Amorim came out after the match with a rant directed towards the board and his doubters before being sacked less than 24 hours later.",
      "Reports have claimed that Man Utd made the decision to sack Amorim before the Leeds fixture after he fell out with director of football Jason Wilcox over formations and recruitment.",
      "Man Utd are now likely to appoint an interim manager to follow Fletcher until the end of the season with the decision on a permanent successor to be taken in the summer.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano told his YouTube channel: “Man Utd have taken the decision to dismiss Ruben Amorim with immediate effect and the club are now assessing their next steps, with a strong possibility of appointing a caretaker manager until the end of the season before moving for a permanent solution in the summer.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Ruben Amorim ‘quirk’ revealed as he refused BBC entry to training!",
      "“That said, Man Utd may still explore opportunities in the market and could decide to appoint a permanent manager immediately, depending on the options available. The club will take time to evaluate the situation before making a final call.”",
      "Romano also clarified Amorim’s contract situation and rumours that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be his temporary replacement at Man Utd.",
      "He added: “It is important to clarify the situation regarding Ruben Amorim. This was a club decision, not a resignation. Amorim remains under contract with Man Utd until 2027, meaning the club will continue to pay his salary unless another club negotiates an exit in the coming months.",
      "“Amorim had publicly stated that he would not resign, and less than 24 hours later the club chose to end his tenure.",
      "“In the short term, Darren Fletcher is expected to be on the touchline for the upcoming midweek fixtures. Regarding rumours from England, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be open to returning as caretaker manager and would be willing to help the club if asked. However, there is no decision yet, either on a caretaker or on the permanent managerial appointment, which remains the most crucial choice.",
      "“Internal discussions are ongoing as Man Utd decide their next step following Amorim’s dismissal.”",
      "Plenty of names have been bandied about over the last 24 hours with both Crystal Palace’s Glasner and Newcastle’s Howe among the names mentioned.",
      "When asked about being favourite to take over at Old Trafford, Glasner said on Tuesday: “I’m not allowed to bet. I don’t look at it. I’m Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask me any more questions about it.”",
      "Newcastle head coach Howe was asked if anything could tempt him away from St James’ Park amid Amorim’s sacking at Man Utd, to which he replied: “No. Not at this current time.",
      "“The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships that I have with the people around me.",
      "“That has not always been consistently good. Things can change at any football club, but I’m very happy at the moment.”",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola hailed Amorim as a “top manager” after hearing the news of his sacking at Man Utd and wished him “all the best in the future”.",
      "Guardiola said in his Friday press conference: “It’s a fact [that managers now get] less time, I know. Like what happened with Enzo.",
      "“I cannot say anything for respect for the players and for the institution, Chelsea, United. Only I can say the same. Rúben is a top manager, so decisions have been made for our neighbours, so I wish him, Rúben, all the best in the future.”",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has reportedly been identified as the top target to replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd with four names on their list.",

      "According to reports, Chelsea have opted to ‘make a move’ for Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe as a potential replacement for Enzo Maresca.",
      "Pep Guardiola has revealed he has “no idea” if Enzo Maresca has had talks about taking the Manchester City job, as he spoke on his own future at the club.",
      "Enzo Maresca rocking up at Newcastle, with Frank Lampard replacing him at Chelsea, has been forecasted for a 2026 which will end with Arsenal as champions.",

      "Here’s Simon Stone of the BBC:",
      "Amorim had a few quirks, but most coaches do.",
      "When United opened their doors for the first 15 minutes of training the day before European games, it was strange to see Amorim watch the sprints and rondos on a different pitch – sometimes 50 yards away, and far removed from his coaching staff.",
      "He was far more involved – whistle in hand – when the sessions began, though he wasn’t keen to let the media into those.",
      "And that’s a ‘quirk’? That he did not take part in the circus of the 15-minute open training sessions that are specifically designed to reveal absolutely nothing to the watching media? And then he ‘wasn’t keen’ to allow the media to watch actual training? Weirdo.",
      "There was a full open session in Malaysia on United’s post-season trip in May, but that whole expedition was not run on fully professional lines given the amount of downtime that was allowed.",
      "Once United arrived at their training base in Chicago in July, access was limited. The candour of Amorim’s media conferences was not matched by his openness with training.",

      "Genuinely intrigued about how it is ‘peculiar’ to train footballers who play in the same position to move into the right areas of the pitch. Did Stone think that footballers just played five-a-side all day?",

      "The demise of Ruben Amorim at Man Utd involves Jason Wilcox, Emi Martinez and an interview so damaging to one player ‘the broadcaster agreed’ to remove it.",
      "Amorim was finally sacked after 14 months, 63 games, hundreds of millions of pounds spent and, ultimately, a tense chat with Man Utd shot-caller Wilcox, who might well have aimed a Jose Mourinho-shaped dig.",
      "With help from a great many journalists with contacts in and around Old Trafford, here are the best bits of the inside stories of Amorim’s Man Utd sacking.",
      "",
      "The meeting between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox seems destined to go down in Man Utd infamy.",
      "Amorim is described by the various reports on his demise to have been ‘overly emotional’, ‘very negative’, ‘erratic’ and even ‘incensed’ at having his tactical approach questioned in the aftermath of the Wolves home draw, which appears to have been far more damaging than the stalemate at Leeds five days later.",
      "The changes in shape which delivered a thrilling attacking performance against Bournemouth and clear improvements in the win over Newcastle were cast aside when perhaps the worst team in Premier League history came to Old Trafford, and Amorim greeted Wolves with his patented three-at-the-back formation.",
      "The result was an insipid performance and humiliating draw which underlined the disconnect between club and coach. Rob Dawson of ESPN writes that it underlined ‘a growing feeling within the club that Amorim and his staff had come to fear the Premier League’.",
      "It led to confusion in the Man Utd hierarchy, which felt that Amorim needed to show more flexibility and a willingness to adapt.",
      "Having already grown frustrated with ‘the unwanted influence of Wilcox,’ according to Simon Stone of the BBC, Amorim ‘blew up’, to phrase a couple of reports, at the perceived criticism.",
      "Two accounts of the meeting do seem especially ghost-written by a Jason W. No, that’s too obvious. Let’s say J. Wilcox.",
      "Dawson says the director of football had simply ‘encouraged’ Amorim ‘to be more proactive’ and ‘delivered the message in a calm and measured way’.",
      "Richard Jolly of the Independent writes that Wilcox was ‘not just expressing his own thoughts but those of others in the structure,’ and that ‘what Amorim probably did not realise, however, was that Wilcox was the last defending him, the last arguing he should be granted more time’ and ‘could not have done more for him’.",
      "The final call to sack Amorim was made by Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada with the full support of the rest of the Manchester United decision-making structure. The line is that the coach’s failure to carry out his promise to develop and evolve the team away from his own preferred philosophy after over a year in charge was ultimately his undoing, rather than any breakdown in relationships with higher-ups.",
      "MORE ON THE INFLUENCE OF JASON WILCOX AT MANCHESTER UNITED\n* Ta-ra, Amorim. Now for Man Utd’s inept board to hire their next underling\n* Jason Wilcox is absurdly one of English football’s most powerful figures, in accordance with the prophecy",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "Amorim, who had to be talked out of resigning during his first months in the role, is alleged to have flirted with a similar decision during the talk with Wilcox.",
      "In a wide-ranging Athletic article, Laurie Whitwell, Adam Crafton and Mark Critchley write that when Wilcox told Amorim the players ‘had become confused over his vision’, the coach simply ‘responded that the players needed to be changed’.",
      "Wilcox’s reply was diplomatic, hoping to ‘work through the issues’, but Amorim ‘reacted by saying he wished to leave the club and would be calling his agent’.",
      "He had his wish a few days later.",
      "The Telegraph says ‘those inside the club’ believed Amorim ‘wanted to go and was determined to engineer an exit,’ with one source quoted as saying: “This is a manager who basically decided to blow it all up. He’s been looking for the opportunity. He wanted out.”",
      "Richard Keys absolutely nailed it.",
      "Wilcox told the players in a meeting held after Amorim’s sacking that “we don’t understand where the last 48 hours have come from,” and how he had also “sensed some situations where they were not on the same wavelength as Amorim”.",
      "It is not known what Harry Maguire decided to emphatically head clear in response.",
      "",
      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles, the criticism, everything, we need to change the club,” Amorim said in his final public comments as Man Utd head coach.",
      "It seemed like a strange comment at the time, out of place in an already notably abrasive missive. Yet as with much of what Amorim said, it was heavily influenced by his feelings behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim had grown to feel ‘the pressure to change his system’ from Wilcox and those above him was building because of ‘continued criticism from former players in the media, including Gary Neville and Paul Scholes,’ according to ESPN’s Dawson.",
      "The three Athletic writers suggest Amorim’s comment might have been ‘a reference to the possibility that Ratcliffe watches Neville’s podcast, in which he has questioned Amorim’s tactics’.",
      "But Jamie Jackson of The Guardian says nothing will change, even with Amorim’s frustration at the set-up: ‘Whoever does take over will have to work within the structure that gives Wilcox and Berrada a higher status regarding football policy than the head coach.’",
      "Neville has, of course, since had his say.",
      "",
      "No-one should be willing to lose their job over Emiliano Martinez but there might never have been a man more willing to die on unnecessarily awkward hills than Amorim.",
      "While far from the biggest issue causing his ultimate downfall, transfers certainly contributed. Some situations are specifically cited, such as Amorim’s treatment of the bomb squad and how Alejandro Garnacho’s value was deemed to have been reduced by £15m as a direct result of how he was ostracised around the time of the Europa League final.",
      "Another bone of contention was how Amorim had a £72m striker in Benjamin Sesko foist upon him despite his desire for a proven Premier League commodity in Ollie Watkins.",
      "But the decision to sign Senne Lammens over Martinez was the bigger sticking point.",
      "That was where the Man Utd hierarchy ‘drew a line’ and ‘refused to sanction’ the transfer (Stone, BBC), which would have cost far more in a fee and wages for a much older player.",
      "But it was that experience and personality in particular which Amorim felt his squad lacked.",
      "It is said by ESPN’s Dawson that Amorim’s praise of Matheus Cunha in October – “we need leaders, but sometimes what I am thinking is we need some crazy guys” – was actually ‘viewed internally as a dig at the board for passing on Martinez’.",
      "Things came to a head in January when Amorim pushed for Antoine Semenyo, a summer target with a £65m release clause which is active through the start of the winter window.",
      "While the Bournemouth forward was disappointed with elements of Manchester United’s approach in the summer, when they eventually favoured a move for Bryan Mbeumo instead, Semenyo was willing to talk with Amorim again and did so over the phone.",
      "It was then when Semenyo sought assurances over his role but also the future composition of the team itself, having been ‘concerned’ he would be used at wing-back.",
      "Paul Hirst of The Times details how Amorim told Semenyo ‘he was a flexible manager’ during that call, and that he would be moving away from any variation of his favoured 3-4-3 formation soon.",
      "James Ducker and Sam Wallace of the Daily Telegraph corroborate that, saying Amorim told Semenyo he would be used ‘as a left-winger in a dynamic 4-3-3’. Yet days later Man Utd had reverted to type in that Wolves game, perhaps signalling to Amorim’s employers that his show of tactical flexibility and evolution was neither lasting nor worth investing more money in.",
      "",
      "As one Telegraph source said: “You can write down 100 things he said in press conferences where you’re thinking, ‘F**king hell Ruben, what are you doing? Why are you saying that?”",
      "Amorim himself appears to have accepted how many of his painfully honest public comments worked against him in the end, including his decision to question the development of three academy graduates the club had loaned out, later questioning “the feeling of entitlement” he felt had become a problem “for the kids” at the club.",
      "Those quotes and his personal barbs even at senior players, like Benjamin Sesko or the “anxiety”-ridden Patrick Dorgu, went down abysmally, much like his handling of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "In Amorim’s defence, Dawson says the Portuguese continued with his approach ‘in the hope it would elicit a positive response’ from a group he deemed “broken”, “fragile” and in need of some home truths.",
      "But there were moments he clearly crossed the line, Roy Keane MUTV rant-style, as Dawson documents:",
      "‘In another television interview last season, Amorim was so outspoken about a player that the club felt it was better to ask the broadcaster to remove the comments before they were aired. The broadcaster agreed.’",
      "It all spawned one of the great manager nicknames, delivered by ‘one player representative’ according to Hirst of The Times after Amorim declared them “the worst team in the history of Manchester United”.",
      "Farewell, “Ruben Interim”. You will be missed.",
      "Arne Slot is not on the floor, but he’s apparently reached his ceiling at Liverpool because this football is atrocious.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Dan Ashworth might have celebrated after Ruben Amorim was sacked by Man Utd, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox are in trouble.",
      "According to reports, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has indicated his ‘decision’ to INEOS as he is desperate to return to Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "Man Utd co-owners INEOS are looking to appoint a new sporting director after making the decision to sack Ruben Amorim on Monday, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has been criticised by Craig Burley over his comments about Ruben Amorim’s potential successor."

      "Arsenal ‘lead the race’ for Borussia Dortmund winger Karim Adeyemi despite rival interest from Manchester United, according to a report.",
      "Adeyemi has long been touted for a Premier League move, having made a name for himself as one of the best attackers in the German Bundesliga. The 23-year-old is versatile and can shine as a winger, second striker or centre-forward, which has seen elite Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Man Utd, Liverpool and Chelsea converge on him.",
      "As per the latest from CaughtOffside, Arsenal and Man Utd are the two sides currently battling to bring Adeyemi to England.",
      "Arsenal and Man Utd are ‘on alert’ after being informed that Dortmund have ‘placed Adeyemi on the transfer market’.",
      "BVB are ‘prepared to sanction his sale’ for €60-70million (£52-61m) this month, the report claims.",
      "Arsenal and Man Utd both hold ‘strong interest’, while Barcelona are supposedly ‘monitoring developments from a distance’. It is Arsenal who are ‘best placed’ to snare Adeyemi as the player’s camp are ‘attracted by Mikel Arteta’s project’, which could finally yield a league title this season.",
      "READ: Big Midweek: Arsenal v Liverpool, Nuno sack, Man Utd, Cole Palmer, Saudi Madrid derby",
      "Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has also laid the most groundwork for a possible deal. He has ‘outlined a defined role for Adeyemi‘, with the Germany international eyed as competition for Gabriel Martinelli on the left flank. Adeyemi could also fill in at No 9 or on the right if required.",
      "United, meanwhile, ‘face a tougher sell’ as their project is a lot further behind. Adeyemi has not been impressed by the ‘recent instability’ at Old Trafford, especially after Ruben Amorim’s fiery departure on Monday.",
      "As such, United ‘would need to offer a higher wage package’ to convince Adeyemi to join.",
      "While Adeyemi is a lightning-fast player who possesses great finishing, this would not be a risk-free deal for either Arsenal or United.",
      "His performances have dipped this term, and there has also been ‘friction behind the scenes’. This is why Dortmund have brought forward plans to sell Adeyemi.",

      "On Monday, news channels across the globe led with the ongoing story of FIFA Peace Prize winner Donald Trump’s operation to kidnap the leader of a sovereign country and put him on trial. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim was being sacked as Manchester United manager.",
      "Even almost 13 years since their last league title, United remain the biggest club in the country, up there with the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid in terms of global attention. Add up the column inches, TV segments and YouTube videos this past decade and the club demanding more attention than anyone else is Manchester United.",
      "They are the sun in which a lot of English football orbits, which is why it can be so hard to get a decision right.",
      "This is not a defence of the Glazers or Ratcliffe for hiring a manager head coach wedded to a back three and then being shocked he does not deviate from it; that is a stupid decision regardless of which club you are running. But any time so much as a tap at an Old Trafford toilet gets changed, a familiar pattern occurs.",
      "And just recently, former midfielders Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt launched their own podcast alongside United-supporting TV host Paddy McGuinness.",
      "And that podcast is where Butt made one of the more ludicrous suggestions as to who should be in the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "“Darren [Fletcher] with either Michael [Carrick] and [Steve] Bruce, and if Michael wouldn’t do it, then Darren and Bruce until the end of the season.",
      "“Bruce has got unbelievable experience. Unbelievable. He is a great bloke, really. He knows the club.",
      "“He’s got no aspirations of going back into football for [himself] so he’s not gonna go, ‘I’m in charge here, it’s my club’… He’s gonna help.”",
      "Surely that last sentence alone is enough for Bruce to be ruled out? But if we put that to one side and say the 65-year-old can be tempted with the job he always wanted, what on earth qualifies him for it?",
      "Bruce’s last gig was with League One Blackpool, where he picked up 1.39 points per game, a tally only slightly better than his last Premier League job at Newcastle, where he registered 1.15 points per game. Perhaps the only thing that qualifies him for the job is he knows how to get United winning – he has managed against them 27 times and lost 21 times.",
      "MORE ON THE AMORIM DEPARTURE ON F365",
      "* Neville names Tuchel as one of three potential Man Utd managers he ‘likes’\n* Amorim issued ‘sack’ ultimatum to INEOS as Man Utd to make January signing on one condition\n* ‘Only way’ Man Utd appoint Thomas Tuchel as Amorim replacement revealed",
      "That Newcastle stint ended in 2021 and as scary as it may all be for us to accept the movement of time, that was five years ago.",
      "Butt’s claim is that Bruce ‘knows the club’, but which club does he know? Bruce played for United from 1987 to 1996. Only five of United’s players were even born then.",
      "Butt is not alone in his suggestion. Ferdinand wanted, nay expected, himself to be Fletcher’s second call behind 13-time Premier League winner Ferguson. Keane has been suggested as someone who can get the good ship United sailing in the right direction once again.",
      "The mad ideas are not unique to United but the sheer number of them is. Enzo Maresca, a manager who achieved more than Amorim and whose club is above United, also left his job and yet someone like Hernan Crespo was not telling the Chelsea board to get Michael Ballack in because he ‘knows the club’. The closest example was the inevitable linking of Frank Lampard to the job, but that suggestion at least comes with the caveat that he is currently managing the side at the top of the Championship.",
      "With United, there is a burning desire to return to the glory years of the club. Perhaps it is the cold turkey approach of going from consistent title challengers to struggling to make the top four that has left such a yearning. The pundits we see on our screens, hear on podcasts and read in articles are from the ‘90s and ‘00s because frankly, who is there from more recently?",
      "When a TV company is deciding which pundit has more credibility and will attract more viewers, title winners are going to have more sway than a player who was at United when they finished sixth in 2019. It’s also why Paul Merson, Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Thierry Henry are the only Arsenal pundits you ever seem to see.",
      "The problem is that it creates an unrealistic standard that will never be reached and an environment where every decision is analysed under the microscope. Go and look at pictures of Amorim when he first arrived compared to when he left and it’s a similar vibe to Barack Obama’s first day as President compared to his last.",
      "The Portuguese boss was astonished in his very first week just how many interviews he had to do but that is because everyone wants a slice of the Manchester United pie. It is a club always in the news even as the 15th-best team in the league last year.",
      "The comparison of Ferguson and his long wait for a trophy is not a new one but is worth keeping in mind. Could the Scotsman have survived if every day there was a former player questioning his position? When Ferguson dropped David Beckham, could he have dealt with the resulting backlash in a social media world? Back then, Ferguson simply had to avoid reading the newspapers and go about his day.",
      "Football has changed so much in the 13 years since Ferguson walked away and harking back to that United is pining after something that is just not possible anymore.",
      "Ratcliffe and INEOS have made some questionable and at times just morally wrong decisions since taking over football operations but when every decision they make feels like the biggest decision in the world, no wonder they make some errors.",
      "Fletcher, Xavi, Zidane, whoever’s next, it won’t change. Manchester United sells more than any other club in the world and while that remains the case, expect to continue to see anyone who ever even looked at a red shirt tell the club who they should be appointing and why that will finally bring them back to the good old days.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a clean sheet against Sunderland earned with one especially fine save from Omar Alderete’s header. A less impressive clean sheet came against Burnley.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest and Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Spurs and Vicario have at least tightened up since then.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 13 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and basically had nothing to do v Palace.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a penalty save at Wolves – even if he conceded it – sees the Irishman climb towards respectability.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save v Fulham.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in. Though he’s hardly convincing…",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save v Liverpool.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Since then, performing roughly as expected, even if many remain unconvinced.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save.",

      "Man Utd legend Nicky Butt insists he would “give his season tickets back” if the Red Devils hired former Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca.",
      "The Red Devils announced on Monday that they had sacked Amorim after their 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "There were a number of reasons for his dismissal with journalist Ben Jacobs revealing that there was ‘tension over a lack of alignment in the market and a breakdown between Amorim and Jason Wilcox.’",
      "Man Utd believed that ‘there haven’t been enough signs of evolution or progress’ and Jacobs added that the club insisted no head coach will ‘be given a recruitment veto like Erik ten Hag, as Manchester United’s model is collaborative’.",
      "There have already been a number of managers linked with the vacant Man Utd job with Darren Fletcher taking over for one or two games while the Red Devils attempt to appoint an interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "Man Utd would then appoint a permanent manager in the summer with former Chelsea boss Maresca, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, Germany’s Julian Nagelsmann and Ipswich Town’s Kieran McKenna all linked.",
      "READ: Big Midweek: Arsenal v Liverpool, Nuno sack, Man Utd, Cole Palmer, Saudi Madrid derby",
      "However, Butt has urged Man Utd not to appoint Maresca, who was sacked by Chelsea last month, as he would be another ex-Man City person joining the club.",
      "Butt said: “If Maresca comes in – I like him as a coach, I really do – with the background, I would give my season tickets back.”",
      "But Man Utd legend Scholes replied: “I think going to Chelsea he would last two minutes. He has done alright.”",
      "Explaining himself, Butt added: “You mis-read me. I can’t sit here and go on about Man united philosophy and DNA and then go, ‘Well I’d love Maresca, an ex-Man City guy.’ Then you have Omar Berrarda and Jason Wilcox.",
      "“I don’t care how much success is. You’re forgetting where I’m from. Everyone is a City fan. I’m a Man United fan and I can’t accept that.”",
      "Gary Neville also talked about the DNA of the club when reacting to Amorim’s departure and the Man Utd legend has told the Red Devils that the “experiments have got to stop”.",
      "“It’s a difficult system, wing backs is challenging. The positions behind the centre forward are difficult positions. There are quite specialists positions in the system.",
      "“But that’s a failing upon the manager, the players and the club, in terms of not recruiting properly for it.",
      "“The experiments have got to stop. There is a very good video online that Bobby Charlton talks about what Man United is as a football club. Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd. Man United must take risks and play attacking football.",
      "“Man United have got to appoint a manager that fits the DNA of their club. Ajax would never change for anybody, Barcelona would never change for anybody.”",

      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",

      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",

      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",

      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 18:20, UK",
      "Manchester United have begun talking to external candidates as they look for an interim manager to take charge until the end of the season, with three former Old Trafford favourites in the mix for a possible return after Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "While the current focus is on finding an interim boss, the club haven't ruled out the possibility of making a substantive appointment, if they decide the right coach is available. For that, United are considering a much wider pool.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox is leading the process for United and following the initial, informal conversations with candidates, he is expected to conduct more formal interviews before making a recommendation in the coming days. Any final decision will be sanctioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "No timescales have been set, but it's thought the club's bosses would like to have someone in place before the Manchester derby on January 17. Fletcher is expected to be in charge for the next two matches, against Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday and Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday.",
      "Fletcher himself is a contender for the interim role, but United's hierarchy have viewed him as a promising option for the future, because of his lack of first-team coaching experience right now. Nevertheless, we've been told Fletcher has always been close with United's players, and the squad has been impressed by the early work he has done with them so far, with morale around the camp pretty high.",
      "Wilcox has already had conversations with former Old Trafford favourites Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solksjaer about the interim head coach position, with both seen as good possibilities to come into a club they know well. Both are currently out of work and available without the need to pay compensation.",

      "Asked if there was anything which could tempt him away from St James' Park, Howe replied: \"No, not at this current time.",
      "\"The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships I have with the people around me. Now that's not always been consistently good and things can change at any football club.",
      "\"But, at the moment, I am very happy.\"",
      "Current interim boss Fletcher gave his first news conference on Tuesday ahead of the midweek trip to Burnley.",
      "After a busy 24 hours, the Manchester United U18s coach said: \"It's been surreal. It's an amazing honour to lead a Manchester United team. It wasn't in my wildest dreams that it was something that could potentially happen.",
      "\"To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I'm proud to do. It's not in the circumstances I expected it to happen so that doesn't sit easy with me.",
      "\"I've got a job to do which is to lead the team tomorrow. I have great honour and pride in doing that.\"",

      "Man Utd must appoint a manager who fits with their footballing DNA, according to Gary Neville, but would fit the bill? Between the Lines breaks down the side's stylistic profile under Sir Alex Ferguson and ranks the managers whose approaches are most similar",
      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 22:52, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Fulham boss Marco Silva also make our top 10.",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 11th, his suitability score of 73.06 putting him just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Recently-axed Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who has also been linked, sits 20th in our list, with a suitability score of 67.52 out of 100.",
      "Pep Guardiola was a reported target for Manchester United before his appointment at Manchester City back in 2016 but interestingly, he sits bottom of our 32-man list, with a stylistic suitability score of just 50.77 out of 100.",
      "Some of the mooted candidates to take over from Amorim sit low in the list too, including Gareth Southgate, Kieran McKenna, Roberto De Zerbi and the Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, suggesting they are not great fits for the club's DNA.",
      "Explore our interactive graphic to see how our selected managers' styles compare to Manchester United's DNA under Ferguson.",

      "Manchester United sack Ruben Amorim in wake of rising tension at Old Trafford; Amorim dismissed after meeting with Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox; Darren Fletcher to take charge of United for Wednesday's game at Burnley; Amorim departs after 14 months in charge",
      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 19:53, UK",
      "Manchester United have sacked head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim was subsequently dismissed following a Monday morning meeting with Wilcox and Omar Berrada, United's chief executive.",
      "United are understood to have concluded that Amorim's position had become untenable.",
      "Neville said that he was \"stunned\" that during the course of Amorim's reign, Man Utd continued to play so poorly in his back-three system. \"That's a failing upon the manager, the players and the club, in terms of not recruiting properly for it.\"",
      "He has called on Man Utd to now seek out a replacement who can play in the traditional style of the club.",
      "\"The experiments have got to stop. Man Utd have got to appoint a manager that fits the DNA of their club. Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",

      "Amorim sacked - more reading and in-depth analysis:",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, is understood to feel he was not getting the backing of the club hierarchy and is frustrated by what has happened.",
      "The repeated use of the word \"manager\" in his final news conference was significant.",
      "Amorim accepts that the results were not good enough and acknowledges that he had the worst win rate of any manager at United since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "But he also felt confident that he could achieve Champions League football this season if he remained in charge and that their form would improve with the return of players from Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "Amorim felt United needed one or two experienced signings this January transfer window, in particular an experienced Premier League striker.",
      "Whilst differences of opinion over transfer policy wasn't the ultimate deciding factor in his departure, it did play a part in the breakdown of relationships with his bosses.",
      "Amorim felt that if he were given more resources now, that would guarantee Champions League football and even bigger financial returns. United's hierarchy have always been adamant they would not take that risk and will shun any return to short-term transfer decisions.",
      "Amorim has told friends he struggled to cope with the noise from outside the club, which he feels undermined the job he was doing.",
      "Whilst he is adamant that the job wasn't too big for him, he was surprised by how political and difficult the role is at Manchester United, and feels it is an impossible job to prepare fully for, because no one understands the unique challenges until they are in place at Old Trafford.",
      "The Portuguese coach feels he had less and less input into footballing decisions as time went on. Whilst he feels he always tried to be true to himself, he accepts that his often emotional response in front of the media was to his detriment.",
      "Amorim departs after 14 months in charge, with his final game the 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's dismissal was announced by Man Utd shortly after 10am on Monday.",
      "In a statement, United confirmed \"the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"",

      "Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024 on a two-and-a-half-year contract, which was due to expire in June 2027.",
      "But in an apparent pointed message to the Old Trafford hierarchy following Sunday's draw at Leeds, he said he saw himself as manager.",
      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.\"",
      "That outburst followed cryptic suggestions to the media just before Christmas that he had not received the backing he anticipated in the transfer market.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen.\"",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 06:03, UK",
      "Liam Rosenior will watch his new team in action for the first time since being named Chelsea manager when they make the short trip to Craven Cottage to face his former club Fulham on Wednesday night. A watching brief, but there is little time to bed in.",
      "Chelsea have seven more matches to play in January even after this one, in four different competitions, with London derbies in both the domestic cups and a Champions League trip to Napoli thrown in. All while navigating the Premier League.",
      "It is called being thrown in at the deep end after stints at Hull and Strasbourg so perhaps taking the chance to watch this one from the stands is understandable, particularly after Chelsea picked up a memorable point away to Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "That last-gasp equaliser gives them a bit of momentum but Enzo Fernandez's scrappy finish was nothing compared to what Harris Reed treated the Cottage to earlier that afternoon. His even later leveller against Liverpool was a goal-of-the-season contender.",
      "Such drama is never too far away between these teams. In August, of course, Josh King had a goal controversially ruled out following an erroneous VAR check. How Fulham would love a measure of revenge by ruining Rosenior's return to take over their rivals.Adam Bate",
      "Ten games unbeaten. That is the run that Manchester City are on right now in all competitions; it is just that it does not feel quite so positive after their eight-game winning streak has ended with back-to-back draws, allowing Arsenal to pull clear again.",
      "The draw at the Stadium of Light, where Sunderland remain unbeaten this season, was one thing. Dropping two points in stoppage time at home to Chelsea was another. Pep Guardiola's side paid for their profligacy. It was sloppy. Not the mark of champions.",
      "But with Arsenal still to come to the Etihad Stadium in the spring, the onus is on City to regroup quickly and reduce the gap to three points ahead of the Gunners' game against Liverpool on Thursday. Beating Brighton at home - and preferably well - is now a must.",
      "While it felt like just a rare off night for Erling Haaland, it was perhaps a little concerning that the congested fixture list might be catching up with Rayan Cherki after his brilliant run of form. Maybe this is an opportunity for Guardiola to freshen things up in attack.",
      "Take liberties and Brighton can take advantage. After the ignominy of failing to beat West Ham twice in a month, they did win against Burnley last time out. Fabian Hurzeler's side came from behind to beat City in August. Do the double and it could be title race over.Adam Bate",
      "There is always a fascination with how teams perform after the exit of a divisive manager - sorry, Ruben, head coach - so there will be plenty of eyes on Turf Moor in one of the two later kick-offs on Wednesday evening where Manchester United return to action.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been appointed as United's interim boss, perhaps even interim to the interim boss. Will he take a minimalist approach to the role or overhaul the formation? Will he pick his son? Will he pick both sons? And will any of it actually work?",
      "In truth, Fletcher's options are limited given the list of absentees at United. He cannot even make the statement move of recalling Kobbie Mainoo with him out injured. But any kind of response to Amorim's departure - positive or negative - will bring intrigue.",
      "For Burnley, a club that now appears to be enduring rather than enjoying their Premier League return, this has to be regarded as an opportunity. Scott Parker did not like what he saw at Brighton last time out but United under the lights is a very different occasion.",
      "A record of two points from 11 games is the worst in the Premier League over that period. Burnley are still just about within touching distance of the teams above them but the turnaround will have to come quickly to save them. This would be a good time.Adam Bate",
      "Everton's mixed form at their new stadium continues after conceding four at home for the second time in four matches as they were beaten 4-2 by Brentford at the weekend. A repeat of anything like that against bottom club Wolves would spark serious scrutiny.",
      "David Moyes' side have actually picked up as many points away from the Hill Dickinson Stadium this season as they have inside it, their recent win at Nottingham Forest being their fourth of the season on the road. Doing it without Iliman Ndiaye was impressive.",
      "But if Everton are to bounce back then they will need others to step up, so amid the wreckage of that Brentford defeat it was encouraging that both misfiring strikers scored, while Jack Grealish bagged his first assists since August - against Wolves.",
      "That 3-2 win at Molineux feels an age ago now for the visitors, who are surely doomed for the drop. But Wolves boss Rob Edwards is entitled to feel a corner has been turned after a deserved point at Manchester United and that long-awaited win over West Ham.",
      "With teenage sensation Mateus Mane reenergising the Wolves supporters, it is Wolves who - improbably - come into this match with more momentum and certainly under less pressure. Back-to-back wins really would put Moyes' team under the spotlight.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace are navigating a difficult period at the moment, with Oliver Glasner currently on the worst run since he was appointed to the role in February 2024 after going seven games without a win.",
      "The Eagles have plummeted from fourth place in the Premier League on December 10, to 14th as things stand following the 2-0 defeat to Newcastle last time out.",
      "Facing a high-flying Aston Villa, who are level on points with Manchester City in second, should fill them with dread but Palace can take comfort and confidence from their recent encounters with Unai Emery's side.",
      "Unbeaten in their last six meetings with Villa across all competitions, Palace have been a constant thorn in the side of Emery and addressing their current rut with a win at Selhurst Park on Wednesday could add to this trend.",
      "On paper, it should be a routine win for Villa against a team low on confidence and form. But football isn't played on paper.",
      "The Eagles are due a win and Villa should be wary of a familiar foe getting the better of them again.Patrick Rowe",
      "After a promising start to life at Tottenham, one that had Spurs up in third after taking 17 points from the first nine games, Thomas Frank appears to have lost his way this season. Perhaps he will share some wine - and that sentiment - with Andoni Iraola.",
      "At least Iraola has credit in the bank and slightly lower expectations to deal with. Frank is facing more immediate discontent at Spurs, not least because of the style of play. The hope was that they were getting a details man, someone who would improve set pieces.",
      "Not only has the rest of the Premier League caught up with Frank in that regard this season, but his Tottenham team are not doing nearly enough in open play. In fact, they have not even scored a goal from open play in their last six games in all competitions.",
      "Newcastle will aim to win a third consecutive Premier League game for the first time this season when they host Leeds. Bruno Guimaraes is leading their resurgence.",
      "It is nothing new to see the 28-year-old inspiring the side, of course. But he has notably increased his attacking contribution this season. His goals in the wins over Crystal Palace and Burnley took him to seven in 19 Premier League games so far.",
      "He is their joint top scorer, alongside Nick Woltemade. With half of the campaign still to come, he has already matched his highest goal total in a full season for Newcastle.",
      "Guimaraes continues to play an invaluable role out of possession in Eddie Howe's midfield. But his increased attacking threat can be seen in his numbers for shots as well as goals. Guimaraes's averages this season have hit new highs.",
      "Newcastle's attack has been boosted by the return to fitness of Yoane Wissa, whose competition with Woltemade for the No 9 spot can only help. But if they find themselves in need of a goal against Leeds, their captain is the most likely candidate to step up.Nick Wright",
      "Igor Thiago's hat-trick against Everton on Sunday took him to 14 Premier League goals this season. He is the only player who even gets close to Erling Haaland in the scoring charts. Sunderland will be out to stop him at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "The Black Cats know how ruthless he can be. Thiago scored with his only effort on goal at the Stadium of Light in August, when Sunderland had to come from behind to win 2-1. But they can approach the task with confidence after a string of fine defensive displays.",
      "Sunderland have only conceded twice in their last five games. They were breached from a set piece at Spurs on Sunday but before that game they shackled Haaland impressively, inspired by centre-back duo Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete.",
      "Mukiele and Alderete rank as two of the signings of the season and there are candidates elsewhere in the Sunderland team too. Granit Xhaka has had a transformative impact in midfield. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs has arguably been even better, conceding five goals fewer than he should have, based on the quality of chances faced.",
      "Sunderland will need all four of those players to continue in the same vein against Brentford and the in-form Thiago. But, similarly to the Bees, with whom they are now vying for a European place, they have been quick to show they belong at this level.Nick Wright",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 06:03, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek card.",
      "Cristian Romero likes to defend in a manner that can quickly tip over from assertive to reckless. It's why referees know his name. Eight yellow cards and a red already this season tells its own story.",
      "Bournemouth are very good at inviting chaos that leads to cards. Andoni Iraola's side want to play quickly, get the ball into feet between the lines and force centre-backs to make decisions they don't want to make. That's where Evanilson comes in - a striker who is a genuine card magnet.",
      "Since the start of last season he's drawn 21 cards from opponents - only Bruno Guimarães has drawn more.",
      "Romero is 2/1 with Sky Bet to be carded. It's a bet.",
      "Robin Roefs has been nothing short of sensational since his £11.5m move from NEC Nijmegen in August. Seven clean sheets bagged already this season, including three in the last five games, tells the story. His save ratio of 78.4 per cent is the best in the league.",
      "Roefs leads all goalkeepers for xG prevented at +4.9, meaning he's conceded almost five goals fewer than expected and only Martin Dubravka has made more saves this season (70). Away from home across his last nine games, he's averaging 4.3 saves per 90 where those backing his 4+ saves line have landed the money in seven of those games.",
      "Brentford arrive in great nick, having taken 10 points and scored 10 goals in their last four games, and are turning games into ones where the opposition goalkeeper is constantly called into action. Roefs to make four or more saves at 10/11 with Sky Bet rates as a value play.",
      "This fixture is all about the dugout dynamic.",
      "Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner seem to know exactly how to play Aston Villa and Unai Emery. The record is startling. Palace are unbeaten in the last six meetings, winning five of them, with an aggregate score of 19-4. Pure domination.",
      "And when patterns like that persist across different game states, venues and moments in the season, it's fair to declare that Glasner has Emery's number. It's a system Villa have repeatedly struggled to solve. Every time they try to step on Palace, they get pulled into transitional chaos, exactly where Glasner's side thrive.",
      "At Selhurst Park, with Palace's recent dominance in this fixture and a manager who repeatedly outmanoeuvres his opposite number, the fact Palace are the outsiders at 2/1 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy angle to attack.",
      "Defensively, Wolves look transformed.",
      "Across their last five Premier League matches, Wolves have posted an expected goals against figure of just 1.01 per 90 - it's the second-best defensive record in the league over that sample size. And context elevates it further. This run includes games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool - fixtures that usually inflate defensive numbers rather than squeeze them. West Ham found that out on Saturday.",
      "They were restricted to scraps in terms of attacking return while for the first time this season the Wolves attack found a ruthless streak in the 3-0 win. Similar results may follow in recent weeks.",
      "Everton could struggle to find a way through making the double chance option on the away win a bet to play at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Whether it's Joao Pedro dropping in and rolling defenders or Liam Delap playing on the shoulder and inviting contact, Chelsea's forwards are excellent at turning physical battles into card parties. Fouls get drawn. And cards tend to follow.",
      "Eight centre-backs have been carded against Chelsea in their last 15 games, so Fulham defender Jorge Cuenca could be walking into a proper examination here.",
      "Cuenca's recent record suggests he's not immune to catching the referee's eye. He's been booked in two of his last four games and historically he carries a fairly punchy card profile. A 0.28 cards-per-90 ratio from his time in La Liga tells you he's a defender who plays on the front foot, happy to engage early rather than drop off. The 7/2 with Sky Bet for a Cuenca card has a chance.",
      "Brighton are not your average mid-table Premier League team when visiting the elite, and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shot bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 12 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under Fabian Hurzerler's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 14.5 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.5 expected goals per game. That is an outrageous output and one which deserves full respect in this fixture where City could be without their first-choice defensive duo in Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.",
      "The markets are behind on this shots curve. We can jump on Brighton to register 10 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet - something they have landed in their last three head-to-heads with Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore.",
      "Newcastle have scored at least twice in each of their last 11 home matches. That attacking consistency was on show again last time out when they delivered exactly what was expected by this column against Crystal Palace, where the 10/11 for a home win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals landed. No need to change a winning formula then.",
      "Expect goals, expect control and expect Newcastle to deliver in front of their own fans yet again. The 4/5 on offer through the Sky Bet BuildABet function for Newcastle to win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals remains a bet to follow.",
      "According to the Premier League title-winning odds, it's never been more likely this season than now that Arsenal will land the outright prize. After Chelsea's late salvo at Manchester City, the 1/4 on offer with Sky Bet on Arsenal for the title is the shortest price they've been all season. Only Arsenal can stop Arsenal now.",
      "For this game the under 2.5 goals line is worth a look at 11/10 with Sky Bet. Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot are cut from a similar cloth. Territory matters. Risk management matters. Neither wants a basketball match",
      "When two managers are this obsessed with control, the game often eats itself. In big games between elite managers of this nature, it often promises drama and delivers tension instead. One goal either way could be enough.",
