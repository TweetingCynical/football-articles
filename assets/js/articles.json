      "Alejandro Garnacho's partner has dropped a strong hint that the winger will indeed leave Manchester United this summer - after being told he has no future at the club by Ruben Amorim.",
      "United play their final game of the season against Aston Villa on Sunday and Eva Garcia's post on Instagram will heighten speculation that Garnacho will be departing in the summer transfer window. The 20-year-old was upset to be left on the bench for the Europa League final in Bilbao and that appears to have been the final straw for the United boss.",
      "Garnacho has previously been linked with Napoli and Chelsea. United are willing to sell any of their players in the upcoming transfer window after losing to Tottenham and Garnacho is one of their most sought-after assets.",
      "Posting on her Instagram story ahead of the 4pm kick-off on the final day of the Premier League season, Eva wrote: \"last match\" with a smiling and crying emoji.",
      "United come into their final match at Old Trafford sitting 16th in the Premier League and without a win in eight league games. Defeat in Bilbao means they will not play in any European competition next season and Sir Jim Ratcliffe is ready to rip apart the underperforming squad for manager Ruben Amorim this summer.",
      "Garnacho has been a key player for United this season, contributing 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games, but is now expected to leave when the window opens for business on June 1. He previously fuelled rumours he wants to leave by putting his house up for sale and his behaviour since the Spurs defeat speaks volumes.",
      "Speaking after the Spurs defeat, in which Mason Mount started ahead of him, Garnacho made his frustrations obvious. “It’s hard for everyone,\" he said.",
      "“The season was s***, both now losing the final tonight, and in the league, where we didn’t beat anyone, that’s the truth. Up until the final, I’ve played every round, and today to play 20 minutes… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens after.”",
      "While their opponents are gunning for a place in the Champions League, Amorim faces a battle to keep his players motivated for the Villa game.",
      "\"I always speak to my players, but the focus now is on the last game. I don't know what is going to happen,\" he said in his pre-match press conference.",
      "“We have a plan and we prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without. We have an idea what type of squad we want, but now we have to focus on the last game and we will have time address all of those situations.\"",

      "As if the week needed a final exclamation mark to reaffirm the mediocrity of Manchester United, it came in Naples on Friday night. Against Cagliari, a cross came over from the right flank and Scott McTominay hooked an acrobatic volley into the net for his 12th goal in a Napoli shirt.",
      "Romele Lukaku doubled the home side’s lead and the win meant Napoli were crowned Serie A champions. Lukaku is a former United player but it is McTominay’s story that provides another damning chapter to the grim chronicle of United’s remarkable slide into ineptitude.",
      "And McTominay’s brilliance in Serie A highlights the one failing that eclipses all others - and there are many of those - at Old Trafford. Quite simply, whoever has been in charge of buying and selling players has left the club in a mess.",
      "In the modern era, has one club ever registered a list of mistakes as long as Manchester United’s? Think of the whopping errors in the buying market. Think of the fees in excess of £70million apiece for Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "But the biggest error came when they decided to sell a player who had been nurtured by the club since he was five years old. What on earth possessed United to sell McTominay? Maybe the £25million they received from Napoli helped compliance with the Profit and Sustainability Rules.",
      "He was not a prolific scorer for United but by the time he left, he was a good finisher and is probably now a better finisher than anyone currently on the Old Trafford books.",
      "“How you can sell Scott is beyond me,” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said recently. The midfield axis of McTominay and Fred - McFred - was often derided but United could have done with it on Wednesday night in Bilbao.",
      "For a moment, though, let’s salute McTominay’s achievements in Italy without using them as a stick with which to beat United. He is the highest-scoring midfielder in Serie A and has been named as the league’s Most Valuable Player.",
      "Amongst Serie A midfielders, only Christian Pulisic has had more touches in the opposition box. Amongst all Serie A players, only Yerry Mina, the Cagliari centre-back, has won more duels than McTominay. Only Nico Paz, of Como, has had more attempts on goal from midfield than McTominay. He has become an idol in Naples.",
      "After a lifetime at Old Trafford, McTominay clearly fancied a change of scenery. But that was because he was under-appreciated - box to box midfielders of McTominay’s reliability do not come along very often.",
      "When he was sold in August of last year, the suggestion was that Erik ten Hag was not very happy. No wonder. There has been a whole procession of events that have symbolised Manchester United’s fall from football’s elite table.",
      "The 18 Premier League defeats, the sacking of staff, the leaking roof, the hire and dismissal of a sporting director. But none highlight the ineptitude as starkly as the wonderful success in Italy of one of their own.",

      "Amid growing rumours suggesting Emiliano Martinez will leave Aston Villa this summer, Manchester United have entered the fray as a potential destination. And the Argentina No. 1 is a big fan of at least two players he could call his team-mates next season.",
      "Speculation is rife that Martinez, who has four years remaining on the five-year contract he signed in 2024, is heading for the Villa Park exit. Reports point to major interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia, while Atletico Madrid and United are also touted as contenders for his signature.",
      "World Cup-winner Martinez, 32, was visibly emotional following Villa's last home game of the Premier League campaign, a 2-0 win over Tottenham. And he appeared to hint at a possible exit when questioned about his future after that result, saying: \"Of course, it is the last match [of the season] here, and I don’t know.\"",
      "But he could find at least two familiar faces at Old Trafford in Lisandro Martinez and Alejandro Garnacho. The stopper won the 2022 World Cup alongside Martinez, while Garnacho was part of the same Argentina squad that clinched the Copa America last year.",
      "And Martinez is seemingly a big fan of both players, describing namesake Lisandro as an \"animal\" following their famous win in Qatar almost three years ago. The defender was still in the early days of his United tenure when he won the biggest honour in the sport, but helped form part of the same back line that pipped France to the prize.",
      "It was just a few months later that Lisandro then got his hands on the League Cup, his first title in English football. And Villa ace Martinez was among the first to congratulate his compatriot as he commented on a celebratory Instagram post simply: \"Wins everywhere.\"",
      "Madrid-born Garnacho only made his debut for Argentina in June 2023, coming on as a substitute in a 2-0 friendly win over Australia. But it quickly became apparent Martinez was impressed by the winger, and not simply due to his on-ball ability.",
      "\"He is a very humble guy. He came to work; he didn't talk a lot,\" he told TyC Sports. \"He is very eager to play. The truth is that he's a little treasure and I hope we can mould him so that he gives us as much as Angel Di Maria.\"",
      "There's a chance the trio will come into contact on Sunday when United host Villa in their last game of the season. Unai Emery's side are still chasing qualification for the Champions League as they sit sixth, while a move up to 14th is the best finish United can hope for.",
      "Martinez, 27, won't play a part in the fixture after suffering a season-ending ACL injury in February, while Garnacho's status is uncertain. United boss Ruben Amorim dropped the forward for Wednesday's Europa League final defeat to Spurs, with the Daily Mail reporting Garnacho has now been told he can leave this summer.",
      "That could mean Martinez only finds one of his countrymen in common should he move to Manchester in the coming months. And Emery himself has hinted there could be departures amid a swell of interest in Villa's in-demand stars after a superb campaign.",
      "\"It is difficult for the team, it has been difficult for some players,\" he told reporters ahead of the trip to Old Trafford. \"I was struggling five months ago with not enough results we achieved in that moment. But now I am so so happy with the individual responses of the players, how the team is focused in each match – as well some players with some speculation.\"",
      "Andre Onana has struggled to inspire support among United fans since reuniting with former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag two years ago. That has led to speculation that the Red Devils could be set for another change of guard between the posts, though United may struggle to beat the competition given their lack of European football next season."

The German mastermind will go down in the annals of history as one of Liverpool's greatest-ever managers, leaving Anfield in 2024 with a Premier League and a Champions League to his name.",
      "Yet he might've been in the United dugout if not for Ulla's intervention, as Phil Thompson revealed an attempt to snatch Klopp for Old Trafford. The Liverpool legend, speaking to Norway's TV2 in 2019, said: \"I interviewed Klopp for Sky, and I asked if he and Liverpool were created for each other.",
      "\"He looked at me and asked, 'Why?' Then Klopp told me he could have taken over Manchester United, but his wife said it wasn't right. When Liverpool arrived, his wife said it was right.",

As United continue their search for post-Ferguson stability, now under the guidance of Ruben Amorim, they can only wonder what might have been if Klopp had chosen differently.",
      "After taking over from Erik ten Hag in November, Amorim has struggled to make an impact with his inherited squad in the 2024/25 season, resulting in United's lowest-ever Premier League finish after Sunday's season finale against Aston Villa. In stark contrast, Liverpool are set to celebrate their second Premier League title since the league's inception in 1992, after their own match against Crystal Palace at Anfield.",

      "The Northern Ireland international has plenty of similarities with Os boss Richie Wellens. Both midfielders were released by Manchester United as youngsters after solitary first-team appearances.",
      "Wellens went on to have a long, successful career from the old Third Division to the second tier. And Galbraith, the man Charlton must silence at Wembley this afternoon, is well on his way to doing the same.",
      "“There is no doubt in my mind that Ethan Galbraith is a Premier League player,” Wellens says. Galbraith, however, believes he is only part-way through the journey.",
      "“It’s obviously nice,” he says of Wellens’ appraisal. “But at the minute I don’t feel I’m quite there. As a footballer you strive to get as far as you can, so if I do manage to get there in the future it will be unbelievable. For now I’m just focused on the here and now.”",
      "Galbraith, who has also been used as a right back this season, says being able to absorb Wellens’ knowledge has been key.",
      "Yet he reckons he still needs to improve “everything around the game.” He continues: “Tactically, game management - as a young player at times you can drift in and out of games but working with the gaffer I’ve gotten a lot better at that. Last year I was a bit naive but working with him now I’ve picked up good habits.",
      "“He’s let me play the game. I learn a lot from him. He was in sort of the same position and the knowledge he has of the game, what he passes down, is absolutely great for me.”",
      "At the beginning of December Orient were in 21st place and appeared more likely to face a relegation battle than a promotion push. Two Championship clubs, one of them Swansea, also made bids for Galbraith in January that were swiftly rejected.",
      "But Orient went on to win 20 of the 30 remaining games before seeing off Stockport in a semi-final shoot-out, with Galbraith scoring the final kick.",
      "He says the belief inside the squad that something special could happen never wavered. “It comes from having a good group,” he adds. “We’ve all said it, even when we were going through that rough stage we had the players and belief we could turn it around. I’m not too sure many others thought we could but inside the group we knew.”"

      "Sancho, 25, was exiled at United by Ten Hag after the winger publicly called out his manager after Ten Hag questioned his efforts in training. The spat saw Sancho left out in the cold for months before heading out on loan to his former club, Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He headed out on loan again this season, joining Chelsea for the 2024-25 campaign on a loan deal with an obligation to buy. However, the Blues can back out of a permanent deal if they are willing to pay a £5million penalty, which they look likely to do.",

The Red Devils come into this match still reeling from their Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao earlier this week—a loss that not only dashed their European hopes but also cost the club a staggering £100 million. This marks only the second time since 1990 that United will miss out on European competition next season.",
      "United's Premier League campaign has been nothing short of disappointing, with 18 losses out of 37 matches and failing to secure back-to-back wins throughout the entire season—a rarity in the club's storied history. Under Ruben Amorim, they've been unable to find form, going winless in their last eight league games, including three consecutive defeats. A loss on Sunday, coupled with a Tottenham victory elsewhere, could see them finish as low as 17th.",
      "In stark contrast, Aston Villa arrives at Old Trafford with high stakes and motivation. Currently sixth in the table and level on points with Newcastle United and Chelsea, Villa's goal difference leaves them needing a win to keep Champions League dreams alive. Victory would secure their spot if either Newcastle or Chelsea falter, or if Manchester City falls to Fulham.",
      "However, if Villa only manage a draw, their fate becomes more precarious. They would then need Newcastle to lose against Everton, as no result from Nottingham Forest versus Chelsea would allow Villa to overtake both rivals.",

      "Barca emerged as Rashford's dream destination when he was in the process of leaving United in January and the newly-crowned LaLiga champions explored signing him on loan. Flick is clearly a fan of the United forward, as is Barcelona sporting director Deco, who praised both Diaz and Rashford in midweek.",
      "\"We like Luis, we like Rashford, and we like other players,\" Deco told Catalan radio station RAC 1. \"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",
      "Flick echoed Deco's comments ahead of Barca's final game of the season away to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. \"I don't want to talk about players who aren't part of my team, but they're both fantastic players and I like them,\" the former Bayern Munich and Germany boss said. \"We'll see what happens.\"",

      "Reports from Spain suggest that the German is planning to reshape his attack next term, despite his title-winning side scoring 99 goals in La Liga so far this season. Ideally, left winger Raphinha would be brought inside to play in the No.10 role behind striker Robert Lewandowski while top target Diaz and teenage sensation Lamine Yamal would operate on the flanks.",
      "Ferran Torres was Flick's go-to guy from the bench this campaign and produced an impressive 19 goals and seven assists before surgery to treat appendicitis curtailed his season earlier this month.

      "\"I went to Viana do Castelo, a town about 50km away from Braga to watch a Sporting academy game. I was looking at an old player I knew and saw Pedro, a kid that was captain of an U15 team despite only being 13.",
      "\"He was super talented, ambitious and easy to spot because he stood out. He showed courage, technique and intensity, the best player on the team.",
      "\"After watching a few more matches, we asked Pedro's parents if he'd come to Braga for trials and within two days, he was there. Pedro's parents said 'he's been at Sporting three years and they've never said anything'.",
      "\"When he was in the U17s, he really started to take off, he matured and his performances went to another level. It wasn't long before he broke into the first team, he scored just minutes into his senior debut and the rest was history.\""

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has sent a touching message to ex-team-mate Scott McTominay after he fired Napoli to the Serie A title. McTominay, 28, was sold by boyhood club United last summer for £25million.",
      "Then-manager Erik ten Hag was against the move but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the rest of the Red Devils hierarchy couldn't resist Napoli's offer. McTominay has proven his doubters wrong and was named Serie A player of the season Friday after scoring in their 2-0 victory over Cagliari which sealed the Scudetto.",
      "The midfielder's overhead kick was his 12th league goal of the season and post-match, he was given the Serie A MVP award and his 96-rated card on the game EA FC 25. Fernandes shared a photo of McTominay with the two accolades on Instagram.",
      "\"Congrats my friend,\" the United skipper wrote as the caption. \"Resilience, discipline and determination have always been there from you! Now with confidence your qualities are shining more than ever. Enjoy your moment.\"",
      "Critics claim that clubs are incentivised to sell homegrown players due to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules. By selling an academy product, the club makes 'pure profit'.",
      "The rule was something which Ten Hag alluded to when explaining McTominay's departure. \"Unfortunately, it's the rules,\" he bemoaned following the 28-year-old's exit. \"You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It's not the right thing to do but for everyone, for all parts, it's a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player but also for us.\"",
      "The Dutchman, who was sacked in October, added: \"I'm very happy for him and for us, but it's mixed [feelings] because I would have preferred not to lose him. He has Manchester United in his veins... He was so important for our team, he was at Manchester United for over 22 years.\"",
      "Amid the elation of Napoli's title win, McTominay said: \"I'm lost for words. It's incredible you know, the sacrifice that every single player in the group has put forward to the cause.",
      "\"The people deserve it because they've been behind us from day one, and for me to come and experience this is a dream.\"",
      "Fernandes' own future at United is uncertain, revealing after Wednesday's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham that he'd be willing to leave Old Trafford if they wanted to 'cash in'.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this.\""

      "Ratcliffe, who owns 28.94 per cent of the Premier League giants, was in Bilbao on Wednesday to watch United lose the Europa League final 1-0 against Tottenham. The result makes Ratcliffe's job much harder, as the Red Devils won't receive money from playing in Europe next season.",
      "That's mainly down to United having their worst ever Premier League season. A defeat to Villa, who are chasing Champions League football, could see Ruben Amorim's side drop from 16th to 17th, the place directly above the relegation zone.",
      "Ratcliffe isn't expected to be watching at Old Trafford, though, as reported by the Mail. Supporters are planning to stage a protest march to Old Trafford ahead of kick-off, something which has been seen multiple times this season.",
      "Ratcliffe has personally witnessed protests throughout the season, with fans regularly unfurling banners and chanting in front of the directors' box. The messages have been centred around supporters being shifted from their long-time seats in favour of corporate tickets next season.",
      "Greater Manchester United Police have been working alongside United and will monitor the protest. Earlier this month, a statement from supporters group The 1958 read: \"Our final home game of the season is against Aston Villa. We march, as one fanbase, to make it clear - 20 years on, the fire still burns red, with fury and defiance. We protest, once again, at Villa.",
      "\"May 2005 marked one of the darkest days in the history of Manchester United Football Club. The Glazer family became majority shareholders, triggering a compulsory takeover that was completed on 29th June 2005.",
      "\"That moment signalled the beginning of the end for the soul and community of our once-great club - sacrificed at the altar of corporate greed. Sir Alex Ferguson, a staunch supporter of the Glazers then and now, masked the damage with unprecedented success on the pitch.",
      "\"Since his retirement, the rot beneath has been laid bare for all to see - the true cost of 20 years of financial exploitation and mismanagement. The club is drowning in over a billion pounds of debt. Our fanbase is fractured and divided, our stadium neglected - down to Glazer greed and betrayal.",
      "Will Manchester United beat Aston Villa? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions have been siphoned off to service that debt - not by the Glazers, but by our club. All while the Glazers continue to pocket dividends, year after year, regardless of failure on the pitch. Old Trafford, once the Theatre of Dreams, is crumbling from decades of neglect. They've taken everything.",
      "\"Now, even Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival has come at the cost of hundreds of jobs, further punishing a fanbase already suffering under the Glazers' reign. Lifelong, loyal supporters are being driven away from the club they love - priced out and pushed aside.",
      "\"Another dagger in the heart of our footballing community. We want the Glazers out of our club. They were never welcome. They are not welcome now. They will never be welcome.\""

      "\"And football sometimes is like this. I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days.",

      "Al-Hilal are ready to pay £100million for the 30-year-old and want him for the Club World Cup, while the likes of Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have also been credited with an interest in Fernandes.",
      "And when asked about Fernandes' comments ahead of United's clash with Aston Villa on the final day of the Premier League season, Amorim didn't definitively say his star man would be staying put, instead declaring: \"I will speak with my players but my focus is the last game.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen. We have a plan — we were prepared for both situations, with or without Champions League.",

      "Manchester United will be targeting a win in their final game of a forgettable 2024/25 Premier League campaign when they welcome Aston Villa to Old Trafford this afternoon, kick-off 4pm.",
      "United were beaten 1-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in midweek. The Reds have failed to win in the Premier League since the March international break, meaning they head into the clash with Unai Emery's team without a win in eight in the league.",
      "A protest against the Glazers will be held before today's game. It is 20 years since they took charge of the club and fans have had enough.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim plans to make a post-match speech after the game and we'll bring you every word from the United boss.",
      "Follow LIVE updates and analysis from Old Trafford in the blog below.",
      "It would be great to see Chido Obi given his full debut at Old Trafford this afternoon. Obi made his first senior appearance from the bench against Tottenham in February and he's been given a handful of other opportunities since then.",
      "Ruben Amorim has nothing to lose by starting Obi considering he has been let down by Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who have scored just 17 goals between them in all competitions. Amorim has described Obi as \"naive\" on two occasions and his inexperience has been obvious, but this is a dead-rubber fixture.",
      "Following their 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge just over a week ago, United will end this Premier League campaign without winning back-to-back league games. That is criminal.",
      "They last went without back-to-back league triumphs in a single season back in 1921/22.",
      "United youngster Sekou Kone could be in contention to make his United debut today. It looks as though he will be included in the matchday squad after arriving at Old Trafford carrying his boot bag a short time ago.",
      "United matchgoers have turned on the owners and the decision-makers but not the team or the manager. They didn't air Ruben Amorim's chant once in the second half of the Europa League final but it would be extreme to see they have outright turned against him.",
      "Some players could cop some flak today, though. Many have outstayed their welcome or just not made the most of the opportunity of a lifetime to play for United. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial were cheered off last season and Rasmus Hojlund received similar treatment earlier this year.",
      "United supporter group The 1958 will stage another protest ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford this afternoon.",
      "The protest will start at 3pm on Sir Matt Busby Way at the junction with Chester Road. Supporters will form behind a large banner and march down Warwick Road.",
      "It is 20 years since the Glazers took control of United and supporters have had enough. The way in which this season has unfolded has not helped matters one bit.",
      "It's a rather generic programme cover today. An image of the Old Trafford pitch from inside the goal at the Scoreboard End. Perhaps there is a message there, for the ball has not ended up anywhere near enough between the posts for United this season.",
      "One hopes Ruben Amorim picks an intriguing team today. Anybody who shouldn't be at United next season shouldn't start. It would not be a good look for Amorim to be in a charitable mood and give Victor Lindelof a start, for example.",
      "The 1958 have organised a protest against the Glazers before this afternoon's Aston Villa game. They are set to congregate at the Old Trafford forecourt around an hour before kick-off and I'm planning on heading down from the media room to report on it.",
      "The anger in the air will be palpable today. Fan unrest is rife, United just lost against Tottenham in the Europa League final and Aston Villa could smell blood and hammer them on the final day of the season. It’s always darkest before the dawn, but the light at the end of the tunnel hasn't appeared yet and fans will express their frustrations.",
      "Ruben Amorim will make a speech after full-time and the players will complete a lap of honour. Insert your own jokes here. A lap of dishonour? A lap of shame? Amorim said it was tradition and vowed to speak honestly from the heart when he addresses disenchanted supporters.",
      "There were also chuckles among the press pack when he said there wasn't time for an explanation for the awful season during his speech. Amorim is a brilliant communicator and he'll have to be to appease an angry crowd. Most supporters would prefer the speech and 'lap of honour' to be scrapped for this season and Amorim must hit the right notes, which won't be easy.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho's comments after the Europa League final were the straw that broke the camel's back. Garnacho has worked his ticket since his promotion to the first-team from the academy.",
      "Erik ten Hag was forced to discipline him and Amorim has cracked the whip in his first season in charge, but United's head coach has seen enough and informed Garnacho to find a new club this summer.",
      "It's a genuine shame that Garnacho's time at Old Trafford looks set to end on a sour note because he is one of the biggest recent success stories from the academy. I believe Garnacho has actually had an underrated campaign, but no player is bigger than the manager and he's overstepped the line on too many occasions. There are consequences for actions.",
      "Aston Villa arrive at Old Trafford this afternoon with the ambition of wrapping up a top five spot and securing Champions League qualification for next season.",
      "Villa are currently sixth in the table, behind fifth-placed Chelsea on goal difference. A draw could be enough to elevate Villa into the top five, but that will also rely on Newcastle United losing to Everton and fellow top five hopefuls Nottingham Forest and Chelsea drawing at the City Ground.",
      "It means Villa, ideally, need to go for the win. However, due to their inferior goal difference in comparison with Chelsea and Newcastle, a win for both of those two would see Villa miss out.",
      "It could be an afternoon of monitoring scores elsewhere for the travelling Villa fans.",
      "United are on the brink of one of their biggest summer transfer windows in years, meaning several members of today's matchday squad could be offloaded by the time Old Trafford's turnstiles turn again in August.",
      "Tom Heaton, Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are all out-of-contract and Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave.",
      "Heaton's situation remains undecided, but it is understood Evans, Lindelof and Eriksen will all be allowed to leave at the end of their contracts next month.",
      "However, the expectation is that others will follow them through the exit door over the summer. United are planning for departures to reach double figures and it will be interesting to see just who survives the axe.",
      "Ahead of this afternoon's game at Old Trafford, you can select the United XI you would like to see Ruben Amorim name by using our interactive selector widget:",
      "The final day of the Premier League season means that all 20 clubs kick-off at the same time. With the exception of the Champions League places to decide, everything else is settled.",
      "Here is a reminder of today's fixtures (all kick-offs 4pm):",
      "After what happened in Bilbao on Wednesday night, United's players will be wishing they didn't have to play this game today.",
      "The 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur marked the end of United's hopes of salvaging something from what has been a forgettable campaign, meaning the result this afternoon, whatever it is, will count for nothing.",
      "United, if they fail to win, could finish just one place above the relegation zone. The potential sight of that come 6pm will be harrowing.",
      "United's supporters will still turn out in their numbers today, just as they always do, but they are unlikely to make any sort of racket. This season has been forgettable and the sooner it ends, the better.",
      "You can also follow live text updates with us on our matchday blog.",

      "It was seven years ago that three of us were beckoned to the doorframe of the Levi's Stadium press room in San Jose. Jose Mourinho stood in it.",
      "Mourinho stressed to the three of us he was prepared to let Anthony Martial leave Manchester United. Martial's agent, Philippe Lamboley, had outlined his intention to move only a month earlier.",
      "If a player wanted out, Mourinho was never going to stand in the way. But Ed Woodward did. He blocked Luke Shaw's sale that summer as well. Martial and Shaw would sign new contracts within the next six months.",
      "Martial outstayed his welcome at United and was released after nine years last year. Shaw is 11 years and counting. This is what happens when you undermine the United manager and erode the role's authority.",
      "So United supporters have to be sanguine with Ruben Amorim's decisive call on Alejandro Garnacho. Garnacho was told on Saturday he can leave.",
      "It was three strikes and you're out for the 20-year-old. Garnacho was dropped for the Manchester derby in December on account of his attitude and skulked down the tunnel following his first-half substitution against Ipswich Town in February. He paid for a team meal by way of an apology.",
      "Garnacho is still so young but should not be as juvenile as he is on social media. Erik ten Hag had to give him a ticking off last season over a tweet he liked from an account criticising his substitution against Bournemouth.",
      "When a 20-year-old sounds off about a \"s**t season\", criticises the manager's selection and casts doubt on his future, he should be ushered towards the door marked 'exit'. Garnacho was on raw form in the San Mames mixed zone and he was not the only United player who used the platform as an unburdening.",
      "Yet this is not the first time he has erred. Garnacho has developed an inflated sense of entitlement through his escapades with the youth team and first team. Generations change but managers should never allow any player, junior or senior, to ride roughshod over them. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did and one could never get past the image of him as a substitute teacher.",
      "On the night United won the FA Youth Cup in May 2022, the Old Trafford crowd sang \"Viva Garnacho\". Garnacho applauded nonchalantly, as though he expected it when he ought to have been almost overwhelmed.",
      "That is a measure of his self-belief and he will doubtless enhance whichever team he joins. Napoli, who bid for Garnacho unsuccessfully in January, are now Serie A champions. Their coach, Antonio Conte, deemed Garnacho worthy of replacing the classy Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Conte also oversaw one of Eden Hazard's greatest seasons at Chelsea.",
      "So United must be braced for more online barracking if or when Garnacho scores another stunner. Scott McTominay was voted Serie A's MVP at the weekend after Napoli clinched their fourth Scudetto.",
      "It is easy to say United were wrong to sell McTominay. They needed to redress the balance of their midfield and a defensive midfielder was essential. Someone had to make way and McTominay was a sellable asset.",
      "It is not as though he was hugely in-demand. Fulham had bids rejected and Serie A has become a dumping ground for English clubs for six years. Yes, Inter Milan have reached the Champions League final again but they have Matteo Darmian and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in their squad. Romelu Lukaku, a cumbersome misfit at United and Chelsea, leads the line for Napoli.",
      "The sale of McTominay looks worse now as United have got worse. His de facto replacement, Manuel Ugarte, was dropped for the Europa League final and has not looked remotely ready to anchor the United midfield. On his last start for United, McTominay was the glue between the midfield and attack in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "Garnacho turns 21 in July and was tagged not-for-sale by United last year. Much has changed in less than 12 months. He has had his nose put out of joint by Ten Hag's sacking and the arrival of a coach who does not operate with specialist wingers was bound to jeopardise his future. Garnacho has scored more goals under Ten Hag than Amorim this term.",
      "The pity is Amorim and Garnacho tried to make it work. Amorim enthused about the inroads made by Garnacho after his derby omission. Garnacho has been named in every United squad since. He went in one direction and Marcus Rashford headed off in the polar opposite.",
      "Less than three weeks ago, Garnacho flanked Amorim at Carrington and said he was happy to remain at United next season. One disappointment in Bilbao changed all of that and he should have known from the derby that Amorim does not suffer fools gladly.",
      "Like Mourinho. The difference is Amorim will get his way."

      "With nothing but trying to avoid finishing one place above the relegation zone on the line for United this afternoon, changes are increasingly likely from Amorim. Evans will be leaving at the end of his contract and it would be fitting for him to make his final appearance for United at Old Trafford.",

      "Aston Villa are chasing Champions League qualification and they will smell blood when they arrive at Old Trafford, so here are the five things to look for on the final day of the season.",
      "This disastrous season has shown the majority of players in the dressing room are not good enough to represent United and the squad must be gutted in the summer. It will be pointless to start players against Aston Villa who are likely to leave and a handful of debuts should be handed out.",
      "Fans would rather watch academy prospects give their all against Aston Villa than players who have been responsible for this season, and it will be the only interesting aspect of the game.",
      "Bendito Mantato, Jaydan Kamason and Godwill Kukonki are obvious candidates to make their debuts after spending time around the first-team, but others could be involved as well.",
      "Chido Obi should also be given his first start at Old Trafford after making substitute appearances. Amorim has described Obi as \"naive\" on two occasions, but nothing can be lost by starting him.",
      "It's become a tradition to make an end-of-season speech at Old Trafford on the final day of the season, but whether Amorim addresses the crowd after Aston Villa remains to be seen.",
      "Amorim is an impressive communicator, but results have certainly not been impressive since his appointment in November. It will be fascinating to see whether Amorim picks up the microphone and what he says if he does.",
      "Is there much for Amorim to add after a bleak campaign? He's probably said it all in press conferences and interviews, and might feel it's best to avoid a speech on Sunday.",
      "The players usually applaud each corner of Old Trafford to thank supporters after the final home game of the season, but there might not be any fans remaining in the stadium to applaud.",
      "United have been shocking this season and the players will sheepishly walk around the pitch after full-time. They will have apologetic faces, but they are guaranteed to struggle for sympathy from the stands.",
      "The fans who actually decide to stay will be angry and it could become pretty toxic.",
      "The anger among supporters is also expected to be palpable before kick-off, as a protest against the Glazers has been organised by The 1958. Avram Glazer sat alongside Sir Jim Ratcliffe to watch the Europa League final in Bilbao on Wednesday and removing the American family remains the target for fan groups.",
      "The 1958 have reiterated they want the Glazers \"out\" because \"they were never welcome\", and fans have been asked to join the fresh protest against the Glazers before the Aston Villa game.",
      "There should be a healthy turnout for the protest, especially after the Europa League final, which had the potential to paper over the cracks and influence fan sentiment toward ownership.",
      "United have suffered a staggering 20 defeats in all competitions this season, which is their most in a campaign since losing 22 in 1973/74, when they were relegated from the top-flight.",
      "Amorim has amassed several unwanted records during his first season in Manchester and could make more history against Aston Villa. For example, United last suffered four league defeats in a row the same season in February 1979, and they could do that for the first time in 46 years on Sunday.",
      "United could also lose as many as half of their league games in a season for the first time since 1933/34 when they were in the second tier. They last did so in the top flight in 1930/31."

      "After a bright cameo in Bilbao, Garnacho lamented United's \"s**t\" season and questioned Amorim's decision to bench him. The 20-year-old added \"we'll see\" when his future was raised. Garnacho's brother, Roberto, claimed he had been \"thrown under a bus\".",
      "When asked about Garnacho on Saturday, Amorim said: \"I always speak to my players, but the focus now is on the last game. I don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"We have a plan and we prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without. We have an idea what type of squad we want, but now we have to focus on the last game and we will have time address all of those situations.\"",
      "United rejected a £40million offer from Italian champions Napoli for Garnacho in the winter transfer window and he is under contract at United until 2028. The club is expected to hold out for a higher fee than what Napoli offered.",
      "Garnacho was listed among a handful of United players not for sale last year but the arrival of Amorim has largely worked against the Argentina international. Garnacho has started 25 times under Amorim and made 15 more appearances off the bench.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho and Marcus Rashford from the Manchester derby squad on December 15 on account of their attitude. Rashford has not played for United since but Garnacho was picked in every matchday squad.",
      "After Garnacho was substituted in the first half of United's win against Ipswich Town in February, he headed straight down the tunnel. Amorim later said Garnacho had offered to pay for a team dinner by way of an apology.",

I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Garnacho has operated as one of the two playmakers in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and United expect to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Mount, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo are among the other existing options.",
      "United co-chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe said in March no player would be sold for financial reasons when the futures of Garnacho and Mainoo were raised. Garnacho would represent a pure profit for United under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules, having come through their academy.",
      "Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid at the age of 16 in 2020. He scored seven goals, including two in the final, of their last FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022 and made his first-team debut in April of that year under Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Garnacho has played 144 times for United and scored 26 goals."

      "Shortly before it emerged that Alejandro Garnacho had been informed to find a new club this summer, Ruben Amorim answered two questions about him at a press conference.",
      "Amorim was non-committal about Garnacho and insisted his focus was on facing Aston Villa.",
      "Then Amorim was asked about Garnacho again in the embargoed section, and he reiterated: \"Guys, everything I have to say, I say it to the players, I did that in the past and you know.",
      "\"I’ve been here for six months and continue to do that, so let’s focus on the next game.\"",
      "Amorim could have revealed that Garnacho's time was up in Manchester, but he preferred to give a diplomatic answer on his future, which some of his predecessors wouldn't have done.",
      "Now that the cat is out of the bag, Amorim might be more forthcoming about Garnacho in his post-Aston Villa press conference because it's bound to be at the top of the agenda on Sunday.",
      "Amorim has made a decision on Garnacho. He made a decision on Marcus Rashford in December. All United managers worth their salt need to be capable of making such seismic decisions.",
      "Only time will tell whether Amorim has made the right decision on Garnacho, and he was ironically asked about academy graduates succeeding after leaving the club on Saturday afternoon.",
      "The likes of Scott McTominay, Dean Henderson and Anthony Elanga have enjoyed tremendous seasons, and Amorim admitted their performances serve as a 'warning' about selling academy graduates.",
      "\"It's always a warning because we need to get the recruitment right, that is clear,\" Amorim said. \"And again, some players played here and they had opportunities and then they go away and they flourish.",
      "\"That can happen. We need to look at our team, imagine a way of playing, put the right players in position to improve as a team because if one team is playing well, all the players are going to play well.",
      "\"So we need to build a strong core to have to support all the kids that come from the academy, and we have a lot to do, but that is normal because they are quality players. They go to some places and they flourish. That can happen.\"",
      "Amorim discussed the pitfalls of selling graduates on the same day he informed Garnacho, one of the biggest recent success stories from the academy, that he should find a new club.",
      "That suggests Amorim is comfortable and at ease with his decision to move him on this summer.",
      "United will have to reinvest the money they receive for Garnacho, but there has been little evidence that the club can recruit well. \"Of course, I believe and we are improving,\" said Amorim about signing players.",
      "\"We are improving in the data that we want. We have a rule that is not just a manager that chooses, there has to be connection. There is no player that comes here without my approval, but the opposite is the same. That is important for not just one manager to control everything.",
      "\"We are putting all these things to improve the recruitment. For me, the important thing in the recruitment is to know how we are going to play, and that is really clear, and you can see we have a new point every time the way we play, but we have a clear idea how to play.",
      "\"If you have a clear idea how to play, you can point the specific players that you want for that position, and that is clear, and we are doing that together with all the data, the physical data to cope with the demands of the Premier League.",
      "\"All these things are taken care of, so we want to improve and sometimes you don't have 100 per cent certainty because you have the adaptation to every player, but we are doing all the steps to improve on that aspect of our club.\"",
      "Amorim has taken on a huge challenge in Manchester, the extent of which he wasn't aware of until he actually walked through the door. \"I already talked about that. I didn’t regret,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I suffer like any Mancunian suffers to see all the things. Yes, the problems for me was deeper than I was thinking because I can watch, I can feel it during trainings at Carrington, all our organisation, then it’s not the problems, but the stability in our club. Everybody is changing.",
      "\"All the departments are changing, so we did that in one year. In six months, we are doing everything, so everything is more difficult, but I think we are getting some steps to improve things. You cannot see that because results are so poor, but we are in a better place, that I can guarantee you.\"",
      "When asked if United are now in a better position, Amorim said: \"I think it’s healthier, it’s a way to put it. You cannot see it with the results, we have worse results, but I think we are in a better place as a club with the small things that will be big things in the future.",
      "\"So it’s hard to explain everything. I don’t want to touch on every point, but yes, we are in a better place. I am not happier because it’s impossible to be happier, especially after Wednesday and with our results and form in the league.",
      "\"So I’m not happier, I am suffering like everybody, but I know what we are doing and that gives me positivity and confidence for the future. It’s hard to explain [having confidence].",
      "\"I know you guys are talking all the time and people don’t just want to hear the same things. I think I have the same principles, I have the same rules. With winning, that I knew because winning in Portugal is a different world to winning in England.",
      "\"But even losing, I have the same idea, the same rules and I know what way we want to do it, what kind of players we want, so that gives me confidence because I don’t lose myself. I know what to do, and then time will tell with results because that will need to change.\"",
      "Amorim's press conference will be worth listening to again after Aston Villa on Sunday evening."

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a playful reference to his ban from attending Nottingham Forest's City Ground this afternoon for their crucial clash against Chelsea.",
      "Both Forest and Chelsea are battling for a place in next season's Champions League this afternoon. If the East Midlands club win, they only need a club above them to drop points to seal a spot at European football's top table.",
      "Should Chelsea be victorious, they would secure Champions League football. Anything less and they will be watching what happens at Old Trafford with Aston Villa pushing for a spot in the top five.",
      "With so many eyeballs expected to be on Forest, Sky had planned for the match to take precedence and had therefore looked to gain accreditation for Neville to join Peter Drury in the gantry. But taking to social media this weekend, the former United captain confirmed he had been banned.",
      "\"Personally, I think it’s disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision. Whilst they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it’s symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club.",
      "\"I wish the coaching staff, players and fans of the club all the best in their quest to achieve Champions League football.\" Neville has been critical of Forest recently having blasted them for threatening legal action against the Premier League for a referee error last season.",
      "He was also critical of Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis for confronting Nuno Espirito Santo after the draw with Leicester City. However, it appears that Neville is not taking the decision too seriously after he joked about it on his social channels.",
      "After United shared a video of Neville making his debut against Coventry City, the 50-year-old shared it to his Instagram story, accompanied with the caption: \"From my debut on the final day back in 1994 to being banned on the final day in 2025!",
      "It is unclear whether Neville will feature at all on Sky's coverage this afternoon but it is claimed the production of the match is being moved to Sky's studios in London."

      "Garnacho replaced Mason Mount in the 71st minute of the Europa League final against Tottenham, and he expressed his frustration when he spoke after the 1-0 defeat.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" said Garnacho. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Garnacho uploaded a photo of himself scoring in last season's FA Cup final on Instagram. It appeared to suggest he'd been omitted from the starting XI, and Garnacho was confirmed to be on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames when the team news was revealed.",
      "Fernandes has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in the summer. United sources recently insisted they had no plans to sell Fernandes, but a huge offer from Al-Hilal might be difficult to turn down.",
      "The 30-year-old looked crestfallen as he collected his runners-up medal after defeat to Tottenham, and he also spoke honestly about his future to journalists in the mixed zone after the game.",
      "Speaking at his pre-Aston Villa press conference, Amorim was asked about the futures of Garnacho and Fernandes and said: \"I always speak to my players, but the focus now is on the last game.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen. We have a plan and we prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without. We have an idea what type of squad we want, but now we have to focus on the last game and we will have time address all of those situations.\"",
      "When asked whether the Europa League final had changed his opinion on some players, Amorim responded: \"No, what changes is one less competition, that game in the middle of the week.",
      "\"You can manage the squad in a different way, so that rotation of the players, the depth of the squad, that changes completely if you have three or four competitions.",
      "\"That changes a little bit the plan, but not the way I look at my players just by looking at the final.\"",
      "Chelsea and Napoli were both interested in signing Garnacho in the January transfer window.",
      "Sales of academy graduates are classified as 'total profit' within Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Concerns have been raised about Garnacho's attitude. In February, he apologised to his United teammates after storming off down the tunnel at Old Trafford when he was substituted against Ipswich Town.",
      "Fernandes will turn 31 in September and Al-Hilal might test United's stance on their captain after missing out on the signing of Mohamed Salah, who extended his Liverpool contract."

      "\"We suffer a goal near the half-time and try everything in the second half, but it was really hard because like I said before the match, if you don’t win the final, it’s really harder to deal with that.\"",

      "\"The way we can get up is to focus on the next game, to finish in a good way. When you start thinking about the future and the squad, a new season is going to start, and we will start with new ambitions and try to do better.",
      "\"I think these six months were really hard, a lot of changes, not just for me, but for all of the club. We did so many changes inside the club, sometimes it takes like five years or three years to change all the personnel and a lot of things. We changed coach in the middle of the season and we changed the way we play.",

      "Luke Chadwick can still remember the first time. He was a Manchester United youngster on loan at Antwerp in Belgium and finally starting to feel like a professional footballer. He was playing regularly, playing well, and loving his time there.",
      "He was such a part of the club that he was asked to do an interview with a national newspaper. Then just 19, he hadn't done any media training at United and hated speaking to the press, but he did it and stumbled his way through it. He went out and bought a copy of the newspaper to see what kind of rave review he was going to get.",
      "\"I don’t even know why I bought it because I can’t speak Flemish, I can’t read it, but there was a couple of words in there I could get,\" said Chadwick.",
      "In fairness, it didn't take a lot of translating. 'Dentures a la Bugs Bunny,' was one. There were several references to 'acne'. Chadwick's heart sank.",
      "\"I wanted to go and get all the copies so no one else could read it. It was just a really unpleasant, uncomfortable feeling. It was like I was embarrassed for myself, I'm embarrassed that loads of people are going to see what this person has wrote about me and I just felt, I don't know, I struggled to let it go out of my mind, it was always just there, it was something I just kept thinking about.\"",
      "Chadwick first touched on the issues he had felt when his looks became such a part of the public consciousness in a social media post during lockdown in 2020. He talks about it candidly again in his new book, Not Just A Pretty Face, and more than two decades on from when he became an unwitting celebrity for something other than his football, he is unflinchingly honest about how it made him feel.",
      "After his post five years ago, he received apologies from Nick Hancock and Gary Lineker for their part in the mickey-taking on the TV game show 'They Think It’s All Over', but he said it was unnecessary then and is still unnecessary now. He holds no bitterness towards the people involved, and if anything seems more self-critical, that he was unable to understand why it was making him feel the way he did.",
      "\"I felt quite helpless about it because I'd never open up, I'd never talk about it because I didn't have the self-awareness to do it, I didn't have the emotional intelligence to say 'this is bothering me',\" said Chadwick, who never had an issue with how he looked.",
      "“When you don't do that, it just gets worse and worse and it's just a vicious circle. When I got back to England and it got worse, I just thought that that's all I am, I'm just a picture of fun, someone that looks funny to people, that doesn't look how a footballer or anyone should look.",
      "\"The biggest challenge was how I was with myself because I treated myself so unkindly about it, I wouldn't give myself a break, it was like ‘Why are you letting this affect you?\"",
      "Chadwick refused to speak to friends and family about the issue and insisted all was fine, but inside things got so bad that as his career as a United player came to an end in 2004, he could see an upside in disappearing out of the public eye a little.",
      "\"I'd just try and sweep it to the back of my mind, I wouldn't speak to my family about it, I wouldn't speak to my girlfriend about it, I wouldn't speak to my friends if anyone said anything about it,\" he said.",
      "\"I'd just sort of say, 'don't bother me, it's funny', laugh along with it and that sort of thing, where inside it was eating away at me and I think it got to a point when I did leave that it was quite a relief to be out and where not many people are as bothered about you when you're playing in the Championship.\"",
      "Chadwick reflects on that time in the early 2000s as a big part of his journey and something that has helped him understand his own mental health and how important it is to open up.",
      "\"It's a massive part of my life and my self-development, in terms of going through that has allowed me to understand my thoughts and feelings, my mental health a lot better, and to be able to deal with that,\" he said.",
      "\"I just thought I was weak, stop being weak, which was the completely wrong way to think about it, but unfortunately, that's how I was at the time, and I thought I can't be vulnerable, the only people that are are weak people, which is completely wrong.",
      "\"It's still going on that journey of learning about yourself that being vulnerable is the only way we can deal with challenging situations and to talk out and to speak about them.\"",
      "Chadwick met with the MEN at Hotel Football. He was recognised by one young fan who asked for a selfie, but the 44-year-old revealed that when he returns to Manchester and the stadium he graced for a few years, he struggles to piece together that young footballer and the man he is now.",
      "\"When I look back now and walk past Old Trafford, I cannot believe that I used to play in that stadium and the enormity of it now is much bigger than when you're actually in it,\" he said.",
      "\"I definitely didn't appreciate it. I think it's hard as a 19 or 20-year-old kid to really appreciate what you're doing and know that you're in a very privileged situation.",
      "\"I recognise that you've got to be very special to stay at Man United for a long period of time, but it's more football in general, you're doing something you love doing, but it's something where you're never satisfied, you're never really happy.",
      "\"There's always something good that happens, but then it's on to the next one and you never really get that satisfaction. I've done something that I've loved doing. I've played at Old Trafford a few times. It's crazy.\"",
      "Chadwick's book is searingly honest and full of humour and the title reveals he is not afraid of poking a little fun at himself as well. It also reveals a footballer who never lost his love of the game.",
      "He was with Arsenal when United approached him about a trial at the age of 14. Although a Cambridge United fan, he followed Manchester United thanks to the emergence of young players like Ryan Giggs, and when offered the chance of a week-long trial, he jumped at it.",
      "He met Alex Ferguson on the final day and scored in front of the Scot. He felt he had done well and chewed over the week on the train back to his Cambridgeshire village where he was picked up by his mum.",
      "\"When she picked me up, I got in the car and she said that Alex Ferguson had phoned her up and asked if I would sign,\" remembers Chadwick.",
      "\"I thought she was mucking about to start with, but to get that there was only one club I was going to. I was so scared though because I had to tell Arsenal.\"",
      "They didn't want to take no for an answer, so youth team boss Terry Murphy told manager Bruce Rioch, and they turned up at the Chadwick residence to make their case.",
      "\"We sat with Bruce and Terry knowing that I was going to sign for United,\" said Chadwick. \"As soon as United offered me something, I was never going to go [back to Arsenal]. I didn't tell Bruce that, I just said I needed a bit of time to think about it. I think I got my mum to phone up Terry in the end.",
      "\"Arsenal was obviously a brilliant football club, but I didn't really enjoy it that much, going there training on a Wednesday night, going into London, going to Highbury. Some brilliant players, the coaches were great, but I was so shy and introverted back then, I was really uncomfortable, I really disliked playing with people that I wasn’t comfortable with.",
      "\"At United it was just the way that you were made to feel, you just immediately felt even as a 14 year old kid part of something really special and I absolutely loved it and felt so different, I didn't feel as shy or as introverted, I felt really comfortable because of the way that the coaches were and they were so enthusiastic, they were so happy to see us kids that were there as well and I just fell in love with it straight away.\"",
      "Chadwick was scouted and signed as a striker, but he lacked the physical strength to play up front and was turned into a hard-working winger by Eric Harrison.",
      "As he progressed through the ranks, there was a little excitement and expectation in the air around Chadwick, and he admits he got \"big-headed\" at one point. He was then dropped for an FA Youth Cup tie against Blackburn and brought back down to earth.",
      "He did crack the first team. He made 39 appearances and scored two goals, both in the Premier League, one of which was the clear highlight of his time at the club.",
      "\"I think the one that I still dine out on today was scoring at Elland Road. I think that goal was the best three-yard tap-in of all time,\" he said. \"I came on at half-time because I think Nicky Butt got injured in a re-jig in midfield, and Nigel Martyn was one of the best goalies in the Premier League at the time but he had an absolute stinker that day.",
      "\"I remember just tapping it in and running off like a lunatic. I was just euphoric. I remember warming up in the first half constantly, because I think Butty had a problem early on and the dogs abuse I was getting when I was running up and down that touch line.",
      "“It just felt like when I scored, I was just absolutely buzzing that I'd scored at their end as well.\"",
      "Chadwick can also remember the game when he realised he was done at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I think when I realised that my time was coming to an end, I came on off the bench. It was against Olympiakos [in October 2002] and we were winning 2-0. I came on as a double sub with Quinton Fortune with about 20 minutes to go.",
      "\"I'd just come back from being off for a couple of months with problems with my groin and pelvis and I felt like I just couldn't get out of third gear.",
      "\"They came back, made it 2-2, and I was thinking 'that's because I've come on, we were winning 2-0'. I remember Scholesy scored a worldie to make it 3-2 at the end so we ended up winning but I just sort of sat in the dressing room after that game thinking, ‘I'm just not at the level here, I need to get my injury sorted’ and I think I just need to start a different challenge, something where I can feel like I'm offering a lot more than I was at the time.\"",
      "While Chadwick contributed to the United cause on the pitch, in a way, it's the daily training sessions he remembers and the standards set then that made the days in between games even more challenging.",
      "\"Every day was so intense,\" he said. \"I remember the season when I was in and around it and sort of played a few games, didn't start many, which meant if you weren't playing you'd train more or less every day for the Champions League and everything, and at the end of the season I was just absolutely exhausted, like physically and mentally, because it was just so, so intense every day.",
      "\"You've got 25 of the best players in the country, and they're all desperate to win the training games and everything. The amount that helps you as a young player, and the lessons I learned from the club are what allowed me to go and have a career in professional football.",
      "\"It was such a steep learning curve, it's given everything every day, and that's what created the success of the club.\"",
      "Chadwick's career eventually ended at his boyhood club, and he admits he struggled with the end of his playing career.",
      "\"I didn't really know what I was going to do, and mentally I just lost all of my identity,\" he said. \"I'd always been a footballer and I thought ‘that’s the best part of life over now’. It's all going to be rubbish now. I'm just going to get old. What do old footballers do? Become coaches.\"",
      "But he didn't enjoy it. The kid who loved football and maintained that passion throughout his career now found himself moaning at referees and the children he coached. He admits he \"hated the person\" he had become at football.",
      "A business opportunity with former colleagues attracted him to the Football Fun Factory, a project offering fun football to children that he is now passionate about.",
      "\"I was seven or eight and I signed for my first grassroots club called Melbourn Tigers. I remember the coaches were called Colin and Martin and I still remember them to this day, they made it so much fun and they were probably the most important coaches, because if I didn't get them positive early experiences I probably wouldn't have become a professional footballer. I wouldn't still love football.",
      "\"It's so important so the opportunity to do that on a mass scale, so tens and thousands of children are joining the Football Fun Factory programs and falling in love with football really captured my imagination.\"",
      "It is back where the journey began for Chadwick."

      "A hamstring injury has, however, seen him miss the last four games in all competitions. United host Villa at Old Trafford in this afternoon’s season finale. With Rashford not eligible to play against his parent club, it means his season is over.",

He posted pictures of what looks like an individual training session at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training ground with the caption reading: “Outside running again! 79% of my maximum speed. The comeback is always better than the setback.”",
      "United have made him available for a fee of £40 million, and Villa do not have first refusal on the player. Sources close to Rashford also say that he is not prepared to take a wage cut on his £325,000-a-week salary.",

      "In the same week that Manchester United fell short in the Europa League final, Scott McTominay rounded-off a sensational debut season in Italy by winning the Serie A title.",
      "McTominay said farewell to Old Trafford last summer after coming through their academy. Napoli paid £21million for his services with a potential £4.2m in add-ons. Under 12 months later, it proved to be one of the best transfers of the season.",
      "The midfielder scored 29 goals in 255 games for United - despite being played outside of his natural position at times. This season, he has bagged 13 goals and, on Friday night, he scored the first in Gli Azzurri's 2-0 win against Cagliari, crowning them champions of Italy.",
      "Napoli, who won the Serie A title in 2023 owing in the main to Victor Osimhen's goals, have turned a page under Antonio Conte. The signings of David Neres, Romelu Lukaku, McTominay and Billy Gilmour all had question marks over them, although they no longer exist now.",
      "At the time, a switch to Naples made sense for both McTominay and United. Manuel Ugarte arrived to boost Erik ten Hag's midfield from Paris Saint-Germain - after it was established that more \"grit\" was needed in the middle of the park.",
      "The Uruguay international has done well in his first season but Ruben Amorim - who didn't sign him but worked with him at Sporting CP - kept him places on the bench on Wednesday night. McTominay wouldn't look amiss in this United team.",
      "\"When I got into the first team, I was quite mis-profiled in where I was playing,\" he said in an interview with The Athletic. \"It wasn't the fault of any coaches. My strengths have always been getting into the box, scoring goals, being a problem in there. But I was being used as a No.6, or as a centre-back, and that has never really been my game.",
      "\"But when you're playing for Manchester United, and you're 20-years-old, you can't knock on the manager's door and say that you expect to be playing at No.8 ahead of Paul Pogba, it's not realistic. You have to know your place, and do what you're asked to do. In the last few seasons, I began to get into the box a bit more, and to score more goals, and then last year was my best one.\"",
      "If McTominay was in this current United team, then his quality would be there to demand a place in his preferred position. In fact, he's the latest player to leave the club and have success away from Manchester.",
      "Dean Henderson, Mason Greenwood, Alvaro Carreras, Antony, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga have all impressed once they have left the club. McTominay, who maybe wasn't a player many would have liked to see stay, has proved in the last season that he is - perhaps - the biggest transfer mistake made by Ineos."

      "Manchester United are facing a huge summer in their rebuild under Ruben Amorim after a desperately poor 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Amorim head into the final weekend of the Premier League in 16th place and then failed to take their lifeline in the Europa League in midweek.",
      "Defeat to Tottenham in the final in Bilbao not only saw United miss out on winning a European trophy but also a place in next season's Champions League.",
      "That has meant United have missed out on millions in potential prize money and revenue next season as they gear up for a season without European football next term.",
      "That being said, they must make some changes this summer in the transfer market and United are understood to be ready to back Defeat to Tottenham in the window.",
      "But they will have to rebalance the books and sell some players to make some headway to ensure the club don't fall foul of profit and sustainability rules.",
      "With that in mind, we have taken a look at United's three biggest transfer jobs facing them this summer",
      "Cunha is available to leave Wolves this summer and United are preparing to pay the £62.5million release clause to sign him.",
      "United are expecting to seal the signing of the 17-goal forward imminently and Amorim is keen to deploy the 25-year-old in one of this two attacking midfield slots in his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Delap has scored 12 goals for a relegated side this season and is available to sign for £30million. United are one of a number of clubs interested, and he has started to hold talks with interested parties, but they are hopeful they can convince the England under-21 international to lead their line next term.",
      "If United push through those moves that will see them part with £92.5million which represents a significant chunk of their budget.",
      "United will need a midfielder and possible upgrades at right-back and in goal. Former United midfielder Paul Scholes also suggested they need a more experienced forward too, even if they sign Delap.",
      "That is going to be expensive and United may struggle to make their budget stretch to solve all of their transfer priorities.",
      "That is where sales in the summer will be key for United to fund their rebuild.",
      "A number of players could leave Old Trafford but we understand the sales of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho have been prioritised to kickstart their summer clearout.",
      "All three players have tasted success on loan this season with Aston Villa, Real Betis and Chelsea respectively and will be in demand this summer.",
      "United have priced Rashford at £40million, Antony will be available for around £32.5m while Chelsea have an obligation to buy Sancho for a fee as high as £25m.",
      "That would see United bring in £97.5million in transfer sales before they even countenance any more sales. Casemiro could be sold amid interest from the Saudi Pro League, while Rasmus Hojlund could also be sold.",
      "Altay Bayindir is expected to leave, while there is also interest in Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. While their sales would not be popular, they would represent pure profit for United in the eyes of PSR.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to his 3-4-2-1 system since being appointed as manager but it is now clear that a number of United players just aren't suited to it.",
      "He will welcome pre-season for extended time on the training pitch to continue to bed in his ideas and no European football will help Amorim with that, too.",
      "But for him to succeed there clearly needs to be wholesale changes but any club would struggle to withstand too much change in one summer. That is a dilemma Amorim must manage to balance next season as the scrutiny over his role inevitably increases."

      "The sight of Leny Yoro's name among the starters at the San Mames Stadium on Wednesday evening immediately increased the confidence levels of Manchester United's supporters with 75 minutes to go until kick-off.",
      "After the Frenchman had recovered from a foot injury in time to be included in the 26-man squad Ruben Amorim named for the trip to Bilbao, United's supporters crossed their fingers in the hope of seeing him make the starting XI.",
      "Much to their delight, he was deemed fit enough to start the Europa League final and he lined up on the right of the back-three, joining forces with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw in defence.",
      "The Frenchman had suffered a foot injury ten days prior to the final, being forced off in United's 2-0 home defeat to West Ham United, and missed the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge five days later, with Amorim admitting he was in a battle against the clock to be fit in time.",
      "Ultimately, despite winning his fitness battle and becoming United's youngest starter in a European final since Brian Kidd back in 1968, it did not make a difference to the outcome.",
      "Brennan Johnson's first half winner sealed Spurs their first trophy in 17 years and condemned United to a second Europa League final defeat in five seasons. It also ended their aspirations of competing in the Champions League next season.",
      "United's powder-puff performance at the San Mames was symbolic of their season, meaning it has put immense strain on their plans for this summer's transfer window.",
      "Champions League qualification would have banked United a minimum of around £85million, meaning they will be guided through this summer's transfer window by Plan B instead.",
      "Understandably, the mood among United's supporters is at an all-time low. Many are sick to the back teeth of this current squad and would happily see Amorim take a sledgehammer to it this summer.",
      "As welcomed as that would be, it is simply unrealistic. United will not be able to oversee the volume of changes that are necessary in just one window.",
      "Instead, it means any hopes of the squad being completely gutted will be on hold. There will, of course, be departures, but not on the scale that is necessary.",
      "United plan for the number of departures to reach double figures. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are expected to be released and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Others, too, will follow them out the door. In truth, there are very few within the squad that should be safe from axe being wielded.",
      "However, there are three members of Amorim's squad that should be safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit this summer, with Yoro being one of them. The 19-year-old was United's most eye-catching signing last summer, with the Reds beating Real Madrid to his signature.",
      "He had a delayed start to his Old Trafford career after fracturing his metatarsal in pre-season, but he has since shown plenty of flashes of the defender United believe he can become. He is equally comfortable on both the right and the left of the back-three and his ball-playing credentials are impressive for a player still so young.",
      "Amad, who has also not been without injury problems this season, is another United should refuse to entertain any offers for. He has excelled under Amorim and was the only player who looked like making anything happen in Bilbao.",
      "Equally capable as a right wing-back or as a right-sided No.10, the Ivorian has excelled under Amorim's coaching methods. His hunger and desire to beat his man and make something happen inside the final third gets United's supporters out of their seats in anticipation that something will happen.",
      "United have always been blessed with players who are natural entertainers and Amad fits that criteria. The club tied him down to a new contract earlier this year and he will be key to Amorim's long-term plans to try and take United forward.",
      "Despite being 11 years Yoro's senior and eight years older than Amad, Bruno Fernandes is another player United should be ensuring is central to Amorim's thinking. No amount of words will sum up the Portuguese's importance, and this season would have been even worse without him.",
      "Outside of those three, you fear no-one else is safe from potentially being offloaded, and that even includes Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho."

The Scotland international, who departed United last summer for just £25 million, has been instrumental in Antonio Conte's side pipping Inter to the Scudetto.",
      "Both teams dropping points the previous weekend saw an enthralling final day set up with Napoli at home to Cagliari and Simone Inzaghi's side away to Como.",
      "Napoli entered the clash top of the table by one point with a victory seeing them win the league for the second time in three seasons and McTominay, as he had already done on 11 separate occasions, stepped up to the plate with a huge goal.",
      "Just before half time, the 28-year-old scored a stunning overhead kick to put Napoli in front. Romelu Lukaku, another former United player, doubled his side's advantage in the second half. Inter also won 2-0 but Napoli picking up all three points meant they were forced to settle for second.",
      "Given his stellar contributions, McTominay was named Serie A MVP for the season and his comments following that were certainly telling.",
      "\"I'm lost for words,\" he said. \"It's incredible you know, the sacrifice that every single player in the group has put forward to the cause.",
      "\"And the people deserve it because they've been behind us from day one, and for me to come and experience this is a dream.\" Fernandes meanwhile, was able to find some words to describe his old midfield partner with the United captain hugely praising his character.",
      "On his Instagram story, he wrote: \"Congrats my friend [red heart emoji]. Resilience, determination and discipline have always been there from you! Now with confidence your qualities are shining more than ever [flexed arm emoji].",

He's still young and he still plans to be with the Under-21s of Wales as well, but I think it will be really good to spend some time with us in Toronto.\"",

The striker position is competitive with us, but he’s still young, and I think he could have the opportunity to establish himself as a flexible player in the way we play, a little bit like how [Lille and Canada forward] Jonathan David plays.”",
      "Biancheri has taken part in several first-team training sessions at Carrington, but he hasn't been named in a matchday squad, despite building an impressive goalscoring record at United.",
      "Biancheri has been the most prolific scorer in the academy this season - he has more goals than Chido Obi - and he possesses the quality to play in different attacking roles.",

This is astonishingly bad when compared to the likes of City, Real Madrid, and Benfica and even clubs like Brighton, Bournemouth, and Leverkusen.",

However, their current squad is valued at £516.3M, so somehow the value of their current players has decreased by nearly exactly 50%. My goodness, that’s shocking.",
      "If they were to sell their whole entire squad at a rate that they’ve been going (25% of full value), they will only be able to generate £129.1M which is based on the above patterns over the past five seasons. The BBC have also recently reported that United owe £272M in outstanding transfer payments to other clubs, £156M of which is due this summer. It’s not a stretch of a conclusion to say that selling their whole entire squad would not see off this summer’s bill alone.",
      "(Source: transfermarkt)",
      "Changing tack, over the past five seasons, United have paid their players, and wait for this, a staggering £1,040.3B. This season, United’s annual wage bill is £173.8M, but their commitment to the current players full contract lengths is a colossal £567.7M in future salary spend.",

If the future is bleak right now after the EUROPA League final defeat and sticking with a manager whose 3-4-3 formation is ill-suited to the Premier League and the players at his disposal, I think this could be just the start. The above indicates that United not only have to sell, but they have to sell at a 75% loss from transfer fees as well as hoping that buying clubs do not insist on United paying most of the outgoing player’s wages. And that’s just to avoid FPP sanctions if that is now even possible. Do not expect the ownership to gamble money they just don’t have on signings to keep them in the Premier League. Do not expect clubs to sell to United as they still owe transfer costs. Do not expect players to agree to move on without compensating the rest of their contracts. Expect to lose players for peanuts to offset this. Expect the club to make no new signings. Expect the club to rely on youth. Expect FFP points deductions.

At first, the “tartan” pattern (traditional to the region, per the Adidas marketing fluff) that makes the stripes’ edges look fuzzy from a distance looked wrong to me, but having checked out the closeup photos in the club’s webshop, it’s grown on me a good deal. The stripe treatment is really an elaboration of the 1995-96 grandad-collar kit, which featured a similar stitched-look border, and the subtle patterning of perforations (or black flecks) evident in the white stripes with the close-up shot on the club shop is rather cool.

I’ve seen a “deconstructed” monotone version of the current badge that would look very nice indeed. We may see two versions of this shirt if they make a decision soon. For this current shirt, I suspect they’ve lightened the blue of the badge banner a bit to match the blue highlights, but maybe it’s just a lighting thing.

Nike’s 2010-11 effort disagrees violently. The JVC and Dreamcast kits are classic, but largely for the sponsors; most of them were a little pants, with too much fussiness and elaboration with the red. I think Adidas should be looking back at the late 70s kits. Those are classics.",

Callum Davenport, by his own admission gave “this whopper in a Chinese takeaway container” for a stool sample as part of an internal investigation.",
      "The eventual conclusion was that a bout of norovirus tore through the squad but the accepted conspiracy is that Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe and company were felled by a dodgy lasagne at the last hurdle.",
      "",
      "9) 1999/2000\nThe comprehensive story threads were once again absent as this final day essentially hinged on one fixture with two direct consequences. Liverpool had a first Champions League campaign within reach, occupying fourth place but sitting behind Leeds and what was then the third and last European Cup spot that could be secured through league position. The Whites traipsed up to face an exciting West Ham side of Ferdinand, Lampard, Di Canio, Wanchope and Lomas, returning only with a goalless draw which offered Gerard Houllier and his Reds an unexpected opportunity.",
      "All they had to do was beat Bradford, who had spent all but a single gameweek since the start of January in the bottom three. That mattered nought when David Wetherall thundered a Gunnar Halle cross past Sander Westerveld in the first half, nor when the Bantams defended manfully to keep Michael Owen and Emile Heskey out, with Robbie Fowler omitted from the squad.",
      "Liverpool made the best of an inexplicably bad situation, embracing their UEFA Cup consolation so much it comprised one third of the subsequent season’s technical Treble. Bradford went down with a whimper in 2000/01 by comparison.",
      "",
      "8) 2006/07\nThe agenda was again dominated by events at the lower end. Sheffield United started in 16th, ahead of West Ham, Wigan and the pair of Charlton and Watford, whose relegations had already been confirmed. Three points separated as many teams when it came to taking up the last place on the second-tier scrapheap – and two of them were playing each other.",
      "Sheffield United could have avoided defeat at home to Wigan to render moot whatever result West Ham achieved at Old Trafford. But Paul Scharner scored after 14 minutes at the DW Stadium to make matters that little more agitated. Wigan and West Ham were staying up. Then uncle Jon Stead’s brave header swapped the Latics with the Blades.",
      "As half-time beckoned across the country, Carlos Tevez soaked himself in narrative to the delight of Neil Warnock, sending the Hammers clear. It became a straight shootout between Sheffield United and Wigan, who regained the lead at Bramall Lane when Phil Jagielka handled the ball; David Unsworth, a Blade until leaving that January on a free, and who had missed a penalty in a 0-0 draw against Blackburn the prior September, beat Paddy Kenny from 12 yards in first-half stoppage time. Danny Webber hit the post when through on goal. Lee McCulloch was sent off with 16 minutes remaining. But Wigan endured to send an embittered Warnock down.",
      "",
      "7) 1996/97\nAnother Champions League implosion from Liverpool proved to be a satisfactory entrée to a relegation-centred main course. The Reds had been a point behind Manchester United with a four-point and one-game buffer to Arsenal by late February, but dreadful form down the final straight – P10 W4 D3 L3 F14 A14 – obliterated that advantage. Defeat at Wimbledon in their penultimate match meant both Arsenal and Newcastle had closed to within two points of second place and the only other European Cup qualification spot alongside champions Manchester United.",
      "Arsenal beat Derby; Newcastle pummelled Nottingham Forest and increased their superior goal difference. Liverpool needed to win at Sheffield Wednesday but went behind to O’Neill Donaldson in the 75th minute and could only pull one back through Jamie Redknapp. All three sides finished on 68 points but Newcastle ventured to the Champions League while Arsenal and Liverpool were headed to the UEFA Cup.",
      "Middlesbrough, Coventry and Nottingham Forest occupied the bottom three places, with Forest already gone. Only Southampton and Sunderland were in reach and the door was opened when they lost at Aston Villa and Wimbledon respectively. Boro could only draw against Leeds and were made to rue their January points deduction, but Coventry took full advantage of the circumstances by beating Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Traffic problems meant that game had to be kicked off 15 minutes later than the rest – Jimmy Hill must have been proud – and player-manager Gordon Strachan later claimed to be “too nervous” to play as he remained an unused substitute. It kept him fit enough to leap into the welcoming arms of Dion Dublin at full-time.",
      "",
      "6) 1993/94\nManchester City were 16th on 44 points. Southampton were 17th on 42. Sheffield United were 18th on goals scored. Ipswich were 19th on goal difference. Everton were 20th on 41 points. Oldham were 21st on 39. Swindon Town were gone.",
      "Everton were 2-0 down at home to Wimbledon after 20 minutes, their predicament seemingly unsalvageable. Oldham led Norwich after 14 minutes but their inferior goal difference required Southampton, Sheffield United and Ipswich all to lose heavily. Manchester City were dragged in that little bit closer when Sheffield Wednesday went 1-0 up. Southampton fell behind to West Ham. By half-time, Sheffield United were beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and had four points and three teams between themselves and Everton. Manchester City equalised for the point they needed at Sheffield Wednesday. Southampton would concede a late Lee Chapman equaliser at West Ham but were clear.",
      "But Everton staged an improbable comeback to lead Wimbledon, thus taking Ipswich – drawing at Blackburn – down with Oldham. The Tractor Boys could do nothing to affect their own fate as they laboured to a stalemate, yet two late goals from Mark Stein at Chelsea, the last in stoppage time, spared them and put Sheffield United into the relegation zone for the first and most crucial time on the final day.",
      "",
      "No team had been relegated going into the final day and two points separated Norwich, Southampton, Crystal Palace and West Brom. The Canaries tumbled down the mine and gave the rest a chance by capitulating at Fulham. The other three were staying up at various points across the afternoon. Saints were ahead against Manchester United but were pegged back and then lost. Palace came from behind to lead Charlton before Jonathan Fortune’s late equaliser. West Brom started the day bottom, were stranded at Christmas and needed the rest to slip up, but capitalised through Geoff Horsfield and Kieran Richardson in the second half against Portsmouth. Some Pompey fans filtered onto the Hawthorns pitch upon realising that their defeat had helped relegate Southampton.",
      "It was absolute perfection that almost overshadowed Stuart Pearce sending David James on up front instead of actual striker Jon Macken as Manchester City chased a result in a UEFA Cup decider against Middlesbrough.",
      "",
      "4) 2002/03\nOn the line this time was Roman Abramovich’s heart. The media had dubbed Chelsea and Liverpool’s Champions League qualification showdown as ‘the £20m match’ but that barely covered a fraction of what was ultimately on offer.",
      "The Blues were fourth and had the Reds pipped on goal difference heading into a ludicrously poised last match at Stamford Bridge – winner takes all. Chelsea faced financial ruin if they failed. Sami Hyypia opened the scoring but Marcel Desailly almost immediately responded. Jesper Gronkjaer completed the turnaround within the half-hour and in doing so, intrinsically changed Chelsea’s future.",
      "Blackburn secured a UEFA Cup spot ahead of Everton by beating Tottenham 4-0, while the Toffees inevitably lost 2-1 to Manchester United despite Kevin Campbell’s best efforts.",
      "In terms of relegation, West Brom and Sunderland were adrift. It became a case of one out of three joining them, despite Leeds, Bolton and West Ham all having reached That Magical 40-point Mark. Leeds beat Aston Villa 3-1. Bolton beat Boro 2-1. West Ham could only draw 2-2 with Birmingham as they became Too Good To Go Down poster boys.",
      "",
      "3) 2021/22\nA vintage slice of final-day Barclays. Manchester City produced a title-winning conclusion mad enough to be the second maddest final day they’ve had, while Leeds leapfrogged Burnley to avoid the drop and, most astonishingly of all, Spurs never even threatened to Spurs things up for a single second as they cruised back into the Champions League.",
      "Of course, most eyes were fixed on the Etihad when all they had to do, with a one-point lead at the summit, was not balls it up against Villa. Not this brilliant Villa inspired by one of the greatest managerial upgrades ever; Steven Gerrard’s Villa. On paper, it should have been a procession. But City unexpectedly fell behind to Matty Cash and, while recklessly searching for an equaliser, they went 2-0 down thanks to Philippe Coutinho.",
      "Gerrard and Coutinho winning the title for Liverpool? Oh Lord.",
      "But Liverpool were struggling to take care of their own business. They were level with Wolves all the while City opened the door. Never once during the afternoon did the Reds move to the summit. By the time Mo Salah had come off the bench to put them ahead at Anfield, City had done a six-minute madness and the title was staying at the Etihad.",
      "The only significant last-day twist came at the bottom where Leeds, at Brentford, had to better Burnley’s result at home to Newcastle to leapfrog the Clarets and condemn them to relegation. Both games finished 2-1 in favour of Leeds, who went down with Sam Allardyce the following season anyway as Burnley climbed back up.",
      "",
      "2) 1994/95\nYou know exactly where this is going. It was, by definition of it subjectively being ranked second here, not the greatest of Premier League final days, but it was the first truly spectacular, fabric-altering one. It really was breathtaking when Brian Deane rifled in an excellent goal to equalise against Tottenham and secure the point Leeds needed to pip Newcastle to the last UEFA Cup place.",
      "There was a modicum of drama elsewhere. Jamie Redknapp scored a sublime last-gasp free-kick he dare not celebrate to beat Blackburn, the Premier League leaders who had been winning and heading for the title until John Barnes equalised in the 64th minute at Anfield. In doing so, Liverpool had betrayed club icon Kenny Dalglish and provided Manchester United with a gilt-edged chance.",
      "Alex Ferguson’s players had plenty of those against West Ham, of course. But let’s just say Ludek Miklosko need never buy his own pints in one half of Merseyside or Lancashire.",
      "",
      "1) 2011/12\nMartin Tyler receives some understandable criticism, such is his inherent bias against every team, but he absolutely nailed it here: that really was Aguerooooooooooooooo, and we surely will never see anything like this ever again. The most rudimentary explanation is that Manchester City had to only match Manchester United’s result at Sunderland when they hosted QPR to win their first Premier League title, and they did. That misses out a couple of key incidents and some absurd context but still.",
      "Chief conspiracy theorist Wayne Rooney covered the side of the bargain for Ferguson’s team with a routine back-post header at a pliably mid-table Sunderland. Pablo Zabaleta restored Manchester City’s advantage on goal difference with the opener against QPR. But Rangers, fuelled by a relegation battle and some residual resentment from manager Mark Hughes, sacked in acrimony by City two and a half years prior, took inexplicable control through Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie. It was the ultimate bottle job, until Edin Dzeko and some Argentinean fella staged a stoppage-time intervention.",
      "That alone would mark this final day out as the greatest. But there were layers playing out in the background, such as QPR staying up despite their own implosion and being able to freely celebrate with Manchester City as Bolton succumbed to a 77th-minute Jon Walters equaliser at Stoke. Arsenal gripped on to third place for dear life ahead of Tottenham, although it wasn’t until Chelsea won the Champions League six days later that Spurs learned fourth was only good enough for the Europa League. Because Spurs."

      "With season’s end now just around the corner, here’s a look at five managers who aren’t certain to take charge of their current clubs in the Premier League next campaign.",
      "Full disclosure: this has been quite significantly rewritten since we first had the idea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nObviously and entirely a madness, this one, and perhaps the single most egregious example of a manager becoming the victim of his own success at any non-promoted side. Even Leicester waited until it actually had gone to sh*t to get rid of Claudio Ranieri after he delivered the title.",
      "Yet there is plenty of talk now that should Nottingham Forest end up seventh when the music stops on Sunday afternoon then Nuno’s position could come under threat.",
      "There is absolutely no denying that finishing ‘only’ seventh from where they were a month ago would represent a disappointment and opportunity missed, but even allowing for the inevitable shifting of targets and expectations it seems utterly wild that Nuno could come under any pressure at all after a season that in the round remains a huge overachievement for a team that spent much of the last one in dire relegation trouble.",
      "But the fact it would be batsh*t doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Easy to forget it for much of this season, but Forest are quite batsh*t. Nuno is their eighth permanent manager in the last decade and already the second longest-serving.",
      "Owner Evangelos Marinakis is an emotional and volatile guy, and we’ve already seen him storming the pitch, brandishing his iPhone 7 and wired earphones, to admonish Nuno in the most public fashion possible after an admittedly quite irritating 2-2 draw with Leicester.",
      "Absolutely do not rule this out if Sunday doesn’t go to plan.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim (Man United)\nWe had two fairly strong convictions heading into the Europa League final: that Ruben Amorim was safe either way, and that Ange Postecoglou was doomed either way.",
      "We might have been wrong about both of those. Because it’s not just that Spurs won the final, it’s that Postecoglou so thoroughly won the battle of the managers as well, sitting Amorim down emphatically.",
      "The damning thing for Amorim is that when United are bad – and that is alarmingly often, including in the game they had decided many months ago was the one that would define their season – he is guilty of everything Ange stands accused of: stubborn, rigid adherence to a set way of doing things even when it’s demonstrably not working and the players aren’t buying into it.",
      "And while United played all their hits in Bilbao, never remotely looking like a team, defending incompetently, disappearing when the pressure was on, it was Ange and Spurs who showed the willingness to adapt and take the pragmatic approach to the reality in front of them.",
      "Shorn of their own main creative outlets, Spurs adopted a low-block-and-counter approach against United that they had deployed equally effectively to varying degrees when also keeping clean sheets in key knockout games at Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt.",
      "Amorim’s one concession to any deviation from his set plan appears to be ‘Chuck Harry Maguire up front and lump it in the mixer’. Look, we don’t hate it as, say, a Plan J or K and it is undeniably on occasion effective.",
      "But as a sole Plan B it’s, frankly, pish.",
      "Whoever lost the final was going to be in a bleak place after what was one of the highest-stakes games it’s possible to imagine given the extent to which both sides had sacked off everything else for this one night.",
      "There are different ways to lose, though. And United picked the worst possible one: an almost total failure to turn up at all against opposition with obvious, punishable frailties both deep-rooted and superficial, both physical and mental.",
      "Amorim got his selection wrong. Then he got his subs – or rather lack of subs – wrong. Bruno Fernandes had a horrible game and that’s a thing that can happen to any player at any time, fair enough, but did Amorim’s deployment of him in such a deep-lying position against such a deep-set opponent really give his best player his best chance to exert the influence and control of which he is capable?",
      "The indications are that United will continue with Amorim, and that’s to be expected for Sunk Cost FC. There is still a very fair argument that he deserves a summer to at least try and instil his ideas – and as importantly his players – in the squad.",
      "But the fact he so obviously needs a full summer only highlights what a complete pig’s anus United made of the whole thing in failing to act decisively last summer and then bringing in that kind of manager mid-season.",
      "And Amorim’s own decision to ignore his gut and make a mid-season move already looks like one of the worst judgement calls in recent times. Because there are no guarantees this yet represents rock-bottom for a broken football club.",
      "",
      "Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham)\nHas pulled off one of the great season-long pranks by doing what he said he would from the start and winning Tottenham a trophy in his second season.",
      "But the absolute and total sacrifice of Tottenham’s league form to facilitate that potentially transformative banter-ending win means that doubts about his long-term viability and suitability remain.",
      "We’ve changed our tune and declared that he deserves the chance to prove he’s learned the lessons of this season, that adaptability and pragmatism need not always be dirty words, and see if he can apply those knockout learnings to the more humdrum workaday business of the league.",
      "David Ornstein, though, is a man who knows his onions regarding these matters and he remains of the view that the Spurs board remain of a mind to follow through on their planned change of course this summer.",
      "That’s going to be a harder sell for Daniel Levy to a newly enchanted fanbase than it might have been.",
      "Whatever direction it takes, a genuinely fascinating summer awaits now at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium given the unexpected and vast opportunities that have just presented themselves.",
      "",
      "Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nFeels like more rests on Sunday’s final Premier League day than next Wednesday’s Europa Conference final, at least with regard to Maresca’s own future.",
      "Winning the Conference has long felt close to an inevitability for a Chelsea side absurdly overpowered compared to its opposition. In a year when the 16th and 17th best teams in England have been able to dominate the Europa League, Chelsea had absolutely no wriggle room in the third-tier competition.",
      "What matters surely for Maresca now is returning Chelsea to the Champions League. However slapdash and unfocused their spending may be, it is spending at a level that demands that platform. Really, it demands a title challenge of some kind.",
      "Even when Chelsea appeared capable of delivering such a challenge, Maresca insisted they couldn’t. It always felt vaguely self-interested and also perhaps slightly self-fulfilling. For a manager who came into the job to a chorus of doubts surrounding his total lack of top-flight managerial experience it didn’t exactly inspire confidence that he understood the assignment.",
      "A late pick-up in league form has slightly quietened the noise around Maresca’s future, but the fact remains that he is yet to ensure he even matches Mauricio Pochettino’s sixth-place effort from last season, and a stunning run of form to end the season couldn’t save the Argentinean 12 months ago.",
      "",
      "Scott Parker (Burnley)\nMuch of the arguments here apply equally as clearly if slightly more harshly to Daniel Farke who has delivered the Championship title for Leeds.",
      "The concern with both promoted managers is that we already knew they were very good Championship managers, but equally all the evidence we have points to them being rotten top-flight ones.",
      "Farke, though, having delivered better results in more striking fashion, dodges the final spot on this list in favour of Parker, whose often grim sufferball tactics to steer Burnley to promotion don’t suggest a thrilling bid for Premier League survival is in store.",
      "Just as teams who get promoted playing great free-flowing attacking football – like Burnley’s last promoted team under Vincent Kompany – find the step up unmanageable, we fear that a team that has gone so far the other way will be equally exposed by the step up.",
      "There has to be a middle ground, and we have little confidence Parker can find it at a level that has already proved beyond him before."

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has told Alejandro Garnacho to find a new club, while also informing the squad he will remain in charge next season, according to a report.",
      "This season, Garnacho has been one of United’s most used players, making 58 appearances across all competitions and featuring in 36 of the 37 Premier League games.",
      "Since joining the club’s academy from Atletico Madrid in October 2020, the winger has made 144 appearances, scoring 26 goals and providing 22 assists.",
      "Despite his extensive playing time, Garnacho looks set to leave the Red Devils this summer.",
      "Napoli made an approach for Garnacho in January, but United rejected the offer. Chelsea have also been linked with a move.",
      "Previous reports stated that United wanted at least €70million (£58.7m) for the 20-year-old, but that price tag is expected to drop this summer, with Chelsea still among the clubs interested.",
      "The situation gained fresh momentum after Manchester United’s Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "According to The Athletic correspondent David Ornstein, Amorim confirmed to his players that he will remain manager next season but told Garnacho ‘to find a new club’.",
      "Sources close to the club revealed that ‘Amorim players at the club’s Carrington training ground on Saturday to inform them of his own plans, and, in front of the group, of those for Garnacho’.",
      "Garnacho’s frustration with Amorim surfaced publicly after being limited to a 20-minute cameo in the Europa League final against Spurs.",
      "Following the match, Garnacho told reporters he would “see what happens” after the summer break.",
      "“It’s hard for everyone. The season was s***, both now losing the final tonight, and in the league, where we didn’t beat anyone, that’s the truth,” Garnacho said.",
      "“Up until the final, I’ve played every round, and today to play 20 minutes… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens after.”",
      "His brother Roberto also criticized Amorim on social media, accusing the manager of “thrown under the bus” by not starting him in Wednesday’s final.",
      "Garnacho’s relationship with Amorim has had ups and downs. He was dropped alongside Marcus Rashford for the Manchester derby in December but later regained some trust.",
      "The club reportedly considered selling him and fellow academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo in January to help comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Fabrizio Romano confirmed Garnacho is ‘expected to leave’ United during the summer window.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Alejandro Garnacho, expected to leave Man United in case of good proposal for both parties as reported on Thursday.",
      "‘United are open to selling certain players also to finance new signings; Garnacho is one of them. The winger attracted interest in January, race open again.’",
      "Meanwhile, Ben Jacobs added: ‘Alejandro Garnacho remains a possibility for #CFC (Chelsea), who also appreciate Jamie Gittens and Nico Williams.",
      "‘Napoli still keen, but also in talks for Georgi Sudakov, who is a similar profile. They bid €50m for Garnacho in January. Manchester United wanted €70m+ back then. Price expected to drop this summer.’",
      "Elsewhere, club captain Bruno Fernandes is also attracting interest, particularly from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",

      "He is under contract until 2028 and is valued at €50million (£41.9m) by Transfermarkt.",
      "It hasn’t been the most productive campaign for the 23-year-old, who has scored 10 goals and provided six assists in 27 Premier League appearances. Despite some promise, he has struggled to deliver consistent performances throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "There is strong interest in Pedro, and a Brighton exit looks increasingly likely – especially after he was reportedly involved in a training ground clash with Jan Paul van Hecke, which led to him being dropped from the squad for Monday’s win over Premier League champions Liverpool.",

      "“With Joao we had a small issue in training, the type which isn’t uncommon from time to time in all football clubs. We dealt with it internally and the matter is closed,” Hurzeler said.",
      "“Joao is an incredible football player, he’s a match-winner for us, he’s a great player and that’s why we invested in him.",

      "Man Utd’s financial situation is nowhere near as troublesome as penny-pinching Sir Jim Ratcliffe would like us to think, with a recent report from The Times claiming defeat to Spurs on Wednesday night would leave them with a summer budget of £100m, which would increase to £205m should Marcus Rashford (£40m), Antony (£40m) and Jadon Sancho (£25m) exit permanently following their respective loans this season.",

Instead, let’s work off the assumption that the Blues buy and immediately sell the major flop (and Rashford and Antony’s improved form seals their permanent exits) to ensure the Red Devils have a healthy enough budget to at least set up a climb to mid-table from the fringes of relegation.",
      "It is not realistic to expect United to upgrade every position (as is required) in a singular window, so we have focused on six priorities for the club to address this summer as a combined possible investment of £202.7m would afford Amorim (or his successor) a far stronger squad than the current dross…",

      "The No.10 role is a key position in this set-up. While Amad Diallo and Mason Mount, to varying degrees, have proved their ability to thrive there under Amorim, one or two reinforcements are required to add goals and quality depth, especially with unsuited Alejandro Garnacho surely sealing his exit with his post-match outburst on Wednesday night.",

      "Still, Cunha’s stance on a move to Old Trafford is a huge boost with the club crying out for any semblance of positivity, as his supreme displays for Wolves indicate that he should be a sure-fire success at Old Trafford. If he flops, everyone there should pack up and go home.",
      "The F365 Premier League XI of the Season inductee is too good to be playing for a side near the bottom (so that should rule out Man Utd *wink*) and a move to a Big Six club is long overdue, with the Brazil international a ready-made signing fit for Amorim’s system.

      "Joshua Zirkzee had a dire couple of months but showed real promise before picking up his thigh injury. He should be above exit-bound Hojlund in Amorim’s thinking, though there is an argument to suggest his Dimitar Berbatov-esque style makes him more suited to the head coach’s No.10 role rather than a standalone No.9.",

      "Ideally, they would sign a more proven striker (i.e. Viktor Gyokeres) to combine with Delap next season, but their inability to freely spend as other positions require attention means they will have to settle for the Englishman, who would still be an upgrade on current options.",

      "If reports are to be believed, Garcia is expected to join Arsenal to compete with David Raya next season, but he would be fighting a losing battle at the Emirates and would get much more game time at Man Utd.",
      "Garcia has sparkled in a poor Espanyol team, with his £25m release clause to fall to only £12.5m if they are relegated on the final day of the La Liga season. With his side two points clear of safety amid a five-game losing streak, that is entirely plausible.",

      "Here are ten reasons he should obviously be given the boot.",
      "",
      "Statistically the worst\nWe have to go back to 1927 and Herbert Hamlett to find a Manchester United manager with a worse win percentage than Amorim’s 36.59%. It’s the fourth worst in the club’s history. His Premier League win record of 24% is comfortably the worst of any United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign, with David Moyes’ 50% the second-worst.",
      "The 0.92 points-per-game Amorim has won this season after Erik ten Hag and Ruud van Nistelrooy got them to 15 from the first 11 games between them would have seen United claim just shy of 35 points across a 38-game season, which would have seen them relegated in 11 Premier League campaigns this century and is the worst record after 26 games of any manager of the traditional ‘big six’ clubs.",
      "",
      "Subjectively ‘the worst’\n“We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United.” Straight from the horse’s mouth. And while Amorim’s mastery of self-deprecation over the last few months is something to be admired – at least he knows they’re sh*t – that shouldn’t obscure our view or cause us to lose sight of the fact that they are really, really sh*t.",
      "There were widespread complaints across the fanbase over the football played under pretty much every manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, but there was always something to hang your hat on: Fight under Jose Mourinho; rigidity under Louis van Gaal; chaos under Ole Gunner Solskjaer. It was never good enough, but it was sometimes good, sometimes fine and sometimes bad. This is almost all bad.",
      "",
      "What is his philosophy?\nCan you tell us what Amorim’s philosophy is without referring to what he did at Sporting? After six months – six months – we don’t even know what Manchester United’s style is supposed to be. It’s 3-4-3, we sure as sh*t know that. But are Manchester United a possession-based team? What kind of pressing does he want? How high is their defensive line meant to be? Should the wide centre-backs be stepping into midfield? What’s the job of the inverted wingers?",
      "We don’t know and the players appear to have even less of an idea. Also, any chance of a novel set-piece? Y’know, some evidence of coaching. Cheers.",
      "",
      "Refusal to change\nWe wonder if Amorim has had even the slightest wobble over his dedication to stay true to what worked at Sporting through half a year of that not working in any way, shape or form at Old Trafford.",
      "The blame for this obsession with footballing principles is often aimed at Pep Guardiola, but the Manchester City side that won the Treble is a far cry from his Barcelona side and even his early winning teams at the Etihad. Mikel Arteta has tweaked and adapted in five seasons at Arsenal. And Arne Slot has proven the value in making not insignificant changes to Liverpool’s style and system, not just across the season but during games to walk to the Premier League title.",
      "Surely a manager who can play in multiple different ways, albeit with a few non-negotiables, is just unequivocally better than a manager who can’t. Even the most principled manager perhaps in the history of the Premier League ripped up his own rule book to get the better of Amorim and beat United to the Europa League title.",
      "",
      "Failure to coach players to fit the system\nWe understand the excuse of these United players not being good enough. They’re a damn sight better than 16th in the Premier League, but for a team that’s historically won and challenged for major titles, it’s a fair point. We also understand that many of them, seemingly most of them, do not suit Amorim’s system. They’ve got full-backs who aren’t wing-backs, wingers instead of inverted wingers, etc etc.",
      "What we neither understand nor accept is that the majority of them can’t be coached to suit the system. They may not be their ideal positions, but surely they can be coached to improve in roles that exist in Amorim’s XI rather than being cast out before thriving away from Manchester United, as Antony and Marcus Rashford have done this season.",
      "We’re surprised Roy Keane hasn’t told Amorim ‘it’s his job’ yet.",
      "",
      "Money required to buy players to fit the system\nPut yourself in Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s shoes for a moment (horrible, right?) and imagine what it must be like to be told by your manager, whom you’ve hired through no little expense, that 90 per cent of the players you pay the wages of aren’t suited to his system and so aren’t in his plans moving forward.",
      "What in your mind would be the path of least resistance? Sign five or six players this summer and another five or six next summer for £400m or whatever that would cost, or sack the manager and get someone in who could put these players to better use?",
      "Amorim has admitted that he’s asking for “faith” he’s neither earned nor deserves and having spent £200m on Erik ten Hag’s players last summer after their worst-ever Premier League season before sacking him a couple of months later – which Ratcliffe himself acknowledges was a mistake – it would be the definition of insanity to do exactly the same thing again.",
      "",
      "He’s a loser\nOk, it’s not exactly the same thing because Ten Hag won a trophy at the end of his miserable campaign while Amorim lost the Europa League final at the end of his even more miserable campaign.",
      "We thoroughly enjoyed the Class of ’92 pundits insisting Manchester United would win on Wednesday having lost three times already to Tottenham this season through ‘logic’ amounting to nothing more than their typical This Is Manchester United b*llocks.",
      "Presumably they and the rest of us can now finally accept that This Is Not Manchester United after they lost an actual final to actual Spurs and make judgements on a team’s chances of winning something based on how good they are at football rather than through rubbing crystal skulls and tracking the position of the moon in the week leading up to it.",
      "And for that, Mr Amorim, we thank you.",
      "",
      "Available managers\nWe’re not about to suggest that anyone could replace Amorim and mount anything close to a title challenge, but there will definitely be a few we would back to make a decent fist of what currently looks like the club’s impossible target Ratcliffe has set of sixth in the Premier League next season.",
      "We would love to see Simone Inzaghi at Old Trafford and believe his and Inter’s policy of signing experienced players with something to prove would be an excellent method of righting the United ship. But that’s not going to happen, because a) why would he leave Inter for United? and b) United aren’t about to pay the compensation.",
      "There are several very capable available managers though: Xavi, Marco Rose, Max Allegri, Edin Terzic. The question will be whether they could attract any of them like a moth to the flames of their dumpster fire. They could always reignite their interest in Gary O’Neil.",
      "",
      "‘Untouchables’ to get-the-f***-out-of-our-club-ables\nYou might have seen the scarves – the ones with the faces of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo on them along with some sort of tagline hailing them as the future of Manchester United. They were The Untouchables ahead of the 2024 summer transfer window – the only players they would not listen to offers for.",
      "The fact that Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot have had the same moniker bestowed upon them at points in the meantime shows just how insecure that sacrosanct status can be, but we never would have guessed a year ago that by the start of the 2025-26 season not one of Hojlund, Garnacho or Mainoo would still be at the club and that’s a very real possibility.",
      "And it’s not because of PSR. Garnacho and Mainoo would both be ‘pure profit’ sales, but they would have been last summer too, and there’s absolutely no chance United would let them go if Amorim wanted to keep them given the extraordinary lack of players in his squad he has any faith in whatsoever.",
      "They’ve both got flaws, sure, but United used to be a place where flawed players became infallible, where immaturity would make way for professionalism and dominance. If United’s goal is to sign players whose value can increase through their time at the club then they’ve got to have a manager willing and able to nurture them through that process.",
      "",
      "No compensation\nHe’s f***ing asking for it, mate. No “conversation about compensation”? That’s a red or white flag depending how you look at it. Put him out of his misery and bring the next poor b*stard in.",
      "One fan reckons Man Utd are in ‘absolutely really big trouble’ financially, as another calls on the Red Devils to sign 12 players…",
      "Neville reveals the “noise I’m hearing” over Amorim’s summer transfer budget as two reported sales prove “there’s something fundamentally wrong” at Man Utd.",
      "Neville has urged Amorim to “wipe out” one Man Utd and to “stop doing the honourable thing” after defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "It will be far cheaper to sack Ruben Amorim than keep him at Manchester United and Arne Slot has ‘chucked one of his own under the bus’.",
      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",

      "“Nothing is sorted, nothing is done or completed or even very, very, very close, so that process will take its course.”",
      "McKenna added: “We will be proud of the part that we have had in terms of Liam’s development and his contribution this season.",
      "“If he stays with us, we will be delighted, and if he moves on this summer, it will be a positive sign for the club to have developed and sold a player at that sort of level and hopefully it will be a good move for him as well.”",
      "Chelsea are believed to be very interested in signing Delap this summer, but they also have Arsenal-linked RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko on their radar.",

      "Amorim is among the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked as he’s endured a horrible six months at Old Trafford.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon boss was headhunted by INEOS following their decision to sack Erik ten Hag and he decided to join Man Utd mid-season, despite initially being against this idea.",
      "Amorim should be regretting this decision as he’s swapped a title race in Portugal to a basket case in Manchester as his dismal squad has failed to get accustomed to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Performances and results under Amorim have been worse than they were under Ten Hag as Man Utd are at risk of finishing 17th in the Premier League. They have also come up short in the Europa League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup, so they won’t play in Europe next season.",
      "It would be harsh to sack Amorim before he’s had the opportunity to build a more-suited squad, but former Man Utd assistant Rene Meulensteen reckons he’ll be gone after ten games next season on one condition.",
      "“He has to win eight out of 10 or 90% of the games at the start of the season, that’s how long ten Hag was given (sacked after nine league and one EFL cup games on October 28th),” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",

      "“People want to know how you can get out of this mess rather than reinforcing how bad it is, but I don’t hear that. He’s questioning too many things, and he’s questioning himself, and that is never a good thing.",
      "“Amorim should have done better because he’s had plenty of time now working with the players, and you question the disconnect when you constantly see these poor performances. Do they lack quality? Are the messages not getting across to the players? Or is it the rigid system?”",
      "Meulensteen has also argued that the “writing is on the wall” for Amorim, who has made one huge “mistake”.",
      "“The writing has been on the wall for quite some time. You could see there was a negative line in terms of performances and results under ten Hag. Eventually, when that line was persistently going down, they got rid of ten Hag to bring Amorim in,” Muelensteen added.",
      "“If you look through all the stats, all the numbers, and all the performances, that line continues to decline. Apart from in the Europa League, which was a different competition, and even then, it required luck in the miracle game against Lyon. They could have easily been knocked out, and you would have looked at a far more dour season.",
      "“Amorim made a mistake in the beginning by saying ‘I want to play the 3-4-3 system, and I’m not going to change’, so he started putting round pegs in square holes.",
      "“He could have done himself favours by saying, ‘I’m in favour of playing a 3-4-3, I’ve had a lot of success with it. However, I don’t know yet if that will work for Manchester United yet I need to get to know the players, I need to get to know the league’.",

      "Spurs and the Europa\nI am a 50 year old, Australian born, lifelong Spurs supporter. When I say lifelong, I mean it. I’m named for Martin Chivers, Steve Perryman and Pat Jennings. My dad was a season ticket holder before my parents moved here in the 70s. One of my most prized possessions is a congratulatory card to my parents after my birth, signed by the first team at the time.",
      "I remember being woken at midnight to watch the 81 and 82 FA Cup finals and talking to my dad after the 1991 final, his last.",
      "When I finally moved to England for a few years in 2001, the first thing I did was get a ticket to White Hart Lane (3-0 vs Coventry). I was at the Lane to see us beaten 3-0 by Chelsea, took my now wife to see the godawful loss to Sam Allardyce’s Bolton just after Bill Nick died. I was even there for the league cup collapse to 10 man Manchester City.",
      "This is all why Wednesday night/Thursday morning meant so much, even from so far away. It’s the first trophy of my 15 year old son’s life (by his age, we had 3, including the 84 UEFA cup) and watching it with him made me think about my own father and how much he’d have loved to see it.",
      "Luckily for my son, as I grew up on the Central Coast I made the Mariners my A-League team and he’s seen 3 grand final wins (including last year when we made it there) and another grand final win for the women’s team last Sunday (yes – some of us do watch women’s football).",
      "The Europa league final was awful. The league form, even before putting all of the eggs in the EL basket, inexcusable.",
      "I don’t care. I don’t much like Ange, but he’s right. This was for the true believers. I’m raising a glass and toasting this team and all of the Spurs supporters who share the joy with me.",

      "Wow.. what a few days.",
      "As a Spurs fan, even at the best of times, you know you’re gonna get punched in the mouth every now and again. This season, it felt like being a few rounds deep with Muhammad Ali most weeks.",
      "Despite it all, for Ange Postecoglou and that group of players to persist and persevere, and push through all the negativity, the crises of confidence, the injuries, the noise, and to come out the other side holding their first trophy in nearly 20 years is inspiring.",
      "I only got to catch up on F365 mailboxes today, so I got a nice little chuckle at all the panicked rationalizing from other fans: It’s only the Europa League, two terrible teams, worst final ever, Don’t deserve Champions League, tallest dwarf, etc. Seeing opposition fans horrified that they can no longer ‘banter’ Spurs over being trophyless, and scrambling to find new sticks to beat Spurs it is delightful. You keep doing whatever you need to do guys, we’ll just keep watching the clips of Sonny lifting the cup on repeat. (Although credit to David Tickner, who I’ve criticised for his anti-Spurs takes before, for his magnanimous article celebrating Spurs and Ange!)",
      "But really I wanted to write in about Ange – and to say to Ange I’m sorry I ever doubted.",
      "I was a huge Ange advocate since the beginning. He wasn’t a mercenary like Jose or Conte, temporarily gracing lowly Spurs with his presence. He was a man with passion and a vision. He was going to make Spurs winners again. He was going to rebuild the culture at the club. He was going to make fans and players believe. And he was going to do it playing exciting, attacking football.",
      "The attacking, exciting football part has been a bit of a problem. It’s glorious when it’s good, but when it’s been bad, it’s been awful. Dizzyingly high defensive lines, gaps in positions, and a dreadful injury crisis meant we were cannon fodder for teams who could sit back and wait to counterattack on us. 20+ league defeats later, and even I, a big Ange-truther, was beginning to say this project had run its course.",
      "He was ridiculed in the press. He’s been hounded out of his job in every interview. F365 among others have kept a regularly refreshed list of his potential successors live on the site since October. When we were dumped out of the league cup and FA cup, journalists were quick to smugly ask him if he was still going to win something in his second season.",
      "And he did.",
      "For him to take all that flack for himself, to bear all the brunt of the criticism, so that the players could focus on the job to be done is incredible. He’s led them to success for the first time in 20 years. Something Conte, Pochettino, Mourinho, Redknapp never did. He always wins things in his second season, mate.",
      "But what now? I’m conflicted.",
      "The league form was truly awful, and while it might be absolved, given the Europa success, it could never be acceptable again. My head says maybe the best thing is for Ange to leave now as a hero, who brought this team back to the winners circle, and calls it a promise kept. Spurs move on, and bring in a Thomas Frank or someone to hopefully build on this momentum, but take us in a slightly new, more pragmatic direction. Fresh start.",
      "But I think the heart says different. Ange says his work is not yet done. And the players seem to agree. Despite everything, the likes of Van de Ven, Maddison, Kulusevski, Bissouma, Vicario and others have come to bat for Ange – “We want to win this for him”. For him to keep the belief of a dressing room after a season like that is incredible. After an achievement like Wednesday, that bond will be even stronger. If I thought Ange could adapt his style, and adopt elements of the pragmatic style that won him his last few European fixtures, and if the chairman could support him in the transfer market, then I think the option that would make me happiest is to see us press ahead with Big Ange!",
      "Either way, huge congrats to Ange – Spurs fans will never forget the success he’s brought. I’ll always be wishing for his success, in our dugout, or another.\nAndy, Spurs, Eire",
      "",
      "Ange stays and Ruben goes\nThanks to a flight delay, I got to watch the first 30 minutes of the Europa League final, but had to shut down before the goal. I wasn’t terribly disappointed to turn it off, because it was awful. When I landed, I learned the result and saw the goal credited to Brennan Johnson, but my son had commented in the EPL Discord group we share with my friends and their friends that it was a Shaw OG. That’s just funnier, and I would prefer to believe it.",
      "With many apologies to Tottenham supporters — you’ve my sincere congratulations on your Europa League win, and I’m quite jelly, because it beats our pot sideways — I generally appreciate F365’s evident editorial pleasure in regarding Spurs as Spursy and openly endorsing in advance the funniest possible Europa League Final narrative vis-à-vis Spurs. I hope you’ll understand: it’s an objectively funny narrative precisely because it’s silly.",
      "So, Spurs haven’t won a trophy in 17 years? Cry me a river. That’s far more success than Newcastle United or Crystal Palace could boast in 2024, so it’s hard to feel very bad about having that particular laugh. Especially when it’s more or less true; Spurs’ league form has been shocking.",
      "But I agree with Tickner and several Mailbox contributors that the cup win changes things for Ange Postecoglou. Unless you want to consider the possibility that he’s the Kwisatz Haderach, you have to treat his prophecy as merely a demonstrable trend. This is the fifth consecutive job in which he’s won a trophy in his second season, and trophies aren’t available every year for an international coach. I’ve little doubt he left the Australia job precisely because he knew he couldn’t win them a World Cup, asked himself what succeeding would look like, and didn’t like the answer.",
      "Big Ange may just be what he appears to be at this moment: a remarkably adaptable coach for whom short-term success is very likely, but is only now beginning his first attempt at sustained success at the highest level. I’m not aware of how much input he has in transfers, but I’d call most of the bigger outlays attributed to him moderately successful; extremely successful, if the goal Levy set was a trophy in year two.",
      "Spurs supporters may have a different perspective, but I have a lifetime of experience with volatile team owners in the US, and it’s hard for me to imagine Daniel Levy firing Ange right now. It would alienate many (though I suspect not all) supporters, and trophies are what an owner looks for in a coach or manager. Prize money, and the guarantee of more prize money next year.",
      "And if Levy does push the eject button, Ange will likely have a wealth of opportunities and a very happy agent. He’s in the catbird seat right now, as we inexplicably say in the Southeastern US.",
      "Also: given our cup history over my lifetime, I can almost never find it in myself to be disappointed with a Manchester United loss. The stats seem to suggest they should have won, and Amorim is accused of mismanagement in 16 Conclusions. Indeed, one wonders if a Jim Ratcliffe-influenced board might just snatch at his offer to decline compensation if sacked.",
      "A financial path forward for ManU is tough to chart. Among the academy graduates, Mainoo seems to be the most saleable asset, and his value is debatable at the moment and is most likely greatest as a homegrown member of the squad. Abandoning the 343 (or however you want to characterize Amorim’s system) and hiring a manager to make better use of the talent already present — Mason Mount might qualify, for example — while the rebuild proceeds in a more natural direction might be a good idea.",
      "What Manchester United needs is flexibility, and Amorim may not be able to provide that on the available transfer budget. Or willing to provide it at all. On the other hand, they won’t have the bother of Europe next season.\nChris C, Toon Army DC (Ambivalent over the playoff final. LALAS or derbies? Both are wonderful.)",
      "",
      "Over the United fatalism\nWhat did we learn out of the Europa League final that we didn’t already know? Honest question…",
      "A United team which has been poor for six-odd months was poor again and lost. The overall depth and quality of a team which is shoddy in defence, lacks bite and control in midfield, and has next-to-no goals in it was, you guessed it, shoddy in defence, lacked bite and control in midfield and drew a blank.",
      "Spurs, to their credit, were able to be slightly less poor on the night and unconvincingly accounted for the worst United side in 50 years.",
      "Well done.",
      "But can we put a pin in the Manchester United fatalism? No United fan is happy with where the Club sits, how it’s being managed and how it’s performing – but maybe, just maybe, this is the opportunity to properly, actually reset the Club has needed for years.",
      "No papering over the cracks, no playing dress-ups at the big table of European football, no fixtures and competitions we’re nowhere near good enough to properly compete in for now…",
      "This is the chance to start a build we should’ve undertaken post-Jose. A proper, top-to-bottom rebuild. The open-heart surgery Rangnick diagnosed.",
      "Easier said than done, sure, and a far from linear process… but a chance to move beyond the quick fix, short term vanity signings which have plagued us for years and look for players who a/ fit a profile and method of play and b/ are not signing to pump up their pensions.",
      "And before anyone starts, if rival fans seriously think there’s no allure to signing for and becoming a Manchester United star, you’re kidding yourself. So let’s find the players for whom that means something.",
      "Come in, be a part of something from the ground up and be a reason this Club turns things around. It’s Manchester United – something which has always meant something and still does, no matter how loudly opposition fans protest it doesn’t.",
      "And on the fatalism… worst case for Manchester United is results get so dire the Glazers sell up and f**k off. Which would be a magnificent result – maybe the single worst result for the Club’s rivals, to be honest.",
      "It’s pretty easy to support your team when the going is good. For all the disappointments in recent times they’ve given me plenty to cheer about across the journey… I now hope they can begin the slow march back towards contention at home and abroad.\nSean Peter-Budge, Melbourne, Australia",
      "",
      "Suck it up\nGet a grip.",
      "This is my message to my fellow Man Utd fans.",
      "We are in the ‘find out’ phase of a decade and a half of chronic incompetence; mistakes compounded by mistakes; a relentless pursuit of a sunken cost fallacy brought on by our arrogance, impatience and an overbearing weight of expectation.",
      "We have chopped and changed managers and gameplans every 3yrs never allowing for any true synergy between manager and squad. We have signed players based on reputation and commercial viability with leveraged transfer fees that we still owe around £300m on. We have doled out massive, long term contracts to panic buys & ‘marquee’ signings which has had the knock on effect of massively inflating wages throughout the squad. Basically, think of any clichéd football mistake and we have made it repeatedly. Of course we’re shite!",
      "Our situation right now has been inevitable for a long time. What we need to do now is shut up, take our medicine and be patient. If you need somewhere to focus your frustration and anger about it all, the Glazers should be the target. INEOS haven’t been perfect (SJR’s petty cuts towards the ordinary folk at the club are pointless besides demonstrating that he is a monumental tw*t) but they have been sound so far with transfers; Yoro, Dorgu, Ugarte, Zirkzee and Heaven have all looked good so far.",
      "The last thing we need to do is sack Amorim. We need a period of continuity where we have a plan and we stick to it. There are too many mitigating factors to confidently say that he is the problem.",
      "343 looks like the incoming paradigm so remoulding our squad to fit it is a sound, forward thinking plan even if we do eventually move on from Amorim.",
      "Amorim being pragmatic and adapting to the players we have would just be repeating Erik Ten Hag’s mistake. Form would improve then inevitably tank as he tries to transition to his style. He’d get sacked anyway, the next manager would inherit another Frankenstein squad and we’ll be back to square one. Better to just push ahead with his ideas and get the most painful phase out the way first. We will improve when he has more suitable players.",
      "Being out of Europe gives us an opportunity to cull the squad this summer. If we set our target for next season to a top 10 finish, we can be more bold with game time for academy players and aim lower (with a much broader pool) for signings with an emphasis on suitability for the system.",
      "We are in a reset phase where our expectations need to be adjusted to give us time & space to lay new foundations.",
      "There is reason for optimism but stop expecting it all to happen immediately. The boat has sailed on any hope of a quick fix. We now need to be methodical and precise.",
      "And for those of us who grew up in the glory days, now is the time to prove for once and for all that we are not glory hunters.\nTom, Tooting",
      "",
      "Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes\nI read recently to my dismay and bitter disappointment that Amorim said he did not intend to change anything. If this is true, it would the most irresponsible and uncaring statement a Head Coach can make.",
      "Under Amorim’s reign, Man United have set and broken all sorts of unwanted, undesired and humiliating records.  Most United fans are hurting and, for the Head Coach to say he would not change anything, is more than an insult.",
      "Results and performances don’t lie. Clearly, his system, tactics, mass rotation, team selection and substitutions have, by and large, failed. In my profession, as it is in all other professions and areas of human endeavour, if the situation is retrogressing, changes are identified and made. I don’t belong to the school of thought which advocates the unnecessary sacking of coaches but, if Amorim’s publicly professed contention is not to make changes, then he must leave. No changes would lead to more pain next season and that is not acceptable.",
      "I urge all United fans and everyone who has interest in our beloved club to impress upon Amorim to make effective changes. Changes constitute a ‘sini qua non’ for success.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",
      "",
      "Compare and contrast\nGood morning",
      "Please compare Liverpool and ManU’s deroute and ways of tackling them during their respective transitions. What errors have the two clubs made? What good things have they done? Why was the transition in Liverpool ultimately a success, while it doesn’t look too good for ManU? Where have ManU repeated the errors made by LFC? And why haven’t they learned anything from history?",
      "And probably many more questions.",
      "Thanks",
      "Kind regards\nMichael from Denmark  – LFC-fan,  but curious about the similarities between the two mastodons and their situations (both Hicks/Gilette and the Glazers are nincompoops!)."

      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",

      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing Erik ten Hag at the end of 2024, losing 16 of his 41 matches in all competitions.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon initially wanted to join Man Utd at the end of this season, but INEOS pushed for him to arrive immediately and this has backfired.",
      "The 40-year-old has attempted to implement a new system in the middle of the season and has unsurprisingly found this incredibly difficult with Man Utd’s squad unsuited to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Without ready-made wing-backs or suitable No.10s, Man Utd’s system has been ineffective for months as they have been toothless in attack.",
      "READ: Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "Man Utd could still finish 17th in the Premier League this season and they were dealt a severe blow on Wednesday night, losing 1-0 to Spurs in the Europa League final to miss out on a trophy and Champions League football.",
      "Carragher thinks Man Utd chiefs need to start asking whether they ‘appointed the wrong manager at the wrong time’.",
      "‘At some point during their post-season review of a dire campaign, someone in the Manchester United boardroom will need the courage to ask the toughest question: “Did we appoint the wrong manager at the wrong time?”’ Carragher wrote for The Telegraph.",
      "‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe may still believe Ruben Amorim is one of the best young coaches of his generation. He may think that, had Amorim not joined United last November, he would have been hired by another top European club and excelled.",
      "‘He may also be sure that if United had the same funds to rebuild the team as Amorim’s predecessors had at their disposal, it would be a question of when, not if, United return to the top of the English and European game.",
      "‘But in the aftermath of a dismal Europa League final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, the dilemma around Amorim is more complicated than for any of those who have tried and failed at Old Trafford since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.’",
      "Carragher has also floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Amorim and Man Utd amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "‘Now that his six months in charge have gone so badly, Ratcliffe and his Ineos colleagues will need a decisive plan for how he will navigate the club through the most challenging period in United’s modern history,’ Carragher continued.",
      "‘Their grave concern must be that they have seen absolutely no evidence so far to suggest he is up to it. On that basis, backing Amorim this summer may be the honourable option, but it is not necessarily the bravest.",
      "‘Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.’",
      "He added: ‘The much-anticipated tactical innovations, and development of younger players, have been non-existent.",
      "‘The only successful game-changing strategy Amorim has offered is throwing Harry Maguire up front for the final few minutes of European games.’",
      "One fan reckons Man Utd are in ‘absolutely really big trouble’ financially, as another calls on the Red Devils to sign 12 players…",
      "Jamie Carragher: “I used to be embarrassed to go out of the house when I played for Liverpool and we were seventh. They’re 16th! It’s unbelievable!”",

      "Neville has urged Amorim to “wipe out” one Man Utd and to “stop doing the honourable thing” after defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "It will be far cheaper to sack Ruben Amorim than keep him at Manchester United and Arne Slot has ‘chucked one of his own under the bus’.",
      "A Man Utd manager would be sacked 99 times out of 100 based on what Amorim’s done this season. Here’s ten reasons why Ratcliffe should give him the boot."

      "Not quite. He just said, “I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute he was on training ground. In my opinion there were certain moments he could do more, to put it mildly. I told him he’s a much better defender than people think, but you don’t show it all the time.”",
      "Which is a) hardly a particularly controversial thing for a new manager to say to a player, and most importantly b) not the full quote, despite that being all the MailOnline offers.",

      "“Maybe he said it himself, he’s going to leave either way so why not tell. Maybe it’s already a first gift I can give Xabi Alonso. But I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute how he was on the training ground. In my opinion in certain moments he could do a bit more, to say it mildly, and that’s what we talked about.",
      "“Combined with that I said to him: ‘You are a much better defender than everybody tells you, unfortunately you don’t show it all the time, that’s why people sometimes say you are not’.",
      "“If he is just at it and focused and concentrated, there are not many players that can go around him, because he’s fast, he’s agile, he has great mentality.",
      "“But it’s about showing that every single game, because in this world we are judged not only on the 34 games we do well, we are mainly judged on the four games we don’t do so well.",
      "“These things we spoke about in pre-season.”",
      "Again, it sounds a hell of a lot like an incoming coach having some pretty standard, constructive observations about one of his new players. And the best bit is that Slot’s answer was prefaced with this line, which changes everything completely:",
      "“I think Mo has said already a few things about why he was in my office in pre-season and there were similar reasons why Trent was in my office in the beginning of the season!”",
      "So this was in pre-season and Slot had similar conversations with Salah, who recently explained: “He showed me a few videos of myself in the warm-up. I was like quite slow, didn’t do much. Then he showed me, ‘look at the second [player] after he sees you take it easy, look at the third one’. Then you see the whole line walking like me and he said, ‘that’s your influence on the team’.”",
      "Did Slot ‘turn on’ Salah and ‘fire criticism’ at him at the time? Or does it only count when the player in question is in the middle of a controversial departure?",

      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors.",
      "“And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",

      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season.

      "Gary Neville says Ruben Amorim must end the \"negativity spiral\" at Manchester United and \"get a grip\" of the club after a nightmare season.",
      "After that defeat, United defender Luke Shaw said: \"All of us have to question ourselves. Are we good enough to be here? Because for this club, this season it's not acceptable. We know that and it's down to us.\"",
      "Neville believes those comments are an alarming reflection of how the players are feeling and Amorim must swiftly move to correct the culture in the club and dressing room if he is to achieve a significant improvement next season.",
      "\"I want to point towards Luke Shaw's interview, where he talked about, 'we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and decide whether we're good enough to play for Manchester United',\" said Neville on The Overlap show It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"Luke, it's not your job to determine that. A player at Manchester United should have no control as to whether they're there or not. The manager of the football club decides whether you're good enough to play in that football team.",
      "\"When the players are starting to come out and question publicly whether they're good enough to play for the club, you know how bad it is internally there. You imagine what they're saying to each other inside.",
      "\"I have this thing about negativity spiral in my businesses, in my life. If I hear the energy-sapping negativity spiral starting to move, whereby you can feel people starting to have an influence over the others, and Luke's an experienced player now, honestly, I think you've got to wipe it out. You've got to wipe out every single player in that dressing room who doesn't believe that they've got total and utter confidence to play for that football club.",
      "\"There were some players on that pitch and some players on the bench who I think can still do a good job for Manchester United. I don't believe it's a case of get rid of them all. I think there's some talent in there. I believe that. And this idea that they don't care, I'll repeat what I've said many, many times again, never, ever think that of football players.",
      "\"Do they want to lose football matches? Do they want to be criticised on social media? The answer is no. They do care. They've worked thousands of hours to get to this position of playing for the club, but the club is eating them alive. The club is eating them alive, it's too big for them.\"",
      "Neville called on Amorim to take swift action this summer, comparing the situation to how Mikel Arteta has played a big role in the overhaul at Arsenal in recent years.",
      "\"Someone's got to get a grip of that club, and I think it has to be the manager. Ruben, you've got to get a grip of that club,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Mikel Arteta's done a great job at Arsenal. From day one, he imprinted his standards on the club, he put the coaching systems in place, there's been progression all the way through, and he's got five years now under his belt, six years under his belt.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim needs to look at next season, how he gets into the top six, how he basically wipes half that squad out, how he transforms it into a dynamic team that plays exciting football from the rigid stuff that we're currently watching, and he needs to think about which players in that dressing room can do a job for him.",
      "\"Because if the players are starting to question their own belonging in that dressing room, you've got a huge problem.\""

      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",

      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Scott McTominay played a crucial role in Napoli's Serie A-winning season, scoring 12 goals from midfield; Antonio Conte has got the best out of the Scot, with his numbers better than any season at Old Trafford; McTominay is one of a number of ex-Man Utd players faring better elsewhere",
      "Saturday 24 May 2025 13:39, UK",
      "It had to be him. On the crucial final day of the season, Scott McTominay got Napoli's Serie A title parade going with the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Cagliari. It has been the story of his and the club's campaign.",
      "Earlier this season, the Scot was asked about what his favourite nickname among the Napoli fanbase is. He was given a selection - and two stood out.",
      "One was 'McFratm'. It's the Neapolitan word for 'brother' - the Napoli faithful now revere the 28-year-old as one of the family.",
      "The other nickname: 'apribottiglie'. It means bottle opener - handed to him due to the sheer number of times he has given Napoli the lead. He gets the party started. He did exactly that when his team needed it most in the 2-0 win against Cagliari on Friday night, when his team required one win to claim the title.",
      "Nicknames are a big deal at the Naples club. Before his departure to Paris Saint-Germain in January, Kvicha Kvaratskhelia's talents were so unique he earned the term 'Kvaradona'. It's some honour given Diego Maradona's status literally hangs over the club.",
      "But now McTominay is the one with hero status.",
      "And for good reason. Despite Kvaratskhelia's departure, the arrivals of Antonio Conte and Romelu Lukaku to the club over the past year, the Scottish midfielder is the main reason why Napoli have their hands on another Scudetto title.",
      "His 18 goal contributions is the most from a midfielder in a Serie A debut season. It’s three more than Kaka during his first term at AC Milan.",
      "And in Napoli's run-in, McTominay was the bottle opener, starting the scoring in three consecutive league games in April against Empoli, Monza and Torino.",
      "He has been crucial in picking up points during decisive matches all season, scoring in the first game against title rivals Inter - yes, that was an opener too.",
      "And even though Napoli limped over the line for the title during the back end of the season, McTominay more than played his part. He basically carried them through. For example, in the 2-2 draw with Genoa a fortnight ago, he set up both goals - again, to put them ahead.",
      "McTominay has been vital in this title-winning team, which some Manchester United fans may struggle to believe. Reliable and consistent? Yes. But two goals behind top scorer Lukaku?",
      "Not everyone is stunned by this. \"How you can sell Scott is beyond me,\" former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said this season. McTominay also scored seven Premier League goals last season and was a penalty area threat under Erik ten Hag.",
      "But his 12 goals this season is one of many key metrics that have gone up since leaving Manchester United.",
      "One of them is minutes. McTominay has been trusted more by Napoli this term than in any season at Old Trafford - and even more so compared to Erik ten Hag's two full seasons at United.",
      "But there has been a position tweak too. At Napoli, McTominay has been handed a more attacking role, similar to his status as a No 10 for Scotland. In the 0-0 draw against Parma last week, he was even handed a role on the left wing - which of course used to be Kvaratskhelia's position.",
      "As a result, McTominay has been even more of an attacking presence. He has created twice as many chances in the league compared to last season at Manchester United.",
      "He takes players on five times as much as last term, while his pressing numbers have multiplied by more than four.",
      "Where was this at Old Trafford? Firstly, there is the feeling that McTominay was misunderstood as a player. The Scot was often used as a deeper midfield option at Old Trafford - sometimes even the deepest.",
      "A period playing as a centre-back for the Scotland national team didn't help United's cause - but how they failed to spot his potential higher up when Steve Clarke pushed him further up to being a regular goal threat.",
      "Of course, Bruno Fernandes was United's standout No 10 in McTominay's prominent years at United. But it only adds to the frustration of letting a talent like McTominay's go. He was not just misunderstood - but also overlooked.",
      "He is not the only United player currently revelling in success elsewhere while Ruben Amorim's side languish in crisis mode. McTominay has a Scudetto title to his name, Antony will take part in next week's Conference League final - which Jadon Sancho could be involved in as well.",
      "Dean Henderson has a FA Cup trophy to his name with Crystal Palace, while Anthony Elanga has justified his move to Nottingham Forest. Marcus Rashford looks better off and sharper at Aston Villa, with Tyrell Malacia a recently-crowned Dutch champion at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "None of the above will hurt more than McTominay though. This was a United academy product - and remember this club has had one of those in every matchday squad since 1937 - winning a major trophy elsewhere, after bidding an emotional goodbye to the club nearly a year ago.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho's futures also up in the air this summer, it will hit home as to whether United is an appropriate development ground for those that come through."

      "Fresh from a 10/1 winner in midweek, our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his Premier League insight across the final round of matches.",
      "Chelsea are the vulnerable ones in the final day race for the Champions League.",
      "Based on their soft underbelly away from home, winning just one of their last 10 Premier League games, this is a great spot for Nottingham Forest.",
      "A criticism of Enzo Maresca this season has been the predictability of Chelsea's play and that is more apparent when you remove Nicholas Jackson from the equation as he does bring a bit of surprise and directness to what Chelsea are trying to serve up. Forest's defensive duo of Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo will fancy their chances of another shutout.",
      "Forest to win to nil is 5/1 with Sky Bet and it's a bet that's landed in seven of their last 15 Premier League home games against the likes of Man City, Man Utd, Spurs, Crystal Palace and Brighton. It's worth a nibble.",
      "But the best bet lies in the shots market.",
      "If you exclude the relegated clubs, only Brentford and West Ham concede more home shots than Nottingham Forest. Marc Cucurella has been one of Chelsea's most consistent operators all season and he comes into this having a shot in 22 of his last 31 appearances, averaging 0.90 shots per-90 across the whole season.",
      "In a game Chelsea need to win, he'll be to the fore of their attacking process and is 10/11 with Sky Bet to have at least one shot.",
      "Over the past 10 seasons, the final day of the Premier League season has averaged 3.41 goals per game - 87 per cent of those matches have featured over 1.5 goals and 65 per cent have delivered over 2.5 goals. Over those 10 years, the average goal on the final matchday increases 0.6 per match from the overall average total goal count per match. That's a big spike.",
      "Teams are more likely to play with a bit more freedom in a no-pressure environment. It's attack-minded football to the fore. And this game just screams a mad scoreline.",
      "Final-day games have the tendency to go into overdrive in terms of a scoreline. Remember Crystal Palace 5-3 Bournemouth in 2019? Or Tottenham 5-4 Leicester in 2018? How about Hull City 1-7 Tottenham in 2017? And there was relegated Southampton drawing 4-4 Liverpool last season.",
      "On the final day it can pay to play the big lines, so over 5.5 goals at 7/2 with Sky Bet is certainly a runner.",
      "Villa are finishing the season like title contenders and this is a fixture sent from heaven for them. You couldn't hand-pick a more welcoming host.",
      "Unai Emery has got Villa so well-drilled. They've won seven of their last eight Premier League games with their only defeat being a last-minute goal at Manchester City. The underlying process has been the best in the entire division over that stretch, especially in defence where their 0.85 expected goals against per 90 is unmatched.",
      "Manchester United are guaranteed their lowest finish since promotion to the top-flight in 1975 and the home fans will be preparing the tomatoes for the lap of honour at the end of the final game.",
      "Villa to win to nil at 9/4 with Sky Bet has a great chance.",
      "Only once in Premier League history has a team entered the final day in a Champions League place and failed to qualify.",
      "Newcastle will be there with a win. A point will be enough if Forest vs Chelsea ends in a draw or Villa fail to win.",
      "Eddie Howe's team are a reliable bunch at home, winning their last six at St James' Park, scoring 20 goals.",
      "If they win this, it will be their most points (41) and most wins (13) at home in a Premier League campaign since 2003. It's hard to see anything but the 1/3 with Sky Bet landing - but how do we get a palatable price? The goalscorer market looks the place to be with Sandro Tonali the standout at 11/2 to score anytime. He has scored three in his last five home games as the Toon faithful do seem to inspire him.",
      "After the season Manchester City have had, is trusting them at 4/7 with Sky Bet to win away from home really a wise decision?",
      "City have won just one away game against teams currently in the top 12, which was a 2-0 win at Chelsea. And Fulham have an impressive home record this season against teams currently in the top nine, winning five of their eight games.",
      "This is officially their best Premier League season so the market is disrespecting them slightly with 4/1 with Sky Bet on offer for the home win.",
      "I'm going to meet in the middle and back the draw at 16/5 with Sky Bet as a point will be enough for City in their Champions League qualification pursuit due to their superior goal difference over Villa.",
      "Spurs at bigger than 3/1 with Sky Bet is a real tempter. The market has gone completely overboard with the hangover factor from midweek and is offering up very tantalising prices on the home win.",
      "Spurs of course have lost 21 of 37 Premier League games but this just might be a bigger game for Ange Postecoglou than what the market is predicting.",
      "You get the impression he really wants to keep this job to try and build this Spurs team. As a manager he isn't going to get an opportunity like this anywhere else with the infrastructure and spending power on offer at Spurs - everything is set there behind the scenes to be a regular challenger.",
      "So, it's in his interest to make sure his team finish the season with a bit of positive momentum to take into those talks with Daniel Levy.",
      "And Brighton don't need to win this match. A point would be enough to finish eighth which gives them an outside chance of Conference League qualification. Brighton's defensive record still worries me too, conceding 16 goals in their last eight games to an expected goals against process of 1.8 per game which is borderline relegation levels of form.",
      "With a high-scoring draw a big runner, the double chance on Spurs at 5/4 with Sky Bet looks a big price.",
      "This has the potential to go down an extreme correct score route, such is the extra possibilities of goals on the final day.",
      "Incredibly though, Bournemouth have only scored more than one goal in just one of their last 13 home matches, which tells you everything you need to know about why they've fallen short in their play to make European football. There has been a huge underperformance at play when assessing their expected goals output though, scoring 13 goals in the last 13 when their expected goals figure is at 21.8.",
      "This might be the game where they bring those metrics closer together and give the Foxes a bit of a battering.",
      "The -2 handicap for Bournemouth makes appeal at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Being wrong is part of the job. It's something anyone in this line of work must accept.",
      "However, tipping Leif Davis to be the top assister in the Premier League at the start of the season at 100/1 turned out to be a new level of wrong. Much like Ipswich on the whole, he has been so disappointing in trying to make the step-up after ripping through League One and the Championship.",
      "He has bagged just two assists this season but there were signs of life from him at Leicester last weekend from an attacking standpoint, having two shots and a goal ruled out. He is 9/4 with Sky Bet to score or assist in a game that should be full of goalmouth action.",
      "Your mind always must be looking ahead in this game and one of the angles I'm most excited about backing next season is Declan Rice's total goals output.",
      "He could become one of Arsenal's top goalscorers next season playing in this attack-minded No 8 role and I'd be a confident backer at any price for him to improve on the total of four he's bagged in the Premier League this season. He is 7/2 with Sky Bet to score for the third league game running at St Mary's.",
      "We saw a little snapshot of Vitor Pereira not holding back in criticising his players in public following the 4-2 defeat to Crystal Palace. He's done some amazing work since joining but doubts remain about whether he can rein in his combustible nature to make his tenure one that will work in the longer term.",
      "It's hard to see how Wolves can stop Brentford scoring multiple goals in this one.",
      "The over 3.5 goals line looks attractive at 5/4 with Sky Bet, as does Yoane Wissa scoring at 11/8. The striker has landed for punters in this market in five of his last six games and has shown this season that there are few better around than him in front of goal in the Premier League. He can get his 20th goal of the campaign.",

      "\"So, yes, we've given him the permission to do that this week.",
      "\"It's a very important decision for his future. Of course, there's a lot of interest and rightly so. So that's been part of his week, he's been having some of those conversations.",
      "\"It looks, I think more likely than not, that he'll move on this summer. He has interest from pretty much every club in the league. I don't think there's many clubs in the world who wouldn't want to have him. So I think it's more likely than not that he'll move on.",
      "\"Of course, nothing's sorted, nothing's done or completed or even I think very, very, very close. That process will take its course.",
      "\"We'll, of course, be proud of the part that we've had in terms of Liam's development and his contribution this season.",
      "\"If he stays with us, we'll be delighted. If he does move on this summer, then it will be a positive sign for the club, a positive step for the club, to have developed and sold a player at that sort of level. Hopefully it will be a good move for him.\"",
      "\"Liam Delap could be the bargain buy of the summer.",
      "\"The striker has hit double figures for goals in his first full crack at the Premier League and that is even more impressive considering the struggles his relegated Ipswich have had at this level.",
      "\"He has been the driving force to their attack, scoring from all angles and distances while also hauling the team up the pitch with his runs with and without the ball. It's this range of skills which makes him stand out.",
      "\"A frontman with the ability to hold up the ball while also rank among the top 25 Premier League players for take-ons is a rare thing. His overperformance of his Expected Goals total demonstrates his finishing ability. Delap is ready for the next step.",
      "\"Where that will be and how Delap would fit into a different system is intriguing. But it is no wonder there is big interest in the 22-year-old England youth international.",
      "\"His £30m release clause fee is way below the quoted price tag for some strikers on the continent linked with a move to the Premier League who would be something more of a risk. Investing in Delap appears to be a smart move.\""

      "The Radar column also looks at the plight of Raheem Sterling as his former Man City team-mate Kevin De Bruyne offers a reminder of just how good he was, plus why Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze is one of the Premier League's best players to watch",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 16:09, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Man Utd's Amorim faith👍 De Bruyne's Sterling appreciation🦅 Eze's Crystal Palace scoring run",
      "There was a huge contrast in the messaging from the two managers in the press conference room at San Mames following Manchester United's Europa League final loss to Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Shortly before Ange Postecoglou, of all people, came in, winner's medal around his neck, and spoke about the importance of adapting his approach, Ruben Amorim had sat in the same seat and said the opposite: \"I will not change anything in the way I do things.\"",
      "Amorim's way of doing things brought him considerable success in Portugal, of course, and Manchester United knew what they were getting when they hired him. The former Sporting boss arrived having used a back three in 188 consecutive league and European games. Six months on, that number stands at 225.",
      "But his defiance still felt jarring in the context of his 17th defeat in 41 games as Manchester United's head coach. It also brought into sharp focus the dilemma now facing the club.",
      "Wednesday's defeat, by far the costliest of a miserable campaign given the financial implications of missing out on a Champions League spot, was yet another reminder that the vast majority of Amorim's players are unsuited to his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "It is clear that extensive changes are required to equip him with the players he needs to have a chance of making it work. But they will not come cheaply. That is problematic given the potential impact of no European football on the club's already-fraught finances.",
      "Besides, there is no guarantee the changes would bring success. Have the club's decision-makers seen enough in the last six months to suggest the level of investment required is worth the risk? Results have actually worsened since Amorim's appointment.",
      "They are banking on a drastic change of fortunes but they also have to consider where an expensive round of recruitment tailored to Amorim's specific set-up would leave them when he eventually goes.",
      "What use are expensively acquired wing-backs to a potential successor who prefers a back four? What use are narrow No 10s to one who favours touchline-hugging wingers?",
      "The accepted wisdom is that Manchester United need to break the cycle of signing players for specific managers then ripping up and starting again when a change is required. But the worry is that minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe now risks perpetuating it.",
      "Amorim is not alone in using a back three, of course. But he is certainly in a minority among managers. Across all Premier League games this season, back fours have been used 77 per cent of the time, with back threes only used 23 per cent of the time.",
      "The same disparity can be seen in Europe. Simone Inzaghi may yet win the Champions League with a back three but Inter Milan are one of only two sides to reach this season's knockout stages who habitually use a three over four, the other being Amorim's former club Sporting, who are already onto their second appointment since his exit, with Rui Borges having replaced Joao Pereira.",
      "It is not that the system cannot work, it is just that the pool of potential successors to Amorim who actually use it is a small one. While Manchester United appear committed to their man, with no plans to make a change, the reality is that the moment will come, and it might be sooner than they hope.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta gave Kieran Tierney and Jorginho the chance to say goodbye to the Emirates Stadium with late cameos in last Sunday's 1-0 win over Newcastle but Raheem Sterling, another player set to depart this summer, was an unused substitute.",
      "It remains to be seen whether he will get any minutes at Southampton on the final day but, having been unable to make a mark during his loan spell from Chelsea, he looked a slightly incongruous presence during Arsenal's lap of appreciation.",
      "With more than 600 senior games in his legs, Sterling is approaching the twilight of his career at 30 but there was a reminder of just how special he was this week when Kevin De Bruyne picked him out as his favourite team-mate during an interview with Jamie Redknapp.",
      "Those runs have become increasingly rare. Sterling's playing time has dropped to a new low this season. Arsenal fans haven't seen him at anything close to his best and neither have those of Chelsea, where he still has a year left to run on his contract.",
      "Sterling is unlikely to ever get a send-off like his former team-mate De Bruyne but his outstanding achievements, as a player who ranks among the Premier League's top 20 for both goals and assists, with 123 and 65 respectively in 395 games, should not be forgotten even as his powers wane.",
      "Eberechi Eze was given most of the evening off against Wolves on Tuesday following his match-winning heroics in Crystal Palace's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City but he still made his mark, adding a superb fourth goal only five minutes after his introduction.",
      "Attention will soon turn to his future. He will not be short of suitors this summer. But for now, provided he is not playing against your team, it is best to just enjoy a player flourishing into one of the Premier League's best. He has been a pleasure to watch this season.",
      "Bruno Guimaraes' completeness was the focus of last week's column. There was also a look at how Arsenal have missed Kai Havertz and the importance of Mikkel Damsgaard's pressing to Brentford."

      "Man Utd lost Europa League final to Spurs on Wednesday night to leave them without European football next season; Ruben Amorim said after the defeat he would leave \"the next day without any conversation about compensation\" if club's board and fans no longer wanted him.",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 17:20, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim is not at risk of being sacked by Manchester United despite the Europa League final loss to Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Amorim's appointment at United has always, and continues, to be seen as a longer-term project and the club's commitment to the Portuguese head coach is not contingent on one game.",
      "Sources say he continues to have the full support of the club.",
      "Speaking immediately after the 1-0 loss to Spurs, Amorim had said he would leave United \"the next day\" for \"no compensation\" if the club's board and fans no longer wanted him.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" said the 40-year-old.",
      "\"But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.\"",
      "Amorim took over at United in November with the club 13th in the table. They have slipped three places with Amorim knocked out of the three cup competitions in the process.",
      "Manchester United are now facing another summer rebuild under Amorim. Captain Bruno Fernandes, speaking moments after Amorim vowed not to quit, backed the United boss to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We just agreed that he's the right man,\" Fernandes said of his compatriot, who succeeded Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "\"He has done a lot of good things. We know that the manager is looked at by the results. Obviously we see more than that as players.",
      "\"We know for everyone it will be about him bringing back the positivity in the club, trying to bring the club back to fight for trophies, fight for the big trophies. And we all agree that he's the right man.\"",
      "Asked what he would have to say to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's decision-makers, the skipper said: \"It's not my decision, but I do think the manager is the right one.",
      "\"I don't think that it will be a better person to come into the job and to do the job. I know it's difficult to understand that, it's difficult to see that, but I still do think that he's the right man to lead the club.",
      "\"I do think that obviously the club is in a situation where it's easier to get a different one in because the results haven't been there.",
      "\"But as my other team-mates said, and I repeat myself, I do think he's the right man.\"",
      "Speaking after the final, a dejected Luke Shaw also claimed Amorim is the right man - with every single player needing to \"question ourselves on if we're good enough to be here\".",
      "\"We're all gutted, it's not how we saw the outcome to be honest,\" Shaw said. \"But it's not just tonight, this whole season, it's been nowhere near good enough. I think all of us have to question ourselves on if we're good enough to be here.",
      "\"For a team like Manchester [United], for the season we've had, it's not acceptable. We know that, we all know that, I know that. It's not where Manchester [United] should be.\"",
      "But asked about Amorim's credentials, Shaw said: \"I can say 100 per cent right now he's the right man. Results have not been good at all. I've been here for a long time now and been through different managers.",
      "\"Ruben, for me, I talk on my behalf and I can talk on behalf of all the players, he is 100 per cent the right manager to take us back to where this club should be.",
      "\"It's going to be a very difficult process, us as players, we've let a lot of people down, including Ruben. I will say it again, we've been nowhere near good enough the whole season.\"",
      "Paul Merson says Amorim's comments regarding leaving Old Trafford without compensation have given Manchester United a potential route to parting ways with their head coach in future.",
      "\"I don't think Amorim really wants to be there,\" Merson said.",
      "\"When you turn around and say, 'I'd leave tomorrow without any compensation', that tells me he wants to be put out of his misery.",
      "\"Manchester United are also in a position now where, if they don't want him, they've had a result. He said he'll walk away without any compensation so they've now got a way out. They now won't have to pay fortunes to get rid of him.",
      "\"There's so much work to be done at Manchester United. Amorim saw all this coming. He didn't want to come until the end of the season. He knew there was a lot of work to be done and there's a lot more now.",
      "\"It's worrying times for Manchester United. I don't see them finishing in the top half of the table next season. To say that about Manchester United is mind-blowing. It's mind-blowing to think that I'd be shocked if they finished in the top half of the table next season.\""
