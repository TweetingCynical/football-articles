      "Manchester United appointed Michael Carrick as interim head coach earlier this month(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have been told they should name Michael Carrick as their new permanent head coach if he delivers Champions League football for next season. Carrick was named by United as their head coach until the campaign's conclusion following Ruben Amorim's exit earlier this month.",
      "Darren Fletcher had been in charge of United's first-team for two matches after Amorim's departure before Carrick was given the job. United secured a 2-0 triumph over Manchester City in Carrick's opening fixture last weekend and will be eager to spring another surprise when they head to the Emirates Stadium to meet table-toppers Arsenal this afternoon.",
      "And former United forward Teddy Sheringham, speaking to BetMGM, believes: “There’s been a funny vibe at the football club for a while and Michael Carrick's gone in there and he's changed that vibe straight away.",
      "“Under [Ruben] Amorim there was no way you could see Manchester United beating Manchester City, but now, all of a sudden, they've beaten them!",
      "\"He’s instilled a real optimism within the club after only a few days of getting the job. They’ll be thinking they can go to Arsenal and get a result there now.",
      "“Football clubs can be changed around. You’ve just got to get the right vibe and the right way of getting around your players.",
      "“There's a lot of big egos in a football club but, if you rub them up the right way, those big performances can return very quickly.",
      "\"I know he’s only taken charge of one game, but Carrick has to be the favourite for the job after that Manchester City performance. He looks comfortable there, he's a Manchester United man, and with a bit of luck, which all managers need early on in their careers, I can see him doing really well.",
      "“I’d like to see a United personality in there. They understand the football club and what’s required to move the club forward.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“I think if they got into a Champions League spot, you've got to give Carrick the job. That would be an amazing achievement and I can’t really see how the United board could choose someone else.",
      "“It’s a tough ask, but that’s surely got to be the aim? We saw the way these players can perform against City.”",
      "Previewing the game against the Gunners on Friday, Carrick said: “I’m looking forward to the game. It’s a big challenge, you know, they’re a very good team. It’s pretty obvious to say that.",
      "Michael Carrick celebrates with Matheus Cunha after Manchester United's win over Manchester City(Image: (James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images))",
      "\"They’ve got so many strong points to their game, and to their squad. It’s a big challenge, they are where they are for a reason and where they are in the Champions League for a reason, so we’re fully aware of that and not taking that lightly at all.",
      "\"We feel we’re in a good place and we’re looking forward to the game, so it’s where we want to be, with that real positive energy and enthusiasm, to go there and be positive, but for sure we know it's not going to come easy.”",

      "Michael Carrick's appointment has been well received by those in the academy(Image: Photo by Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United academy stars and their parents were thrilled to see the back of Ruben Amorim after he was critical of the youth set-up whilst he made little use of their next generation.",
      "Michael Carrick has been appointed as his replacement until the end of the season and his arrival has been well received given his understanding of the club and its traditions - with using academy players a key part of their DNA.",
      "Amorim, despite the club's poor form throughout his tenure, rarely turned to the academy to utilise their talent. His attitude and sporadic use of Kobbie Mainoo was a concern with the midfielder previously a big hit under Erik ten Hag. His reduced minutes then saw him linked with a loan move.",
      "In December the Portuguese boss hit out at United’s young stars, including striker Chido Obi and Harry Amass, as he claimed: “We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that’s that’s the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.”",
      "Carrick in the building is now seen as a huge plus. The ex-midfielder's son plays for the U16s and the parents of those in the set-up believe he will have a greater understanding.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "A source told The Sun: “Carrick has been a regular at the training ground following the progress of his son. He is a lovely welcoming guy who always has time for everyone. People respect him and admire him because of his United career, but they also feel like he gets what it means to have a son in the academy. Parents were appalled by Amorim’s comments. Anyone in professional football should know how hard it is to make a career in football at any level, let alone at United.”",
      "On Tuesday Carrick and his coaching team watched United's under-21s play against Sporting Lisbon. Darren Fletcher, who managed United for two games as caretaker following Amorim’s sacking, is also highly thought of by academy parents.",
      "Ruben Amorim made minimal use of Kobbie Mainoo before his sacking(Image: PA)",
      "The source added: “He is respected and well regarded by the kids and the parents. It’s great for a parent to hear Darren Fletcher shouting the name of their son during a game because you know he knows his talents and areas of weakness.”",
      "The likes of JJ Gabriel and Kai Rooney are among the players coming through the ranks with the former having a particularly high reputation.",
      "Since 1937 United have always included an academy player in their matchday side - a run that is now spanning more than 4,300 matches.",

      "Michael Carrick's relationship with Bruno Fernandes goes back several years(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Few Manchester United players will be more thrilled by Michael Carrick's return to the dugout than Bruno Fernandes. The Portugal international not only featured under Carrick during his initial interim stint in charge back in 2021 but also predicted a bright future for him in management.",
      "Carrick, who was named United head coach until the end of the 2025/26 season earlier this month following Ruben Amorim's exit, filled a similar gap after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked just over four years ago. Although he managed only three matches before Ralf Rangnick took over, Carrick quickly boosted morale at Old Trafford, guiding the team to notable wins over Villarreal and Arsenal.",
      "After the latter, Fernandes rushed to Carrick for a hug and later heaped praise on him in his post-match interview. \"Honestly for me Michael can be a really good manager in the future if he gets that chance,\" the now 31-year-old said.",
      "\"He knows how to speak, he knows a lot of football. He was one of the great players that not a lot of people talk about. For what I have seen he can be a top coach.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Those words now seem almost prophetic, with Carrick back at United, albeit temporarily. After stepping aside for Rangnick, Carrick - who had been part of both Jose Mourinho's and Solskjaer's coaching teams - ended a 15-year association with the Red Devils that started when he joined from Tottenham as a player in 2006.",
      "His managerial career truly began when he took charge of Middlesbrough in 2022. He quickly steered the club out of Championship relegation danger by winning 16 of his first 23 matches, finishing the season with Boro in the play-offs, though they were beaten by Coventry in the semi-finals.",
      "In his second year at the Riverside Stadium, Carrick narrowly missed out on the play-offs, ending up eighth, but led the team to the League Cup semi-finals - their first since lifting the trophy in 2004. A year later, however, he was dismissed after another play-off miss, with the team finishing 10th that season.",
      "Fernandes tipped Carrick for the top following Man United's 3-2 win over Arsenal in December 2021(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Even so, he won widespread acclaim for the attacking, flowing football his side played during his tenure. That reputation may have helped tip the scales when United were searching for a new head coach, as the club were also in advanced discussions with Solskjaer at the time.",
      "Carrick eventually secured the role - and, similar to his time at Middlesbrough, quickly made an impact. In his first match back, he orchestrated a commanding 2-0 victory over Manchester City, earning high praise for his tactical approach.",
      "Next up is a trip to title contenders Arsenal, who have been beaten only once by United in the league since Carrick oversaw a 3-2 win in his final caretaker game in 2021.",
      "If he can work the same magic against the Gunners on Sunday, Carrick could not only turn his short-term appointment into a permanent position at Old Trafford but also prove that Bruno Fernandes was right on the money about his managerial potential.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Arsenal are in charge of the Premier League title race(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Theo Walcott is making a very good impression as a pundit, insightful and articulate. And judging by his question to Wayne Rooney last Tuesday, Walcott has a mischievous sense of humour.",
      "How would your 2008 Manchester United team get on against Arsenal of 2026? “We’d batter them,” said Rooney.",
      "And he is almost certainly right, of course. Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and the rest were all-conquering.",
      "But ‘batter them’? Probably not. No, this is an Arsenal team that has won nothing yet but it is an Arsenal team that does not get battered. It does not get beaten much, either, but when it does happen, it tends not to be comprehensive.",
      "Their last five Premier League defeats have come by the odd goal. You have to go back to October, 2024, for a losing Premier League margin greater than one.",
      "So, no, United’s 2008 vintage would almost certainly have too much for the current Arsenal line-up but it would be no cakewalk. And perhaps there will be a slightly different - at least more hesitant - answer if Theo asks Wazza the same question in a couple of years’ time.",
      "Just over six years into his tenure, it is right to say he will have no excuses for failing to win the Premier League title that has eluded Arsenal for over two decades. But, even though it is so far into his time, it still feels like this season could be the beginning of a golden Mikel Arteta era, rather than a crowning point.",
      "Theo Walcott asked Wayne Rooney if Manchester United's class of 2008 would beat today's Arsenal(Image: Prime Video)",
      "It does not happen often at an elite European club, but Arteta has been afforded a learning curve that has extended for over half a decade. He is calmer now, he is less reactionary, emotions are kept in tighter check in positive and negative moments. And don’t forget, Arteta is only 43 years of age.",
      "This season, though, is a watershed in his progression. And while Arsenal fans must be sick and tired of hearing it, this title race is a gift horse they cannot afford to look in the mouth.",
      "Coming into this weekend, Manchester City had 43 points and you have to go back to the 2002/03 season to find a second-placed team that had fewer points after 22 matches. Coming into this weekend, Liverpool had 36 points, the lowest on Premier League record for a team sitting fourth after 22 matches.",
      "Which goes to show that, below Arsenal, it really has all been much of a muchness. And there is every chance that the meeting with Manchester United at the Emirates could be one of the trickiest hurdles left for Arsenal to negotiate.",
      "Arsenal made sure of top-eight qualification in the Champions League with a win at Inter Milan(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "No, this is not the United of 2007/08, but the unpredictable United of 2025/26 does have a decent record against what we would see as blue-chip opposition, the win in the Manchester derby complementing a victory at Anfield this season. United and Arsenal were closely matched in an opening game of the season that was settled by Riccardo Calafiori’s early goal.",
      "And of course, not only will Michael Carrick’s side be buoyant, they are fresh and lightly-raced. This will be Arsenal’s 35th game of the season and United’s 25th. As was the case ahead of City’s loss at Old Trafford, Arsenal played in midweek while United did not.",
      "But Arsenal are made of sterner stuff and, unlike Pep Guardiola’s team, have the defensive nous and strength to deal with United’s counter-attacking threat. Late Sunday afternoon should be another step towards that Premier League title, a reward for many years of hard work … but just the start of a golden Arteta era.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick's impact at Manchester United has already been felt by his squad(Image: (Photo by Darren Staples / AFP via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United's squad have been forced to adapt to numerous fresh rules over recent years. Michael Carrick is the latest figure to take the reins at Old Trafford – and similar to his predecessors – he's implemented a new set of standards at the club.",
      "The United icon introduced one modification following his return to Old Trafford after Ruben Amorim's departure following 14 months at the helm. It was following last week's derby triumph over Manchester City that the Daily Mail revealed Carrick has made training sessions at Carrington briefer whilst boosting their intensity to enhance United's performances.",
      "The 44-year-old's choice to modify the training regime is believed to have received a favourable response from the squad. Alongside this alteration, training sessions have also featured greater emphasis on individual work with the first-team players.",
      "Like his predecessor, Amorim also tried to leave his mark on the club through three fundamental principles he established during his time at Old Trafford. The 40-year-old initially prohibited players from using international breaks as chances to take holidays after the backlash Marcus Rashford and Casemiro faced for travelling to the United States last year.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Amorim also chose to prohibit food in the changing room on match days and barred his coaching team from providing players with complex tactical guidance. The Portuguese manager stated that if he couldn't communicate a strategic concept in a single sentence, it shouldn't be passed on to his squad until it could be made simpler.",
      "Renowned for his thorough methodology, it was Erik ten Hag who established five fundamental regulations for his team to observe. The Dutchman, who was dismissed by United in October 2024, declared he would omit any player who arrived late for training sessions or team gatherings.",
      "It was this regulation that Rashford violated in late December 2022 after the England international acknowledged he was relegated to the substitutes' bench in a fixture against Wolves because he overslept and missed a team meeting.",
      "Ruben Amorim had three key principles he instructed his players and staff to abide by(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Ten Hag also notified his players that no alcoholic beverages should be consumed during match weeks, whilst insisting the same chefs prepare his squad's meals, rather than personal catering personnel employed by players to do so.",
      "Additional requirements regarding his squad's physical condition meant each player received a bespoke nutrition programme whilst having their Body Mass Index (BMI) monitored monthly to guarantee they maintained optimal fitness.",
      "Erik ten Hag was known for his meticulous approach to coaching(Image: Andrew Kearns - CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "To ensure disruption remained minimal concerning internal matters, Ten Hag directed his players to approach him directly if they encountered problems, rather than consulting their representatives.",
      "With United travelling to league leaders Arsenal on Sunday, it presents an ideal chance for Carrick's team to showcase once more the influence the ex-midfielder has wielded in revitalising them.",

      "Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is leaving Manchester United at the end of the season, and now attention has turned to acquiring his successor. The former Real Madrid man has been a permanent fixture in the middle of the park since penning a deal in 2022, so his absence will be keenly felt.",
      "Thankfully, there are plenty of good, long-term options for United to look at. The club has long been linked with Premier League trio Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson, although a report from I Paper on Saturday suggested that the latter prefers a move to Manchester City.",
      "Ex-United defender Mikael Silvestre, who played for the club under Sir Alex Ferguson between 1999 and 2008, has already said that signing someone in Casemiro's position is of utmost priority in January, and has given his approval to sign two players.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "Speaking to Esports Insider, he said: \"Man United should sign a centre midfielder in January. If the club are playing in Europe next season, they’ll need more depth in the middle of the park.",
      "\"There are plenty of options available on the market too, and I believe Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace and Carlos Baleba at Brighton would both be great additions to the squad.\"",
      "Silvestre continued: \"United are too light in that position at the moment. Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are good options to occupy a place in the centre midfield, but if one gets injured, you’ve got no backup options. They need a strong fourth man to cover that position, especially if they’re playing in multiple competitions next year.\"",
      "Casemiro leaves United having made a superb impression on supporters. In his pomp at Madrid, he was one of the best players in world football, and many wondered whether he still had it in him when he made the switch.",
      "However, he proved the doubters wrong and went on to play 146 games for the club, scoring 21 goals. At 33, a new challenge, perhaps in Saudi Arabia, awaits him.",
      "Casemiro's time in Manchester is up(Image: Photo by Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Part of United's statement read: \"A serial winner, Casemiro was unveiled at Old Trafford in August 2022, and quickly became a fan favourite due to his combative nature and ability to score goals at crucial times.",
      "\"The Brazil captain played a major role in helping United to win the 2023 Carabao Cup, scoring a header in a colossal performance against Newcastle United.",
      "\"The 33-year-old also won the Emirates FA Cup in 2024. Supporters will have the opportunity to recognise Casemiro’s contributions at the final home game of the season, against Nottingham Forest.\"",

      "United were on the lookout for a head coach until the end of the season and it eventually came down to a straight fight between Carrick and Solskjaer. Carrick had worked under Solskjaer when he was the Red Devils boss and the Norwegian hasn't shied away from saying he'd love another crack.",
      "It was Carrick who got the nod however, but there appears no ill feeling with Solskjaer happy to lend a helping hand should the new man at the helm need it.",
      "The 44-year-old got off to the dream start as he downed Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford last Saturday. His next assignment is even tougher with the Manchester outfit heading to Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday afternoon - but Carrick will have Solskjaer firmly in his corner.",
      "He said: \"I spoke to him. I’m close (to him). We've been through a lot together, so he's been fully supportive, as you'd expect. He's some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result.\"",

      "He added: \"You have conversations and I've got a lot of friends in places that I can pick on if I need to. I'm not one that bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he's certainly there if ever I need him.\"",
      "It is understood that Carrick got the nod from the United hierarchy after several players made it clear they wanted him - not Solskjaer - to get the job until the end of the season.

      "\"Games from three or four years ago, it's done, it's in the past,\" he said. \"So as much as the experience helps you in certain moments, I think it’s a totally different game. I think the confidence I'm taking into the game is what we've seen since I've been here, between me and my staff, in terms of the game itself, training and how the boys were gone about it.\"",

Darren Fletcher took charge of two games this month before former player Carrick was named as manager for what is expected to be a brief stint before a new permanent boss is found in the summer.",

      "Amorim opted to ban food in his dressing room, but Carrick is attempting to turn his into a place where players feel appreciated. He has introduced a new ethos that players are not to leave the dressing room until they feel they have been spoken to.",
      "Harry Maguire has reportedly been singled out as someone who will lead this charge and be a vocal presence in the changing room. He started the win over City and played admirably at the back.",
      "This approach differs significantly from that of Amorim, who reports suggest often sent players home from games without speaking to them. His ban on food suggests that he kept his dressing room in a very particular order.",
      "The club's dressing room is set for change(Image: Getty)",
      "While Amorim did not necessarily have an eye for incorporating academy stars into his side, even exiling the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and unsettling Mainoo, Carrick is set to take a different approach.",
      "The Portuguese boss did help players like Chido Obi and Harry Amass make their first-team debuts but compared to other coaches, he did not utilise Carrington's finest players as often.",
      "Reports suggest that Carrick, on the other hand, will place a fundamental importance on giving young players a chance. He brought back youngsters such as Habeeb Ogunneye from loan and Joe Hugill to train with the first team immediately after being installed.",

      "England midfielder Elliot Anderson has been linked with both Manchester clubs(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have been off the pace in terms of activity in the January transfer window, despite just over a week remaining for business to be sealed. However, that isn't to say that the Red Devils haven't been linked with a number of names this month.",
      "Michael Carrick has seemingly set his undivided attention on gelling with his current crop of players rather than scouring the market for improvements, despite issues in certain areas of the pitch. Casemiro will leave his current club at the end of the season, while an ageing defence including the likes of England duo, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw has also raised questions.",
      "While the Red Devils have been linked with Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson as an alternative to Carlos Baleba, given they were unable to secure the £100million Brighton star last summer, the midfielder could actually be on his way to Manchester City instead.",
      "Goal.com state that United have \"conceded\" that Anderson favours a move to the Etihad Stadium, instead of Old Trafford. Forest are adamant that the 23-year-old will not leave his current club this month, and are anticipated to demand around £100m to let him leave in the summer.",
      "A report from the I, meanwhile, states: \"There's a growing belief Anderson would snub United for a move to rivals Manchester City.\" If true, it will come as yet another bitter blow to the Premier League heavyweights, who missed out on Antoine Semenyo to their neighbours earlier this month.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Liam Rosenior has claimed that star man Cole Palmer is currently content with Chelsea, despite claims that he is unsettled in west London and was seeking a move back to Manchester. The head coach said: \"I've had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems very happy to be here.",
      "\"He's a huge part in our long-term plans. And my job and the club's job is to get him into a situation where he can consistently perform to the level he wants to.",

      "The Englishman has been a revelation for the Blues since his 2023 move from Manchester City to Stamford Bridge, scoring 48 goals and bagging 29 assists in 110 appearances.",
      "Casemiro announced earlier this week that he will depart United this summer when his contract expires. While his future in the world of football beyond the coming months is unknown, it is suggested that LA Galaxy could opt to sign him as a free agent.",
      "Elsewhere, clubs in Saudi Arabia and Brazil have also been mentioned as possible landing spots for the 33-year-old midfielder. It comes after Casemiro broke the news of his departure come season's end.",
      "Taking to social media, he wrote: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",

      "For Arsenal, a victory would mean their top spot in the table remains secure as they chase their first league title since 2004. Over the years, both teams have had some incredible players that drove them to new heights both domestically and in Europe.",
      "Think Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Wayne Rooney, Dennis Bergkamp - big game players for big game moments. The rise of the Gunners this season has begged the question - how would they fare against Premier League sides of old?",

      "While David Raya has been an impressive signing for Arsenal, Edwin van der Sar is the clear winner of this battle. With 132 clean sheets in 313 Premier League appearances, the Dutch man mountain pulled out some unbelievable stops during his career with United.",
      "Gary Neville spent most of the 2007/08 season out injured, with Wes Brown and John O'Shea filling in during his absence. Jurrien Timber gets my vote here on this merit, although the Dutch defender has been hugely important for the Gunners throughout this campaign so far.",
      "The centre-half slots may be an argument for some but are a no-brainer in my eyes. Yes, William Saliba and Gabriel have been an impressive partnership in north London and a defining part of the Arsenal defence.",
      "However, the no-nonsense defending and ability to stick his body on the line of Nemanja Vidic pips him to the starting spot.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is considered a Premier League icon and rightfully so. With 504 Premier League appearances under his belt, the defender may not have the goal threat Gabriel holds - but he knew exactly how to play his position to its fullest.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori is undoubtedly an excellent player who manages the overlapping style that Mikel Arteta loves in a fullback.",
      "But Evra's origins as a forward made him exceptionally dangerous even in defence and his 14 major honours with United certainly showcase his legendary status.",
      "Declan Rice has been a man reborn this season. The 12 goal contributions may not seem like much but the England international's ability to take charge in midfield and dictate play gets him in the combined XI over current United boss Michael Carrick.",
      "A genius with a loyalty to United that can never be questioned, Scholes is the ultimate midfielder. He can defend, attack, score a wondergoal and set up another.",
      "He did all this and more throughout a 20-year career with the club and while Martin Zubimendi has scored some screamers, he doesn't come close to Salford's very own magician.",
      "It felt tough placing Odegaard in this slot over Ryan Giggs, considering the United star's history in the Premier League, but him being 34 at the time greatly cost him a spot.",
      "Meanwhile, the Norwegian midfielder proudly wears the captain's armband for Arsenal and has been their go-to player during many periods of difficulty in the past.",
      "This one shouldn't raise any questions. Both Gabriel Martinelli and Leonardo Trossard are good players for Arsenal, but they pale in comparison to one of the greatest players of all time.",
      "Considering Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or during the 2007/08 season, this is the most obvious pick for the combined XI.",
      "Widely regarded as one of the greatest attackers the Premier League has ever seen, Rooney played in a number of positions across the frontline. Pitting him against Viktor Gyokeres felt almost mean but slightly less unfair than if Ronaldo was in the number nine position.",
      "Saka has been one of the faces of the Premier League since he burst onto the scene in 2018. Arsenal's 'Starboy' has been consistently performing for them and a homegrown talent with a sky-is-the-limit future deserves his spot in this line-up."

      "He has nine goals to his name in all competitions and it is expected that the Serie A giants will activate their option to sign him permanently. While Hojlund has enjoyed a bright season thus far, he could face added competition for his position in the near future.",

      "“If I don’t score any more goals this season and we win another trophy, then I’d be happy with that.

      "Manchester United travel to the Emirates this afternoon looking to maintain their magical start under Michael Carrick. The Reds beat Manchester City in the derby last weekend with a convincing 2-0 victory to hand the interim boss a dream start to the job.",
      "The task today is an even tougher one as they visit league leaders Arsenal. The Gunners are four points clear at the top and have lost twice in the league all season.",
      "Carrick has a near fully-fit squad to choose from although Matthijs de Ligt remains sidelined with injury. Joshua Zirkzee is also absent and Carrick must decide whether to recall either Benjamin Sesko or Matheus Cunha to the XI after both were on the bench for the derby.",
      "United will move above Liverpool if they avoid defeat while a victory will ensure they end the weekend in fourth place. We will have all the build-up, action, reaction and analysis right here in the live blog so stay with us.",
      "The teams have returned to the dressing rooms after completing their warm-ups.",
      "Carrick has hinted his unchanged team will play slightly differently.",
      "\"I've said during the week, every game is different, even one half from the other half. We're in good shape, we've had a good week on the training ground and the boys are in good shape.",
      "\"This has been a tough place to come for many teams. They are a good team. We have a good challenge ahead, but I'm looking forward to it.",
      "No surprise to see an unchanged team after last week’s performance. Probably makes sense to bring Sesko in against Fulham but the tactical challenge today isn’t a million miles away from last week and the focus will again be on transitions. Sesko joined amongst the substitutes by Viktor Gyokeres, so neither big-money striker signing starts today.",
      "Carrick has named an unchanged team, which is not surprising after last weekend's excellent win in the Manchester derby. The bench is strong again, and Cunha will be fired up to make an impact if he gets a chance to come on. The Brazilian looked sharp when he was introduced in the second half against City.",
      "XI | Lammens, Dalot, Martinez, Maguire, Shaw, Casemiro, Mainoo, Fernandes (c), Amad, Mbeumo, Dorgu.",
      "Subs | Bayindir, Heaven, Malacia, Mazraoui, Yoro, Ugarte, Mount, Cunha, Sesko.",
      "There has been plenty of discussion around Sesko and Gyokeres coming into this game, a pair of No. 9s signed at great expense who could have easily ended up at the other club instead. United think they are on to a winner long-term with Sesko, but he could find himself on the bench again today. His four Premier League goals have come at one every 260 minutes. Gyokeres’ five at one every 270 minutes. The Swede has found some form with goals in the Carabao Cup and Champions League but he has been unconvincing and is escaping more scrutiny because of Arsenal’s strong position in the league table.",
      "United fans have joked Dorgu is about to embark on his ‘Gareth Bale arc’ by taking his performances to a new level playing on the wing. Dorgu was excellent last weekend, vindicating his selection over Cunha by scoring to make it 2-0, and should retain his starting role. Amorim first played Dorgu in an advanced position against Newcastle on Boxing Day, and he appears to enjoy himself further up the pitch. I asked Carrick whether his long-term future could lie on the wing and, although he didn’t want to pin him down to a permanent position, he admitted he’s been impressed by Dorgu on the wing. He’s got a way to go before he can seriously be compared to Bale, though.",
      "Arsenal were fortunate to win 1-0 at Old Trafford on the opening day of the season. Bayindir flapped at a corner and his mistake was the difference. United will have a different goalkeeper in between the sticks and a new manager on the touchline this afternoon. August’s game may not feel relevant, but it should give the players encouragement they can get a result at the Emirates, especially after the superb win against City.",
      "The last time United won here in the Premier League it was Jesse Lingard who scored two of the three goals, with Antonio Valencia getting the other. David de Gea was the hero, though, with a scarcely believable performance in goal, making 14 saves in the 3-1 win. There have been seven visits since then, six of them lost. Solskjaer, Rangnick, Ten Hag and Amorim have all brought United teams here in the Premier League and failed to win since that success under Jose Mourinho. No wonder Martin Odegaard writes in his programme notes that “we have a good record against them lately, and that can definitely help when you go into the matches.”",
      "I’d pick an unchanged team after the Manchester derby triumph. Carrick picked a striker-less front three, naming Sesko on the bench, and it feels logical to stick by that attack again given Arsenal’s presence in defence. Gabriel and Salina are brilliant and Sesko probably wouldn’t have much joy in the air against that pair, so United should try to play around their opponents with the pace of Dorgu, Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "The return of Mazraoui gives Carrick a strong squad today. De Ligt and Zirkzee are the only first-teamers missing and the head coach has plenty of options to pick from. I would be very tempted to stick with the side that beat City last week. This is a different tactical test but if there is one thing Arsenal’s physical back four don’t want, you would think it would be a No. 9 who doesn’t give them a stationary target. Mbeumo’s movement and ability to drop deep could create space for others.",
      "Mazraoui has been included in the squad for the first time since representing Morocco at AFCON. De Ligt remains sidelined with a back injury. Amorim predicted the Dutchman would be absent for just a game when he was initially assessed, but De Ligt has been unavailable for almost two months now. It’s a shame that he picked up that issue because he was having an excellent season and was regarded as one of the team’s standout performers, along with Mbeumo, in early November. Zirkzee is still out.",
      "The press room at the Emirates is big but it’s already busy ahead of this game. Some big names about as well. Peter Schmeichel and Lee Dixon having a chat in the queue for good. Jaap Stam stood just behind them and Gary Neville floating around as well. They’ve all played in some mammoth United-Arsenal fixtures.",
      "There are no direct trains from Manchester to London today, which is ridiculous. The majority of United fans will head down on coaches. I had to drive to Leeds to get a direct train to King’s Cross. It didn’t stop raining during that drive across and conditions will be difficult at the Emirates if the weather was similar in the capital this morning. Arsenal are not a pretty team to watch even when conditions are good. They will try to exploit United from set-pieces, which is what they have become known for with Arteta in charge.",
      "Arsenal are the favourites to win this afternoon.",

      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "\"A lot of fans feel the team is missing a Carrick-style midfielder,\" said a journalist at Carrington on Friday afternoon. Carrick quipped: \"They probably weren't saying that when I was playing, though, were they?\"",
      "Even the head of football communications was laughing at the joke. Carrick has been business-like during his Manchester United press conferences so far, but this remark offered a glimpse into his personality. Carrick then provided a serious answer when asked whether his opinion would be canvassed on a new midfield signing to replace Casemiro, who announced he will leave United at the end of the season.",

      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Read more here",
      "United have kept themselves firmly in the hunt for a place in the top-four and will be right in the mix at the end of today if they can beat Arsenal. The table toppers have not lost since the beginning of December and have not tasted defeat at the Emirates Stadium all season.",
      "So the Reds know the scale of the challenge which awaits them and Carrick's team selection is therefore crucial. Having dealt with Erling Haaland perfectly last weekend, United have to start Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez together again at the Emirates Stadium. Ayden Heaven would love a run out against his old club, but the experienced duo works better.",

      "De Ligt has been missing since the victory over Crystal Palace with a back issue which has persisted longer than was expected. Carrick said in his pre-match press conference he hoped the defender would return to training in the next couple of weeks.",
      "Zirkzee has a small issue and should be back soon after missing the City win. Noussair Mazraoui was handed an extended break following the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final but has since returned to the squad.",

      "When asked whether he'd spoken to Solskjaer, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I spoke to him. I'm close, we've been through a lot together, so he's been fully supportive and as you'd expect. He's some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result.\"",
      "Discussing whether he would pick Solskjaer's brains, he responded: \"I think friendships, you have conversations, I've got a lot of friends in places that I can kind of pick on if I need to be. I'm not one who bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he's certainly there if ever I need him.\"",
      "Carrick served as United caretaker after Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. He left the position with an undefeated record, which included a 3-2 victory against Arsenal, but he does not believe that previous encounter against Mikel Arteta is relevant ahead of this weekend's clash against the Gunners.",

      "Manchester United return to Premier League action this afternoon as they travel to Arsenal in the Premier League. The Reds are full of confidence, according to interim head coach Michael Carrick and they have every reason to be after a brilliant victory over Manchester City last weekend.",
      "United have kept themselves firmly in the hunt for a place in the top-four and will be right in the mix at the end of today if they can beat Arsenal. The table toppers have not lost since the beginning of December and have not tasted defeat at the Emirates Stadium all season.",
      "So the Reds know the scale of the challenge which awaits them and Carrick's team selection is therefore crucial. Having dealt with Erling Haaland perfectly last weekend, United have to start Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez together again at the Emirates Stadium. Ayden Heaven would love a run out against his old club, but the experienced duo works better.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "It is no secret how much Arsenal love to use set pieces and so many of their goals come from dead ball scenarios. Both Maguire and Martinez are experienced enough to deal with that sort of bombardment this weekend.",
      "In midfield, Casemiro announced his exit from United at the end of the season to stop any speculation circulating about his future. While he may be gone at the end of this season, he still has to start when available. The Brazilian is United's best holding midfielder and will be needed against the Gunners.",
      "Alongside him should be Kobbie Mainoo. He was frozen out under Ruben Amorim but showed no signs of rustiness against City last weekend.",

      "But, having scored and looking so dangerous on the counter in the last game, Mbeumo has to start again while Sesko will once again be forced to miss out. Matheus Cunha is another one likely to be on the bench again but with him, Mason Mount and Sesko there, United suddenly have options if they need to change the game.",

      "Carrick pictured with Casemiro.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "\"A lot of fans feel the team is missing a Carrick-style midfielder,\" said a journalist at Carrington on Friday afternoon. Carrick quipped: \"They probably weren't saying that when I was playing, though, were they?\"",
      "Even the head of football communications was laughing at the joke. Carrick has been business-like during his Manchester United press conferences so far, but this remark offered a glimpse into his personality. Carrick then provided a serious answer when asked whether his opinion would be canvassed on a new midfield signing to replace Casemiro, who announced he will leave United at the end of the season.",
      "\"I'm certainly in this position to do that,\" Carrick said once the chuckles quietened. \"And as I said, I think, making decisions for the club moving forward, whatever that may be, I'm fully committed to that.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Naturally, as a midfielder, then there's a big tendency towards that anyway, but taking that away from it and now being where I am in the position I am, certainly would be part of those conversations and moving forward because it's important when we get the next steps right in terms of moving forward as a team and there's a squad and putting the right things in place. So, yeah, I'll be part of that in the right way.\"",
      "The first half of the week was dominated by post-Manchester derby coverage. The headline from the second half of the week was that Casemiro was leaving after four years at the club.",
      "United agreed to Casemiro’s request to confirm his summer departure at this time, and a video with the Brazilian explaining his decision was released on club channels. United sources also said the decision not to renew Casemiro's contract had been made well in advance of the announcement.",
      "Casemiro wanted to avoid speculation about his future during the remainder of the season, and his representatives can engage with potential suitors over his next move now that confirmation is out there.",
      "He said: “I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life. From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.”",
      "Casemiro posing after announcing his exit.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "The conversation about who will be brought in to succeed Casemiro has rumbled throughout this season, and will only grow louder as the summer transfer window approaches.",
      "United considered a move for Carlos Baleba last summer. Brighton valued the midfielder in excess of £100million, and United focused their resources on strengthening other areas of the team. Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have also been tracked.",
      "There are concerns with all three of those targets, though. Baleba has struggled this season, looking a shade of the player he was last term, and Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler admitted a few months ago that reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford had negatively impacted his performances.",
      "\"I think it’s normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,\" Hurzeler said. It’s not easy for this player to handle it. Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",
      "\"But he’s a young player and I think that’s something we have to accept, that young players don’t always have the face we want to see. It’s our responsibility to help them in the right moments.\"",
      "When asked specifically if the interest from United had affected the midfielder, the Brighton boss added: \"I think everyone gets affected, especially when you are that young and you hear these kinds of things, no matter if they are wrong or right. But it’s just noise we don’t need.\"",
      "Baleba hasn't been at his best this season.(Image: 2025 Allstar)",
      "Anderson and Wharton have similar profiles. They are both modern English No.6s, players who excel by spraying the ball around on the pitch, and they are not necessarily best at breaking up play and defending.",
      "Anderson has established himself as a rising star since moving to Forest from Newcastle, and excelled when he made his England debut during the September international break.",
      "\"Very good. He was a bit nervous this week but then did good,\" said Thomas Tuchel following his first England appearance. The German praised Anderson again last month, describing him as \"talented\" and \"tough\".",
      "Newcastle did not want to sell Whitley Bay-born Anderson, who came through their academy, but Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) forced them into sanctioning an exit in 2024. Many have earmarked Anderson for a bigger move in the near future, but he would also command a fee in the region of £100m.",
      "Crystal Palace will be reluctant to sell Wharton this summer after a fire sale of their best players. A fee of £100m has already been touted for Wharton, who is contracted at Selhurst Park until the summer of 2029.",
      "There's a lot at stake this summer. United cannot afford to make a mistake in their hunt for a replacement for Casemiro, especially when such large sums are likely to be involved.",
      "It will help that United's decision-makers can lean on Carrick for his opinion ahead of the transfer window. Tapping into the thoughts of one of the finest English midfielders ever isn't a bad option to have.",
      "Carrick's admission that he is positioned to give advice on summer targets may also be seen as a hint about his future.",

      "Michael Carrick revealed Casemiro is \"desperate\" to finish on a high at Manchester United after the midfielder confirmed he will leave the club at the end of this season. United confirmed the Brazilian will depart when his contract expires in the summer, with the announcement made on Thursday to provide clarity on his future.",
      "That allows Casemiro time to assess his options over his next move, but Carrick insists his commitment cannot be questioned. Confirmation of his exit after four years at the club comes just days after he produced an outstanding performance in the Manchester derby.",
      "Casemiro again showed his passion for the club with some jubilant celebrations in the Old Trafford victory against City and he is likely to keep his place in the side for the trip to Arsenal this weekend. Although United have only the Premier League to focus on for the remainder of the season, Casemiro can play a part in returning them to the Champions League and Carrick has held talks with him this week about leaving on a positive note.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I think the announcement for Case was for clarity as much as anything, it was decided anyway before I arrived so it's not just a knee-jerk kind of decision,\" said the United head coach.",
      "\"The type of personality, the character that he is, I think it shows with his performance last week, where he is mentally and how much it means for him to be here and to finish this season strong. I've already had that conversation with him and he's desperate to do well and finish well. It's good to see, so I've got no doubt about him at all.\"",
      "Harry Maguire is also out of contract at the end of this season and like Casemiro delivered an excellent display in the derby last weekend, returning to the starting XI after two months out with a thigh injury. His future isn't yet sealed and Carrick confirmed talks will be taking place over the next couple of months.",
      "\"I think that's just coming into that time of the season really with contracts. January is January in the window,\" he said. \"Coming towards the end of the season in terms of contracts and decisions and that will obviously be taken and discussed in good time really, and at the right time.\"",
      "Carrick did suggest he would offer his thoughts on Maguire's future, at least, with director of football Jason Wilcox set to take the lead on talks.",
      "\"I think the important thing for me is any decision I make or my staff make or the club make, it's not short-term, it's not just to get through to the end of the season,\" he said.",
      "\"I've got responsibility for whatever happens next to be in in a good place and moving forward to make the right decisions. So, as time goes on I'm sure I'll be part of it and we'll work our way through it.\"",

      "Chido Obi scored against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Carrick attended to show further support for the academy after watching the Under-21s in action on Tuesday. Carrick spoke about the importance of the Youth Cup and said that he was \"excited\" to attend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Steve Holland and Jonny Evans were also spotted in the directors' box. Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is understood to have welcomed the presence of the first-team staff at youth games again. Ruben Amorim did not show a similar interest during his one-and-a-half tenure in Manchester.",
      "Rooney tried to avoid attention when he arrived at Old Trafford, but a hood did not succeed in disguising his identity from a few excited supporters outside the ground, who stopped him for photographs.",
      "It was a big story that Rooney's son was on the bench at Old Trafford, nine years after his final game at the ground. Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",
      "A demoralised Derby conceded again two minutes later, their resolve finally giving way. Obi scored the goal he'd been desperate for, and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the 2,000 fans.",
      "There were chants of 'Rooney, Rooney' when Kai Rooney was brought on from the bench. Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Michael Carrick and Co. will take on Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium as they look to claim another three points after their victory over Manchester City last weekend. And Jenas, speaking on the Wildcards Podcast, believes: “Watching that game against Man City, the first thing I saw was well-drilled, organisation and partnerships were developing",
      "“Up top with Mbeumo and Fernandes, they were linking up loads, obviously got that assist for Mbeumo for the first goal of the game.",
      "“Defensively, the Martinez and Maguire situation looks solid as well. Casemiro in the midfield with Kobbie Mainoo – all of a sudden, there were some partnerships that you looked at and said, ‘Oh, they could be tough to play against’.",
      "Jenas then continued: “And I think against Arsenal, whenever I watch Arsenal, I don’t feel like they break teams down easily.",
      "“Obviously, they have the set-pieces which helps and Gabriel Jesus might help that situation, but you can’t help but look at it and see United playing counterattacking football.",
      "“And if they do, Mbeumo and Fernandes are great options because of the style of play and the way this game is going to play out.",
      "“If Arsenal don’t sort out the counterattack situation very well, they could get caught out. And I think those players, whether it’s Amad Diallo, Fernandes or Mbeumo, I think they will cause problems.”",

      "United will welcome back Noussair Mazraoui to their matchday squad for the clash against Arsenal, with the defender spotted making the trip to the capital alongside his teammates.",
      "Mazraoui has been unavailable for more than a month for United after featuring for Morocco during their run to the Africa Cup of Nations final and is now back in the squad for the Reds and could feature against Arsenal.",

      "Zirkzee is expected to be unavailable for a couple of weeks, while De Ligt is still recovering from a back injury that has kept him on the sidelines since November.",
      "\"He [De Ligt] had a bit of setback before I arrived, only small, but he was a little bit slower than we had liked,\" Carrick stated on Friday. \"He’s getting closer and hopefully in the next couple of weeks he will be back and around it.\"",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of the season. United have taken the unusual step of announcing five months before the Brazilian's contract was due to expire that he will be leaving the club this summer.",
      "The 33-year-old moved to Old Trafford from Real Madrid in August 2022 for a fee rising to £70million, signing a four-year deal with an option for a further season. But the club have decided against triggering that extension, and the MEN understands the decision was made well before Thursday's announcement as part of their long-term planning.",
      "The MEN also understands that Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option and asked the club to make their plans public in order to \"bring external clarity\" to the situation.",
      "Casemiro, who has scored 21 goals in 146 appearances for United so far, said: \"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life.",
      "\"From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months.",
      "\"We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",
      "The midfielder, who won the Carabao Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup a year later, also said in a separate post on social media: \"Knowing when stages come to an end.",

      "The Brazilian's departure in four months' time is one way in which the club are seeking to remodel their squad, and getting the wages of a star player off the books will help them do that. Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid in 2022 in a deal rising to as much as £70m, scoring 21 times in his 146 games so far from the base of United's midfield.",
      "After helping the squad to a League Cup and FA Cup win, there had been calls to sell the ageing midfielder, but this season has shown that he is still more than capable of being a key man, most recently at the derby win over Manchester City. Posting on his Instagram account, Casemiro said: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "Some fans were quick to give Casemiro his flowers for his stint at the club. Reader Heehee123 says: \"Scored 21 goals and a quite a few of those were very important. Can hold his head high, at least he was one player who always gave his all.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Commenter Antw writes: \"People underestimate how good Casemiro actually is. He’s had a few off games, but when we played Lyon at Old Trafford & miraculously won, Casemiro had a part to play in all of the last 3 goals. He won the penalty, he set up Mainoo & also set up Maguire. Unfortunately his legs are giving up.\"",
      "Chrisssssss says: \"Yeah sad to see him go, but realistically seems like a sensible decision. Always more humble than I imagined.\"",
      "Phillotommo writes: \"Sad to See him go. But the legs have gone. Some great memories, and the passion he has for United is infectious. Pity his teammates haven't got the same work ethic as him. Best of Luck Cas, C'MON UNITED.\"",
      "For others, thoughts are already turning to what comes next for United's midfield. 1968red says: \"Well at least it will free up a few quid for a replacement, but it's been money well spent since we signed him. Wish him all the best and thanks for the memories Cas.\"",
      "Rightwing7 wants to see a similar character come in through the door: \"One of the best, if not the best DM in football history. Unfortunately for us, we got only 30% of the best Casemiro, but he give us 100% of what was left in his tank. Never complaining, 100% professional. Wish we can get a young 'Case', like the one when he was in his prime. All my respect for a fantastic football player, and I wish him well in future.\"",
      "Some would even like to see him remain at United in a different capacity. On our Facebook page, Ng Yoon Fatt says: \"This guy is a fantastic professional. He could be an inspiration to our kids in the academy. Personally, I would want to keep him, of course at the right price.\"",
      "Peter Bowker agrees: \"He should be put on the coaching staff in the academy. He is like Cantona, he commands respect. Been a great football player.\"",

      "The 26-year-old was reintegrated into the first-team squad in October and has made the bench for 13 of the last 15 games in all competitions, but he has been used only once when coming on as an 88th-minute substitute against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "It's been a frustrating year for the Netherlands international, who joined PSV Eindhoven on loan for the second half of last season but returned to his parent club after making 12 appearances, with just six starts.",
      "There has been interest in Malacia from clubs in Italy, Spain and Turkey this month, but it is understood there is no move imminent. The former Feyenoord defender has just five months remaining on his United contract and will be released at the end of the season if a deal isn't done this month, although he is keen to get more games under his belt.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He was the only one of five players placed in Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad' who didn't end up leaving Old Trafford in the summer. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford all secured moves away, either permanently or on loan.",
      "Malacia played 45 minutes for United's Under-21s against Wolves earlier this month, scoring in a 4-1 win. He has proven his fitness since missing 517 days with two serious knee injuries.",

      "The club have been putting off their next big investment in the central ranks for some time now, having put their focus into improving other areas such as the backline and the attacking options.",
      "Now, it's time for the centre of the park. While that seemed likely to be the focus of the recruitment team anyway, that need has been accelerated due to Casemiro's situation.",
      "Man United have confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club this summer at the end of his contract, with the decision made not to trigger the extra year that is included as a clause in his deal.",
      "The Brazilian was one of the last major investments in the midfield, with around £60m spent on securing him from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "While there have been some highlights, it seems United are keen to move on and look at the future beyond the 33-year-old, which puts greater emphasis on their deals in the summer.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at a few potential replacements for Casemiro in the transfer market, and what they could offer the team in the years ahead.",
      "Adam Wharton has already proved he has the skills and qualities to slot into any Premier League squad at present. However, given he is currently wanted by the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool and Spurs, United will face stiff competition in securing his services this summer.",
      "A fee north of £65m could also await any interested parties, given the 21-year-old is already Premier League proven.",
      "While Wharton is thought to be United's main interest at present, it is thought that Elliot Anderson is also being monitored. The 23-year-old has been a shining light in a struggling Nottingham Forest squad this season, but a deal will not come cheap.",
      "That's because the Tricky Trees have reportedly slapped Anderson with a price tag of around £100m.",
      "United pursued Carlos Baleba for the majority of the summer, only to be put off by Brighton's £100m valuation of the 22-year-old. An interest still remains in the midfielder and it will be interesting to see if the Seagulls' stance on letting him leave the south coast changes this summer.",
      "Joao Gomes has excelled with Wolves despite the club staring directly down the barrel of imminent relegation. The MEN reported earlier this week that a loan with an obligation to buy for the 24-year-old would be a most likely move. Wolves reportedly want £40m to let him leave midway through 2025/26.",
      "Like Baleba, United found themselves linked with Real Madrid's Eduardo Camavinga in the summer. The 23-year-old has been a revelation at the Bernabeu, with Arsenal and Liverpool said to be monitoring him. It was reported last month that Los Blancos will listen to offers around the £87m mark."

      "The report takes into account United's miserable 2024/25 season, when they finished 14th in the Premier League and suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final. A total revenue of €793million for the season puts them below domestic rivals Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.",

      "Ruben Amorim steered United to the final of that competition in Bilbao, but even that didn't make up much of the shortfall to being outside of the Champions League at a time when a seat at Europe's top table is more financially rewarding than ever.",

      "Last weekend's win against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge has put them back in fifth, which should be good enough to qualify, although the league table remains congested.",
      "If Carrick can steer United back to the Champions League and they enjoy a good season next year, then it should put them back on track financially as well.",
      "\"One successful season can do it,\" explained Maguire. \"Every match at Old Trafford in the Champions League is worth £8million or £9million in terms of ticket sales, so you've got a minimum of four matches.",
      "\"You get to the quarter-finals, you're probably looking at six or seven, so that's £60million. They'll pick up £70million or £80million in prize money as a minimum if you get that far. That’s £150million, then you get the extra £10million from Adidas and other sponsors will be kicking in as well, so that’s the thick end of an extra £200million and they bounce back to where you would expect them to be.",
      "\"Paradoxically, Manchester United fans, from a financial point of view, should want City and Liverpool to do well in the Champions League because that will cement that fifth place, which could be the difference as far as next season is concerned.\"",

      "A former lower-league player in Portugal, Cruz is one of dozens of full-time scouts to leave United over the past 12 months, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's second round of redundancies including a slimming down of the scouting department.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "More than 80 full-time scouts were employed at that time, but swathes have been made redundant or moved on as director of recruitment Christopher Vivell seeks to overhaul what Ineos felt was an antiquated set-up.",

      "“Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey.”",
      "Cruz joined United in 2007 and as well as scouting first-team players in Portugal and Spain, he would offer valuable insight into Portuguese opponents ahead of European fixtures.

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Another year, another quadruple attempt. You can set your watch by them. Every January, some clever-clogs team will be chasing the quadruple before shamefully ending up with something embarrassing like only the Premier League and Champions League to show for it. Mortifying.",
      "Of course, there’s a good reason that the Full Quad in the world’s only proper football, which is obviously English football, and the four proper trophies available – Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup – has never been done. It is almost impossibly difficult. There is literally no shame in failing to complete it; that you can get past the halfway point of the season with something so impossible still theoretically possible is itself extraordinary.",
      "And Arsenal are right now among the less convoluted quad-chasers. They are top of the Premier League and top of the Champions League. They are current favourites in each of the four competitions. It really might happen. Except: it won’t. Because it never does.",
      "But that thought set us upon another thought: what is the best quadruple that has actually happened? We have, through necessity, allowed all manner of bullsh*t pots into this, but we have limited ourselves to Europe’s top five leagues for our own sanity.",
      "Unfortunately, that does mean no place for Celtic, whose 1966/67 Quintuple contains all the proper ingredients (European Cup, Scottish League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup) as well as a Glasgow Cup which, given the historical if not current nature of Scottish fitba, is at least as good as a League Cup probably. But if we included them, we’d have gone down a long, arduous yet inevitable road that leads directly to Linfield’s 1961/62 Septuple and pure delirious madness. So we haven’t. Soz.",
      "",
      "A Quadruple containing neither European nor domestic league glory? F*** all the way off, you cheeky scamps. You’re trying to pull a fast one here and we’ll not have it. Quadruple? Notruple more like.",
      "",
      "This was Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona at the peak of their powers and an indisputably great side, no doubt about that. They don’t need a Quadruple to prove it. Which is just as well, because this is still firmly in tinpot territory. We’ll give you La Liga, obviously, especially after losing just once all season and still only edging out Real Madrid by three points in an epic tussle. But the rule that any cup containing the word ‘Super’ is bobbins is immutable and in play twice here.",
      "The UEFA and Spanish Super Cups are (or were at the time) both two-team low-wattage affairs (albeit the Spanish version was played over two legs) and not really major titles. The FIFA Club World Cup may have slightly more teams, but we all know that in its historical pre-Trump format it amounted in the end to the old Intercontinental clash between the European and South American champs. Barca started the season with six titles up for grabs, but missed out in the Copa del Rey to Sevilla in the last 16 and to Jose Mourinho’s party-pooping Inter in the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "",
      "It must be quite nice to be able to go “This is the worst Quadruple we’ve ever won”. The inherent implications can only augur well. This is the worst Quadruple Bayern Munich have ever won.",
      "",
      "And this is the second worst. A far better one in 2012/13 opened the Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup doors, gifts that were duly accepted. In accordance with tradition, Guangzhou Evergrande were beaten en route to World Cup glory, while penalties were needed to exact a measure of revenge on Chelsea for the 2012 Champions League final in the UEFA Super Cup. But Bayern were thrashed in the Champions League semi-finals by Real Madrid and sloppily passed up the DFB-Supercup right at the start of the season with a defeat to old rivals Dortmund.",
      "",
      "Don’t hear as much about this as you do the 1999 Treble, do you? Even though four is definitely more than three. Can’t think why this is less venerated. Not every day you beat Gamba Osaka and Quito to land the Club World Cup. Or beat Portsmouth on penalties to win the Community Shield. You can stick That Night in Barcelona up your arse, quite frankly.",
      "",
      "Scores grudging bonus points for the fact they’ve done this particular quadruple four times since replacing Lyon as French football’s dominant force. No arguing with the neatness of that. There’s a very obvious reason it’s not as good as 2024/25’s effort, but three of the four here are at least actual competitions containing multiple matches and more than two entrants.",
      "We also quite enjoy the fact that because PSG weren’t even letting anyone else have a go in the League Cup – winning six of the final seven renewals – it was just abolished altogether. We assume that’s why it was chucked in le bin anyway.",
      "The Trophee des Champions sounds much better than ‘Community Shield’ and less deceptively bombastic than ‘Super Cup’ but amounts to the same thing. It’s just a glorified friendly between league winners and cup winners, and PSG have won loads of the buggers. This is a Quadruple built around a Domestic Treble and therefore not too tinpot, but inevitably loses some points because farmers and no Europe.",
      "",
      "A Proper Domestic Double is a high-quality cornerstone of any respectable Quadruple, and Barcelona tick that box in style here, putting a three-game April wobble behind them to win their last five league games by an absurd aggregate score of 24-0 to pip Real Madrid by a point. Sevilla were beaten in extra-time for Copa del Rey glory, but alas it then goes once more into the realm of the tinpot. Athletic Bilbao offered minimal Supercopa resistance, while Guangzhou Evergrande (it is always Guangzhou Evergrande) and River Plate (it is quite often River Plate) were sorted out with little fuss in the Club World Cup. The Champions League bid came a cropper against eventual finalists and domestic rivals Atletico Madrid in the last eight.",
      "",
      "Yes, another Champions League for Real Madrid. Nice one, Loris Karius is crying. The rest of it: tish and fipsy. Alright, so the Supercopa was against Barcelona, but it was still a fancy two-legged friendly. Al-Jazira and Gremio were dispatched in the Club World Cup and Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup. Real also finished second behind actual Tottenham in their Champions League group stage, and third in La Liga. Utter frauds.",
      "",
      "This is one of our favourite Quadruples. Because it highlights the absolute folly of it all. The whole Quadruple obsession vaguely reminds us of the razor blade wars when Gillette and Wilkinson Sword would constantly set out to one up each other by just adding blade after unnecessary blade. The Mach 3 was definitely enough, guys.",
      "And that brings us to Manchester City’s 2018/19 season, in which their Champions League hopes collided with the unstoppable chaotic banter force of Spurs with inevitable consequences, but they did complete an unprecedented English Domestic Treble. An achievement Sir Alex Ferguson had declared impossible, rightly acknowledging the League Cup is far harder to win than the Champions League. But here’s the thing: nobody cared.",
      "And, sure, a lot of that was because it’s City and people in general still don’t care about City the way they do United or Liverpool or even Arsenal. They still didn’t care all that much when they emulated United’s Proper Treble in 2023. But it wasn’t entirely that. Quadruple obsession had rendered Trebles meh. Ludicrous as that is.",
      "Still, though. Whack in the good ol’ Community Shield, and you have a Quadruple. And with all three proper pots pocketed in a league where that had never happened before or since it remains one of the better ones. And you can’t really blame anyone for coming off second best to Spurs with Fernando Llorente in his pomp, can you?",
      "",
      "Were it not for an extremely careless Copa del Rey quarter-final defeat over two legs to Celta Vigo, this would be challenging for top spot. The league title was snaffled after a typically forthright to and fro with Clasico rivals Barcelona, while a slightly scruffy Champions League group stage featuring three draws on their way to second place behind Dortmund was put right in a dominant march through the knockouts. Classic Real Madrid Champions Leaguing, really. They know their way around a UCL knockout tie better than most, a bother with which Man City are about to collide. Napoli and Bayern were beaten home and away in the last 16 and quarter-finals, while a 2-1 second-leg defeat to Atletico mattered not a jot with a 3-0 lead in the bag from the first. On to the final in Cardiff, and a 4-1 shellacking for Juventus. It is the history of the etc.",
      "Super Cup and Club World Cup formalities were also completed along the way, although extra time was required against both Sevilla in the former and Kashima Antlers in the latter. The Antlers were only in the tournament at all as J-League champions because Japan were hosts, but defied the odds to make it all the way to extra-time in the final, beating Auckland City, Mamelodi Sundowns and most notably Copa Libertadores champions Atletico Nacional (thanks in part to the first penalty ever awarded by VAR) along the way.",
      "",
      "We’re going to go right ahead and say it: winning the Champions League is better than winning the French Coupe de la Ligue. Let it never be said we are afraid of molten takes here.",
      "PSG seemed pretty happy, all in all, with a season that finally delivered that long-awaited first Big Cup success alongside a customary sprinkling of domestic baubles. But we’re still pretty annoyed that the abolition of the French League Cup meant no Proper Quad was achieved. On the flipside we are, in truth, relieved at their failure to win the summer’s Club World Cup because then we’d have had to decide which, if any, season it belonged to and we can’t be remotely arsed with that noise.",
      "But within the definite confines of the actual 24/25 season, the entire absence of the Coupe de la Ligue does leave this as a largely unimprovable effort with the domestic double at its core and the big European prize to go with the more tinpot Trophee des Champions.",
      "Of course, this season could set new benchmarks despite Coupe de France embarrassment. Having already won all three of the Glorified Friendlies available to them post-quad – Trophee des Champions, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Intercontinental Cup – and with a live interest retained in both Ligue 1 and Champions League there is a tinpot quintuple very much up for grabs.",
      "",
      "There is no Carabao equivalent in Germany, so this does have to go down as a largely unimprovable effort for Bayern, for whom a Quadruple featuring no tinpottery whatsoever is thus impossible. Won all three major pots in some style, breaking all manner of records on their way to a ludicrous 25-point victory margin in the Bundesliga and winning their six DFB-Pokal games by a combined aggregate of 20-2. Arsenal gave them an almighty scare in the Champions League last 16, winning 2-0 in Munich after a 3-1 Bayern win at the Emirates appeared to have put the tie to bed three weeks earlier. Sauntered past supposed European superpowers Juventus and Barcelona by scoring 11 goals and conceding none before outlasting Jurgen Klopp’s Dortmund at Wembley to take the Big Cup.",
      "We don’t want to get into the hypothetical, but it does seem pretty reasonable to assume this team that lost just once to a German side (2-1 to Bayer Leverkusen in October) all season long may well have won a German League Cup were there such a thing to be won.",

      "When the opening weekend of a Premier League season rolls around, there will always be excitable knee-jerk reactions to the first round of games.",
      "Teams and their players are often rashly written off after a disappointing start or hyped as the real deal, though these early assessments do not always reflect how the season pans out.",
      "This was particularly the case with Arsenal’s unconvincing 1-0 away win against Ruben Amorim’s supposedly resurgent Manchester United side at Old Trafford in August.",
      "At the time, there were the same old fears about Arsenal being held back by Mikel Arteta’s defensive mindset. Meanwhile, despite losing, Man Utd were widely praised for their positive performance that was tipped to indicate a much-improved season under Amorim.",
      "This has since been proven wrong on both counts, with Sunday’s reverse fixture pitting runaway Premier League leaders Arsenal against a Man Utd side with renewed optimism under a new interim head coach after Amorim ultimately failed to turn things around.",
      "So, ahead of Sunday’s match at the Emirates, we have revisited Matt Stead’s conclusions from the August fixture (he was right to be pessimistic about Man Utd) and detail ten main takeaways that have since been debunked and/or proven…",
      "",
      "‘Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.’",
      "Credit to Stead for shoehorning a great Vicar of Dibley bit into his dissection of one of Man Utd’s many false dawns, with good performances against top sides before losses against your Grimsby Towns, Brentfords and Evertons a hallmark of Amorim’s reign and other managers before him.",
      "We don’t need to go into what followed the Arsenal defeat right here, but those who naively felt Man Utd had turned a corner here were badly wrong, with this club now renowned for delivering letdown after letdown.",
      "Michael Carrick’s side will probably replicate the levels reached against Man City when they face Arsenal, but don’t be shocked if/when they lose against Fulham in their next game.",

      "Arsenal were far from convincing in their 2025/26 opener, but their unrelenting reliability and defensive resiliance has given them a huge advantage over their title rivals, especially considering there’s been a significant drop off from Manchester City and Liverpool.",

      "Arsenal are top of the Premier League, top of the Champions League, have one proverbial foot in the Carabao Cup final and are bookies’ favourites for the FA Cup.",
      "In other words, this is currently one of the more credible bids at the Proper Quadruple we’ve yet seen. Any talk at this time of the season is always, by definition, premature simply because actually winning the quadruple is vanishingly unlikely even when everything is going as swimmingly as it currently is for the Gunners.",
      "And if you don’t believe us about how small and twatty the banana skins upon which previous quadruple tilts have slipped, just have a look at this tale of hubris and despair and teams who ended up only winning two or three trophies like massive f*cking losers.",
      "",
      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Won\nChampions League: Won\nLeague Cup: Quarter-finals",
      "A philosophical question for you: if a quadruple bid ends before anyone even actually realises it’s started, does it make a sound? Clearly, nobody was talking about a quadruple – or even a treble for that matter – when Manchester United travelled to White Hart Lane in December 1998 for a League Cup quarter-final against Spurs. They were third in the league, five points behind leaders Aston Villa, hadn’t started their FA Cup campaign and were not yet certain of qualification from a Champions League Group of Death alongside Bayern Munich and Barcelona.",
      "But given everything that happened across the rest of that season, and while acknowledging that the Butterfly Effect applies to quickfire Chris Armstrong doubles after half-time every bit as much as it does to the flapping wings of world-destroying insects, you could make a decent case that this is still actually the closest anyone has ever come and they didn’t even know it.",
      "Sure, maybe the distraction of a two-legged semi-final against Wimbledon and a final against Leicester might have derailed United’s loftier ambitions but also: probably it wouldn’t. And given that even a phenomenally mediocre Spurs team managed to negotiate those games and actually win themselves a trophy (arguably a more notable thing than United’s Treble) you’d have to imagine an all-conquering United would also have done so; they didn’t lose a single game from December 19 onwards in that fabled campaign.",
      "Essentially it boils down to this: all else being equal, United only needed to see off teams who finished the season 11th, 16th and 10th to add a final (but also first) coat of shiny gloss to their greatest ever season. But David Ginola yet again had other ideas.",

If you take an unbeaten league season as the baseline, then ending up with only one trophy isn’t great is it? You know, relatively speaking.",
      "All three cups were distinctly winnable as well. Middlesbrough were Arsenal’s destroyers back then, beating the so-called ‘Invincibles’ home and away in the League Cup semi-final and then going on to defeat Bolton at the Millennium Stadium. Arsenal should definitely have won that one, really.",

Wayne Bridge’s 87th-minute goal secured victory for Chelsea at Highbury in a wide-open tournament that ended with Jose Mourinho and Porto beating Monaco in the final.",

      "City roared back; with barely 20 minutes on the clock the scoreline was an absurd 3-2 to City on the night with Spurs now narrowly ahead in the tie by virtue of those away goals.",
      "When Sergio Aguero scored on the hour, City appeared to have done enough. Only for Fernando Llorente to scramble home a highly controversial third Spurs goal to restore their away-goal advantage. City thought they had won it again in stoppage time only for an agonisingly long VAR check to eventually spot an offside in the build-up.",
      "Reading all that back, it is truly incredible to think that wasn’t even Spurs’ maddest away night of a Champions League run so unutterably bonkers that UEFA had no choice but to scrap the away goals rule altogether in direct response.

Then again, what is a trophy-hoarding machine supposed to do when encountering a relegation-bound team and one of the worst managers in Premier League history?

      "Somehow – to this day nobody really knows how – Liverpool emerged with a 1-0 win from a fearful battering in Paris but then lost by the same scoreline at Anfield before going out on penalties. It was as close as anyone came to halting PSG’s march in the knockout stages as Aston Villa, Arsenal and then most emphatically Inter were all dispatched.

Bogarde and Hemmings are very useful defensive mids, but both are young enough to think the Makelele Role is a Frederick Forsyth novel (obviously Frederick Forsyth novels are massive with Gen Z). Tielemans, Son of Unai, is more than happy trying to do too much a la Bruno Fernandes/Victoria Beckham, but if he gets injured we are proper screwed. So the midfield is *stretched*.",

      "",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games. Could do little to stop either of Sunderland’s goals.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves before a very creditable clean sheet at Villa.",
      "",
      "Burnley are in the mire but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 22 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo. And dropped a bollock against Everton.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad. Little he could do in the face of Carrick-ball.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal. A first clean sheet in five against Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4. And flapping at the corner that led to West Ham’s winner was a dreadful look.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and had very little to do against Palace and Wolves either side of a madness against Leeds.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so but Big John fluffed his big chance.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save at Fulham and only one against Burnley from his own defender.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri was back in. Briefly, as it turned out. Darlow took the gloves again for a serene outing against Fulham.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Unsurprisingly dropped when Fulham came to Elland Road.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save. Newcastle gave him little more to do.",

      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson has struggled to “make a case” for Man Utd beating the Gunners this weekend despite the Red Devils impressive win over Man City.",
      "Man Utd got off to the perfect start under interim boss Michael Carrick last Saturday as they beat arch-rivals Man City 2-0 in a match they could have won by more.",
      "The Red Devils moved up to fifth in the Premier League but remain 15 points behind Arsenal, who are the current leaders, with Mikel Arteta’s side seven points ahead of nearest rivals Man City and Aston Villa.",
      "Man Utd travel to the Emirates Stadium over the weekend in a much different test with Arsenal losing just two matches all season, both away from home.",
      "And Merson is expecting a very comfortable victory for Arsenal despite Carrick’s impressive victory over City in his first fixture.",
      "Merson told Sportskeeda: “It absolutely shocks me to death when people say this is now a massively different game after Manchester United beat City last weekend. In all honesty, I’d be surprised if Arsenal don’t win this.",
      "READ: Paul Scholes should ‘f**king grow up’ as shock four-man Manchester United midfielder shortlist ‘revealed’",
      "“Arsenal won 3-1 away from home to one of the best teams in Italy in midweek. They went to Chelsea and scored three in the EFL cup not long ago. So I don’t buy the claim that facing Manchester United at home is ‘difficult’ for Arsenal.",
      "“Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Jesus scoring against Inter is great news for Arsenal. I think Gyokeres needs to come off the bench in the next few games. When the defenders are tired, the game will open up for him and he can make an impact. So it’s better if he comes on for the final 20 minutes.",
      "“I can’t seem to make a case for Manchester United even after their win over City. Don’t get me wrong, they played well in that game. But Arsenal are just superior. Manchester United win one game and people say they can trouble Arsenal? I don’t get that one bit!",
      "“If you told me I had to bet on one team to win this weekend, I’d actually go Arsenal. Everything points to a win for Mikel Arteta’s men here. They are just so good at home. 29 points from 11 games at the Emirates. Even when they looked so bad against Liverpool, they did not lose.",
      "“Manchester United beat City because they were able to outrun their rivals. They won’t be able to do that against Arsenal.",
      "“Prediction: Arsenal 3-0 Manchester United.”",
      "But Michael Owen insists he fancies Man Utd against Arsenal at the weekend as the Red Devils are suited to playing against the better teams in the Premier League.",
      "Owen told Premier League Productions: “Now they’re going to go to Arsenal and it’s going to be pretty similar.",
      "“They’re going to be out of possession for a lot of the time. They’re going to be sitting deep.",
      "“Suits their back four’s back form massively and they’re going to have pace on the attack.”",
      "Owen added: “So, actually, this game, I actually fancy Manchester United at the moment against the better teams.",
      "“I think they really suit sucking up pressure and hitting with pace on the attack.",
      "“Now, over time, they’re going to have to develop and beat the lesser teams, let’s say, in the league.",
      "“But I don’t think they’re going to be scared of going to Arsenal and sitting back and playing to their strengths like they did at the weekend.”",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson insists that Cole Palmer will be sold by Chelsea if another club puts in a bid of £120m or more in the summer.",
      "Michael Owen believes Arsenal should get rid of ‘flat track bully’ Viktor Gyokeres as he lacks the ‘class’ needed to be a top level Premier League player.",
      "Liverpool midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai has issued a warning to Premier League leaders Arsenal ahead of Thursday’s match between the two sides.",
      "Amorim’s departure looked to be a quick one but Michael Owen bellies there was always doubts behind the scenes.",
      "With Gareth Southgate again linked to the Manchester United job, Michael Owen has warned it may not be a popular move amongst fans.",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson insists that Viktor Gyokeres could still be the reason that the Gunners don’t win the Premier League title."

      "We could (quite fairly) be accused of erring on the side of negativity here at Football365. We revel in the rubbish and are often guilty of failing to bask in the brilliance we see on a regular basis in the Premier League.",
      "We’ve selected the most overrated players, the very worst player at each club and enjoy calling out big-money signings for an entirely reasonable struggle to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "But sometimes it’s nice to be nice, and so here are the revelations of the season, the players who have surprised us with their excellence – one per club.",
      "",
      "He must have been cursing his misfortune upon his arrival last season when Myles Lewis-Skelly enjoyed one of the most stratospheric rises to prominence in recent memory, to such a degree that Calafiori was linked with an exit in the summer, 12 months on from his arrival for £42m.",
      "But he’s made the left-back position in his own in the Premier League this term, combining near faultless defensive displays with no small amount of attacking threat. Being a big lad certainly hasn’t hurt him in his successful usurping of the academy star.",
      "",
      "An honourable mention for the Lazarus of the West Midlands, Matty Cash, who we thought was finished but has played nearly every minute under Unai Emery this term, scoring in the victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. But the new level Rogers has found this season gives him the edge; his knuckleball deserves its own section.",
      "Jude Bellingham or Rogers for England? Could genuinely be a toss-up.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ graded by football analysis experts Gradient Sports",
      "Seven Premier League goals in 646 minutes for the teenager, who’s got the best minutes per goal rate (92.3) of any player in the top flight this season, with Erling Haaland (95) second. The ‘New Kylian Mbappe’ tag doesn’t seem quite so silly now.",
      "",
      "Sixteen goals is at least 14 more goals than we expected from the £30m summer signing who scored 18 in what must actually be The Best League In The World for Club Brugge in 2023/24.",
      "",
      "His ability to thread passes through opposition teams is arguably unmatched in the Premier League and he also loves a battle with a centre-forward, as Haaland found out earlier this month. Quite weird that there’s not more interest in his service from the Big Six vultures. Surely only a matter of time.",
      "",
      "Eight goals in the Championship last season, Anthony’s already got five in the Premier League, including home and away against Manchester United and at the Etihad vs Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Him being fit is a revelation in itself but the way in which he’s developed as a central midfielder has also been remarkable. That move from right-back – which we questioned like many others – may end up being Enzo Maresca’s most crucial and enduring Chelsea legacy. His performance against Arsenal in that role was extraordinary.",
      "",
      "His level has dropped along with the rest of his teammates of late, but the 29-year-old put in several hugely impressive all-round displays when it was still worth getting up in the morning at Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Few would have predicted Garner as Xavi Simons’ answer to a question about which Premier League player has surprised him most – “technical with the ball, he’s really, really good” – or that midway through the season we would be seeing a (bit of a) clamour for him to be called up by Thomas Tuchel for England amid questions as to whether Manchester United should re-sign him as an answer to the midfield conundrum.",
      "",
      "Surely the biggest Premier League revelation of all with his eight goals and five assists for Fulham. And he so very nearly made a deadline-day move to Leeds – a private jet was pre-emptively booked before talks broke down.",
      "",
      "Nine Premier League goals, eight of which have come in a run of nine games after Daniel Farke changed formation to stick another striker up top with him. The England clamour is real.",
      "",
      "Slim picking it’s fair to say but 12 goals in all competitions is a decent return for a striker most of us assumed wouldn’t get much of a look in this season.",
      "",
      "We assumed he was destined to be one of those ten-a-penny wingers who get close to the top by being very, very quick but not quite having it in the top two inches, but he’s developed his game to the point where he doesn’t just look like he could and should make the difference but actually does.",
      "",
      "There’s life in the old dog yet as this particular old dog is evidently desperate to represent his country at the World Cup, before seeing out his days lying balls-up on the sofa, only rising from his slumber for meals and to curl the occasional one out in the back garden, probably in Saudi Arabia.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe described Kieran Trippier’s “spontaneous” decision to hand Miley the armband for the final few minutes of their clash with PSV on Wednesday as “poignant” and also quite possibly a sign of what’s to come, dubbing the 19-year-old a “potential future captain of the football club”.",
      "There was a time – maybe even only a few weeks ago – when an injury to Bruno Guimaraes would have been an utter disaster for Newcastle. But the outstanding versatility and quality shown by Miley this season makes his absence feel manageable at the very least.",
      "",
      "You pal down the pub claiming they always knew Anderson would emerge as the answer to that age-old England problem is almost certainly telling porky pies. His Transfermarkt valuation has nearly doubled from £28m to £52m this season and that’s likely around half of what Manchester City will pay for his services after he conducts England to World Cup glory in the summer.",
      "",
      "There are few things we like more than a Premier League giant selling an academy star to a lower-league team before they return to the top flight to rub the mistake in their face. It’s a shame for us vengeance seekers that Ballard’s boyhood club Arsenal might be the only Premier League side he wouldn’t start for based on his outstanding form this season.",
      "",
      "He does next-to-nothing to help his side keep hold of the ball or get up the pitch, which is entirely as expected, but has also scored seven Premier League goals when we assumed he would be fortunate to score any as a bit-part player before escaping in January.",
      "",
      "We liked what we saw of him for Southampton last season, but it takes quite some mental fortitude not to crumble in this West Ham team, playing in that stadium, in front of those fans. Two relegations in two seasons won’t feel great, but Real Madrid interest in triggering his not-so-secret £20m release clause will.",
      "",
      "The only positive Wolves can take away from this season and the fans will if anything not want him to display too much more of his burgeoning talent for the rest of the campaign, lest he be pinched by a club set to still be playing Premier League football next term.",
      "Pundit Danny Murphy has explained why he thinks only one team is capable of stopping Arsenal winning the Champions League this season.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid have issued an ‘ultimatum’ to Vinicius Junior, while president Florentino Perez ‘wants’ to sign a Manchester City star.",
      "Emiliano Buendia struck a huge blow for Aston Villa and granted us all a genuine title race as Unai Emery’s side exposed Arsenal and two Gunners in particular.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves insists Premier League leaders Arsenal have the “four best full-backs in the country”.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly already decided whether they will enter the market for a new signing in January after suffering a ‘shattering injury blow’.",
      "We’re ruling Liverpool out of the title race after that abject defeat at Man City, who are definitely not out of it after cutting Arsenal’s lead to four."

      "After Darren Fletcher had taken the next two matches, Man Utd appointed Carrick as their interim boss until the end of the campaign.",

      "The Red Devils will decide on a permanent replacement for Amorim at the end of the season with numerous managers linked to the job in the summer.",

      "Ornstein revealed in conversation with Duncan Castles on The Transfers Podcast: “Carrick will naturally enter the conversation depending on how well he does. But I don’t think this is binary, as it was with Ole Gunner Solskjaer. United should run their process properly: speak to available coaches, assess those in work where permitted, look at data, styles and profiles.",
      "“Last time, it came down to Thomas Tuchel and Erik ten Hag. Others like Frank and Pochettino were considered. There are weeks and months now to do that work. Carrick could play himself into contention, or he might decide it’s not the right moment.",
      "“There’s nothing firm right now. It’s hypothetical. But given his qualities, what he showed in his brief United spell before, and his work at Middlesbrough, there’s no reason he shouldn’t at least be in the conversation – much like Kieran McKenna was previously.",
      "“Carrick could be in the mix, but that doesn’t mean he’ll get the job. It’s very much a case of wait and see how it unfolds.”",
      "And Ornstein thinks Carrick ticks one crucial box for the Man Utd hierarchy as they look to bring in the right man to succeed Amorim in the summer.",
      "Ornstein added: “I also understand why United went for a figure with a connection to the club. Lifting spirits, restoring smiles and confidence matters, even if it sounds trite. It’s not everything, but it helps.",

      "As a Man United fan, 4-4-2 raised me. Two proper strikers (even though early Rooney and Ronaldo as mutated 10s and 9s still give me chills). Wingers who actually crossed and celebrated acrobatically after goals. Fullbacks who knew their only job was ‘run and vibes’. This formation won leagues, broke Arsenal (a fave past time), and made defenders fear actual human beings instead of inverted zombies.",

      "Even Sir Alex Ferguson saw 4-4-2 and thought ‘ah yes, free central zones’. If it were used today, Bruno would be doing three people’s jobs, Sesko would be isolated, and Casemiro would look like he was guarding Tesco’s parking lot by himself.",

      "In my view, much has been made of Arsenal’s reliance on set pieces this season, as evidence of a limited / pragmatic / neanderthal approach (take your pick). I think this misunderstands both the cause and the context.",
      "For the last decade and a half, elite football was dominated by positional, ball-heavy systems (70% possession, extreme technical prowess, territory control, cut-backs from the edge of the box) perfected by Guardiola’s genius. The natural response to that dominance for teams with lesser (but not insignificant) resources was resistance: better-coached mid-blocks, aggressive man-marking, and sophisticated rest-defence structures, especially among mid-table PL sides (who, remember, have more money and thus better players – not comparable to the best teams tactically, but fit for purpose of the type of game they planned to play).",
      "In other words, the league got better at stopping positional football.",
      "That tactical shift reduced open-play volume for everyone, including Arsenal (remember the fluent team of 22-23). Set pieces, IMO, are not the cause of this evolution but a rational response to it. Arsenal and a few others (notably Chelsea) have leaned into them because they are one of the few remaining repeatable advantages against compact, well-drilled defences.",
      "Arteta’s use of set pieces, to me, looks less like dogma and more like a stopgap i.e. an efficient (if not aesthetic) solution while the next attacking evolution is being worked out. Guardiola, interestingly, has not yet leaned into that lever to the same extent. His old road’s rapidly agin’, but if anyone can come up with an elegant solution, it’s him.",
      "The broader point is this: set-piece dominance is not evidence of regression. It is evidence of adaptation in a league where defensive organisation has finally caught up with positional purity (and I would say bettered it). A more elegant attacking solution will emerge. It always does. But dismissing the current phase as ‘set-piece FC’ misses the tactical story entirely.",

The point of using Dynasty as a term was not that it was a direct alternative to ‘DNA’ but because DNA is being used so ephemerally, with no concrete concepts other than attacking and exciting (which any team could say they want and have had iterations of their team that have done that before), but that Dynasty implies a one-time event.  It doesn’t flow over to a later version of the team 10, 20 or more years later. Whether we like ‘Americanisations’ or not, it better reflects what happens for teams that dominate an era than DNA. Especially when it is trotted out, again, after one win. My other point was that the confidence that oozed through a team of round pegs in round holes was far more instrumental in the win than DNA.",

      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick is relishing the opportunity for his side to prove themselves against league leaders Arsenal after a dream start at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick, who is in interim charge of United until the end of the season, got off to a winning start as he led his side to a 2-0 derby day win at Old Trafford. It was a performance that earned plaudits for a dominant attacking display.",
      "The former United midfielder is preparing his side for another test against an Arsenal side that are in the driving seat to end a 22-year wait for a Premier League title.",
      "United travel to the Emirates, where the Gunners haven't lost a single game at the Emirates this season, searching for a first Premier League win at Arsenal since 2017.",
      "However, Carrick may take some added confidence given the fact that when he last took on Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, the 44-year-old guided United to a 3-2 victory in 2021, while in caretaker charge.",
      "\"I think Mikel's done a really good job assembling a team that can do so many things well. That in itself is a challenge.",
      "\"The wide men are dangerous one-vs-one. They fill the box and they get a good balance within the team, how they attack, how they defend.",
      "\"They're all a team and they all play their part. It's not necessarily one individual who carries them. Again, from a coaching point of view, credit to Mikel for that.",
      "\"Set plays, they're a threat as well. That's why they're sitting at the top of the league and that's why they're doing so well at the moment in the Champions League.",
      "\"The feeling we've taken over the last week or two in the game and the training, The boys feel in a good place and are looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It's a challenge, we know that, but we can go there and we can face it head-on. We've got good players and we're a good team as well, so we've just proved that. We need to keep proving it as we go.\"",
      "Recalling the win over Arteta's Arsenal in 2021, Carrick added: \"There's not much to take from that moving into this one. It's a whole new challenge, a whole new game, a whole new group of players. More feeding off what we've done this week, going into the game and looking forward to it.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta expects Manchester United to bring \"intensity\" and \"new ideas\" under Carrick as Arsenal aim to get back to winning ways following goalless draws against Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Arsenal boss is especially wary of their counter-attacking threat having watched them ruthlessly punish Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in last weekend's Manchester derby.",
      "\"Michael coming in will bring new ideas,\" he said. \"Always, the intensity rises up.",
      "\"You could see that in the Manchester derby, the kind of behaviours and the game that they played, so we will expect a really tough match and we'll adapt to that for sure.",
      "\"But we are at home and we know how important that game is for us.",
      "\"They are so good in a lot of departments, but it is clear that when that team has a space to go in a certain place to activate or run, they become lethal.",
      "\"You saw that a few days ago in Manchester. They have a lot of attributes to cause you problems. But as well, like every team, they have their weaknesses as well.",
      "\"Historically, there has always been something very linked to that,\" he added of their counter-attacking threat. \"And the profile of players that they always have and certain individuals that are so good at activating those spaces as well.",
      "\"I don't know the stats exactly, but for sure, they are one of the best.\"",
      "Arteta also recalled his meetings with Carrick as a player. \"One of my favourite No 6s,\" he said. \"Very intelligent, looked like he could never break sweat, he was so in control of the games.\"",
      "Of their previous meeting as coaches, Arsenal's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford in December 2021, Arteta added: \"Not great memories, so we have to change them.\"",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United in the summer. His estimated cost to the club £119m. The Athletic asks whether he was worth it",
      "By Mark Critchley, The Athletic",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 18:41, UK",
      "Spending at least £60m in transfer fees on a 30-year-old, giving him a salary of up to £350,000-per-week, and signing him to a four-year contract with the option of a further 12 months would not typically be viewed as cost-effective business.",
      "That is at least partly why Manchester United will not be triggering said option in Casemiro's contract. His Old Trafford career will instead come to an end this summer, as had long been expected.",
      "Once he says goodbye, after adding to his 146 appearances, many will hold up Casemiro's time in Manchester as another symbol of United's waste and extravagance in the transfer market, and a starry-eyed infatuation with big-name, big-money players who arrive well past their peak.",
      "There is undoubtedly some truth to that, but even if he may not have been a particularly smart signing, Casemiro was arguably a necessary one. And though four seasons of a five-time Champions League winner was never going to come cheap, it would also be unfair to dismiss him as a costly mistake.",
      "If anything, the cost was a symptom of United's desperation and dysfunction during Erik ten Hag's tumultuous first summer in charge, with his signing from Real Madrid being quickly accelerated after back-to-back defeats in their opening Premier League games.",
      "The long, protracted and painful pursuit of Frenkie de Jong had run aground by that point. Champions League qualification needed to be delivered at all costs.",
      "Ultimately, it was, thanks in no small part to Casemiro. For that first year in Manchester, certainly for the first six months of his Old Trafford career, he was considered a transformative addition.",
      "The arrival of one of the best No 6s of his generation finally addressed a longstanding problem at the base of midfield. Even if his age meant he was not going to be a long-term solution, his quality and experience meant he was a quick, effective fix.",
      "At his best for United, around the time of the Carabao Cup final victory over Newcastle United that February, he was being uncontroversially hailed in some quarters as the club's most important signing since Eric Cantona.",
      "Casemiro's second season was much more of a struggle, though, and has coloured perceptions of his United career away from Old Trafford. On several occasions, he no longer looked capable of keeping up with the pace of the Premier League, and those stuck in the craw.",
      "Though far from the only player to have difficulties meeting the demands of Ten Hag's increasingly helter-skelter style of play, it did him absolutely no favours as a holding midfielder on the wrong side of 30 and exposed the short-termism of his signing.",
      "He didn't, though. And even after being cast to the peripheries by Ten Hag's successor, at one stage finding himself behind a 21-year-old Toby Collyer in the pecking order, his dedication and determination to win back his place led him to practically become an ever-present again. From then on, he was an example Ruben Amorim would constantly tell his other players to follow.",
      "Last week, The Athletic revealed that Casemiro's option would be automatically triggered if he started every remaining game this season. The chances of that were remote. Even if United had been open to another year, even if their shrinking budgets could afford it, injury or suspension would likely have got in the way. But on form alone, it was not such an outlandish prospect.",
      "Casemiro has started 19 of 24 matches in all competitions this season, including all but one of the Premier League games that he has been available for. Despite the justified clamour for Kobbie Mainoo to be given more opportunities, few argued that should come at the 33-year-old's expense.",
      "When part of more compact and conservative tactical setups than Ten Hag's, he has generally looked capable of continuing to play at a high level.",
      "His considerable threat from set pieces has left him with a respectable tally of 21 goals since joining. And though he could be erratic with his passing, there were often nights over the past three and a half years when he looked like the only United player other than Bruno Fernandes capable of creating something.",
      "Thursday's announcement that he will leave at the end of the season followed a man-of-the-match display in the 198th Manchester derby. It was only the latest example that Casemiro still has something to offer United, albeit not on his current pay packet.",
      "Even without the one-year option triggered, a rough estimate puts the minimum cost to United of first signing and then keeping Casemiro for the past four seasons at £119m ($160m). Was it worth it? Opinions will vary.",
      "But here's something more of us can agree on: United have been a better team when Casemiro is playing. This season, especially. And now, he must be replaced.",
      "There is a different set of decision-makers in place at Old Trafford compared to the summer of 2022, and they will surely look for a younger and more athletic midfielder, with a higher ceiling in terms of what they can achieve as a United player, and a higher resale value if they fall short of that mark. A smarter signing, we'll all surely agree.",
      "Like Casemiro, that midfielder - whether it is Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or another target - won't come cheap. And to avoid any sort of drop-off next season, they will need to be as dependable at the base of United's midfield as the man they are replacing has been for most of his eventful Old Trafford career.",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 11:58, UK",
      "On the day when United confirmed that one key midfielder will leave Old Trafford, with the soon-to-be-34-year-old Casemiro departing at the end of this season, it can now be revealed they are keen to tie down another, much younger, midfielder with a vastly improved deal.",
      "It is understood there has been initial contact with Mainoo's representatives, with a plan to sit down and discuss the details of a new and improved contract - one which would see his wages brought more in line with his team-mates and his standing at the club.",
      "Having come through United's academy, Mainoo's salary is among the smallest of all the members of the first-team squad. But with the 20-year-old not part of former head coach Ruben Amorim's plans, and with 18 months remaining on his current deal - plus a further year option - it was not seen as a priority for the club to open fresh talks.",

      "The Mainoo news comes as Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season, ending a four-year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "As SSN previously reported in the autumn, Casemiro is one of the highest earners in the squad and it was unlikely United would renew his contract as the freed up wage capacity will allow more space for future investment/signings in the midfield area.",
      "Casemiro has had a renaissance at the club in the last 12 months. After being out of the team under Ruben Amorim initially, he was praised by Amorim for his willingness to fight for his place and has been a key part of the team since then - he started the Manchester derby under Michael Carrick in his first game as well.",

      "\"It's very interesting because we knew Casemiro's contract was running out this summer.",
      "\"Harry Maguire is also someone to talk about because his contract also runs out this summer. No fresh talks have happened with him, either.",

      "\"They're hoping that all of this capacity freed up can allow for more signings in the future, and with the midfield as a priority, it will mean that they definitely have to now sign someone in the summer.",

      "Gabriel Jesus and Viktor Gyokeres were seen to have given Mikel Arteta a selection dilemma against Manchester United in Arsenal's win over Inter Milan. But what if their goalscoring displays actually proved their suitability to their roles on the night?",
      "Arsenal looked a far more fluid attacking force with Jesus starting up front. The flurry of passes that led to their opening goal was untypical of Mikel Arteta's side this season and included a deft lay-off from Jesus to Mikel Merino before his instinctive finish.",
      "Jesus continued to knit things together, pulling to the flanks to combine with Arsenal's wide players, creating space for Eberechi Eze, feeding team-mates with his back to goal and, at one point, even driving forward with the ball and playing Bukayo Saka through.",
      "His performance, on only his third start this season, was reminiscent of the electrifying displays that followed his arrival from Manchester City in 2022, before the first in a succession of injuries struck.",

      "They are qualities Gyokeres lacks. But by coming into the game as a substitute, when Inter were chasing an equaliser, he was able to show what he can do, attacking space on the break to latch onto Gabriel Martinelli's ball in behind before finishing superbly.",
      "It was a goal Jesus probably wouldn't have scored. Just as the opening goal by Jesus, with the intricate interplay that preceded it, was one Gyokeres probably wouldn't have scored.",
      "The first half of the season has exposed the limitations in Gyokeres's game. But it is also true that the conditions he found for his goal on Tuesday have rarely been available to him in the Premier League, where space is at a premium and compactness reigns.",
      "The moments when opponents become stretched tend to occur late in games, when they are tiring and, often, chasing goals. By that point, Gyokeres, who has started all but three of his 20 Premier League appearances so far, has usually been substituted.",
      "Arteta's hand has been forced, at least to some extent. Injuries to Jesus and Kai Havertz left Gyokeres as his only available striker for much of the season. But the option to change his role is there for the Arsenal manager now and the need for it is clear.",
      "Arsenal have won 13 out of 17 league games with Gyokeres starting but that is largely thanks to a reliance on set-pieces. They have only scored 13 open-play goals in those 17 games compared to 10 in the other five. There is a gap in open-play expected goals too.",
      "It is no coincidence that many of Arsenal's best and most fluent attacking performances this season, against Bayern Munich, Tottenham and now Inter Milan, have come when Arteta has started with either Mikel Merino or Jesus in the No 9 role over Gyokeres.",
      "Like Havertz, they bring more in the role. More touches, more passes, more duel-winning ability and, perhaps most damningly, more goals. Erling Haaland proves low-touch volume is not necessarily an issue for a striker. But only if that striker is scoring.",
      "Gyokeres, without a non-penalty Premier League goal since November 1, is simply not doing that. In his 17 starts up front in the competition, he has a worse shot conversion rate than any of the players with whom he is competing for the No 9 spot at Arsenal.",
      "All of which is not to say Gyokeres cannot be useful to Arteta. It might just require a recalibration of his role.",
      "At £64m, it is safe to assume he was not signed to be a substitute. But it is surely better to use him in the manner in which he can be most effective, as a relentless runner against tiring defences, than wait for him to become something he is not.",
      "Of course, the situation might look different had Havertz been available to share the minutes up front, instead of joining Jesus on the sidelines with a knee injury in August. A lighter workload, and more outings off the bench, might have suited Gyokeres better.",
      "It also would have made life easier for Arteta.",
      "Havertz's finishing has been a source of frustration to Arsenal supporters during his time at the club. But while the signing of Gyokeres was intended to add greater cutting edge, Havertz surely remains their first choice in the position when available.",
      "It is worth noting that at the time of the groin injury that curtailed his season last term, Havertz had scored 15 goals, putting him on track for the highest-scoring campaign of his club career.",
      "Across 31 Premier League starts as a forward for Arsenal overall, he has 24 goal involvements, with 15 goals and nine assists. And that is on top of everything else he brings to the role.",
      "They are hugely impressive numbers which underline the potential significance of a return to fitness which, frustratingly for Arsenal, is taking longer than expected. Havertz was an unused substitute against Nottingham Forest and Inter despite previously making cameos in the wins over Portsmouth and Chelsea.",
      "Jesus, of course, is still only recently returned from injury too.",
      "But if it is a choice between him or Gyokeres against Manchester United, events at the San Siro might have shown the way forward.",
      "The potential absence of Bruno Guimaraes against Aston Villa on Sunday following his injury against PSV Eindhoven is a worry for Newcastle. But in Lewis Miley they do at least have a player ready to step in and deliver whatever is asked of him.",
      "The 19-year-old ensured their captain was not missed in the second half of Wednesday's game. Having displayed maturity and composure in midfield, he ended up at right-back, taking the captain's armband off Kieran Trippier as he went off.",
      "It was a special moment for the academy product, who has been switching between positions all season. Having impressed as a makeshift right-back, he might now be needed back in midfield, where he has already slotted into a variety of different roles.",
      "Will Bryan Mbeumo be used as a No 9 again when Manchester United go to the Emirates Stadium on the back of their win in the Manchester derby? He can cause problems for the team against whom he made his United debut back in August.",
      "The last column made the case for Manchester United's new head coach Michael Carrick to go on the attack against Manchester City, something he did to great effect. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes's return to No 10 and Antoine Semenyo's impact.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "Some bets don't need overcomplicating. You look at the venue, you look at the numbers and the picture becomes clear. Brentford at home is one of those situations and the 10/11 with Sky Bet against Nottingham Forest is very hard to turn down.",
      "The Gtech has quietly become one of the toughest places to go in the Premier League. Brentford have taken 24 points from a possible 33 at home, the fourth-best home record in the division. That's not built on soft fixtures either, it's a repeatable edge driven by structure, intensity and crowd energy.",
      "Brentford are aggressive in duels, strong in second balls and ruthless in moments that matter. They turn games into uncomfortable experiences for visiting teams.",
      "Oliver Glasner's impending departure at the end of the season matters. Even the most professional squads feel it when leadership has an expiry date. Messages lose a fraction of their bite. It doesn't mean Palace will down tools but it does mean focus can blur at the margins and at this level fine margins decide Premier League games.",
      "Chelsea, fresh from their own off-field shake-up, arrive with something Palace lack right now: clarity. No looming exits. No major distractions. Just points to chase and a clear objective under Liam Rosenior to finish in the Champions League places. In matches like this, that mental clarity is an underrated edge and does make Chelsea an interesting betting proposal at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Joelinton and emotional control have always lived on opposite sides of the street. He plays on the edge because Newcastle need him to. Intensity, duels, aggression - it's his job description. And against Aston Villa, that edge has repeatedly tipped into yellow card territory.",
      "Joelinton has been booked in five of the last seven meetings between Newcastle and Villa. That's not a coincidence. Villa bring the kind of technical ball carriers and intelligent movers that force Joelinton into recovery challenges, late tackles and tactical fouls.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins are card magnets. Since the start of last season, that trio have collectively drawn 48 cards from opposition players. They're clever with their movement, sharp on the turn and excellent at inviting contact in dangerous areas.",
      "The 9/4 with Sky Bet for Joelinton to be carded is a serious runner.",
      "Bukayo Saka's current run of 12 games without a goal in all competitions is his joint-longest drought for Arsenal. From a surface view, that type of run would put people off selecting him in the goalscorer markets. But I see it differently. Trends in football always snap. And timing is everything when it comes to snapping them for profit.",
      "Saka is still Arsenal's creative heartbeat, the outlet for danger and the player most likely to exploit half-chances in the final third. Arsenal are likely to control large portions of this game and Saka will be central to creating or finishing chances.",
      "From a betting standpoint, the question isn't whether Saka will score eventually - it's when. This looks the time to jump on at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin facing Everton for the first time in his career is a classic \"ex-factor\" scenario. A player with motivation, familiarity and unfinished business - all variables that can't be factored into his goalscorer prices. Add in his current form and this becomes a very juicy angle for punters. Calvert-Lewin has been in electric mood. Eight goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances underline his finishing sharpness and consistency.",
      "He's leading the line for a Leeds team that have netted 17 goals in their last nine Premier League games - second only to Manchester City (18), which paints a picture of a confident team. You can get 2/1 on Calvert-Lewin finding the net.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 18:29, UK",
      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season upon the expiry of his current deal at Old Trafford.",
      "The announcement of his departure brings an end to a four-year stay at Old Trafford, which has seen him score in a League Cup final victory in 2023 and reach two FA Cup finals, winning the competition in 2024.",
      "Casemiro was also part of the United side that reached the Europa League final in May of last season.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder signed for the club in August 2022 and United had the option to trigger a 12-month extension at the end of the season.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "\"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life,\" Casemiro said in a statement.",
      "\"From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months.",
      "\"We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",
      "\"Leave the football before the football leaves you. The football has left him.\" The words of Jamie Carragher aimed at Casemiro after the Brazilian's disastrous performance in a harrowing 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. Casemiro was all over the place and his legs had gone - as had his confidence.",
      "There was a feeling that the midfielder United had splashed £70m on in 2022 was no longer fit for purpose. Now, as he approaches his Old Trafford swansong, he leaves with his reputation fully intact.",
      "Some eyebrows were raised when a 30-year-old five-time Champions League winner traded the Spanish capital for a spot in Erik ten Hag's Manchester United.",
      "However, a stellar first season that saw United finish third was some justification as a 'quick fix' appeared a stroke of real genius. Naturally on the wane, tougher seasons and poorer performances would follow but his importance would remain a fixture.",
      "Leaning on his experience, Ruben Amorim grew to rely on Casemiro in midfield after initially opting against fielding the veteran. Important goals like the one that helped United end a six-year trophy drought in the form of a Carabao Cup continued as Casemiro would prove clutch across various periods.",
      "Now Michael Carrick, a world-class midfielder himself during his playing career, has also recognised his importance as Casemiro started and impressed in his derby-day bow at Old Trafford.",
      "Success is relative, especially in regards to what Manchester United are now compared to the Real Madrid side Casemiro left. However, like Raphael Varane before him who made the same switch, Casemiro's significance in a side battling through transition will be a point in his career he looks back on fondly.",

      "There is a battle going on for several top strikers across Europe.",
      "Centre-forwards are wanted in every transfer window and always come at a premium, but this month several very good ones are on the market and some big clubs are circling.",
      "But do not rule out other clubs emerging either as it gets closer to the deadline, which is just 11 days away.",
      "Clubs interested: Juventus, Aston Villa",
      "Mateta has told Crystal Palace he wants to leave the club this month. He has wanted to leave since last summer when multiple clubs tried to sign him and he did not agree a new contract with Palace.",
      "The strongest team on him has been Juventus, but they have other options too such as Youssef En Nesyri. Aston Villa are also interested in Mateta but appear to be prioritising Tammy Abraham at Besiktas. Those two are not the only clubs.",
      "However, Crystal Palace are not actively trying to sell Mateta and it would require a significant offer for the club to be tempted to sell.",
      "They still value Mateta around £35m and, as things stand, an exit is not close. In the background is uncertainty around head coach Oliver Glasner and the club are trying to stabilise a rocky point in their season.",
      "So far, Juventus are prepared to pay around £26m (€30m) to sign him in a proposal that would involve an initial loan for £1.7m and then a £24.3m obligation to buy in the summer.",
      "Sky in Italy's Gianluca Di Marzio has reported Palace have rejected an initial offer from Juventus. The Serie A club are willing to offer Mateta a four-year deal too with a significant pay rise.",
      "Palace turned down bids for Mateta from Champions League clubs in the summer and there was also a late enquiry - but no bid - from Tottenham Hotspur before they signed Randal Kolo Muani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain on Deadline Day.",
      "Atalanta, AC Milan and several Premier League clubs were also interested in Mateta in the summer but a move did not happen.",
      "Since Glasner's first Premier League game in charge of Palace in February 2024, only Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah have scored more league goals than Mateta (35).",
      "At 28, he wants to play for a Champions League club or for a club who have a good chance of playing in the competition next season.",
      "He also wants to play for France in the World Cup after he was called up for the first time in October and he scored his first goal away at Iceland. But he faces tough competition for a place in a highly talented squad.",
      "Palace executive chairman Steve Parish is a notoriously tough negotiator, and he has always been reluctant to let any players leave on the cheap. And Palace want to strengthen their squad this month after selling Marc Guehi to Manchester City.",
      "They want to try and win the Conference League and finish as high as possible in the Premier League, keeping Glasner for the rest of his contract in the process.",
      "Club interested: Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa have been stepping up their efforts to sign Tammy Abraham after Villa officials and the player's representatives watched him play for Besiktas in Istanbul on Monday night. The club were in Turkey to play Fenerbahce on Thursday night.",
      "Villa want to strengthen their squad after selling Donyell Malen to Roma on January 16 but money remains tight at the club and they are conscious of ensuring they meet their PSR obligations.",
      "Villa's high wage bill relative to their revenue means they have to be careful when it comes to spending in the transfer market. UEFA fined Villa £9.5m in July last year for breaking their financial rules.",
      "It is believed Besiktas now own Abraham's registration after he met the criteria to join them permanently amid an initial loan deal from Roma - and he is believed to keen to return to Villa, whom he spent time on loan at from Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Abraham spent a hugely successful 2018-19 season on loan at Villa from Chelsea. He scored 26 times to help Villa win promotion back to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Other clubs - in the Premier League and in Europe - are also interested in Abraham this month and Villa now have injury problems in midfield, with John McGinn joining Boubakar Kamara on the sidelines.",
      "Villa have already been in for midfielders this month, missing out on signing Conor Gallagher to Tottenham Hotspur. They are also trying to find a solution for Harvey Elliott, whom they do not want to play any further to avoid having to sign him permanently from Liverpool for £35m.",
      "Clubs interested: Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham",
      "Leeds United are the latest of multiple clubs to make enquiries to Wolves for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "The 25-year-old, who is valued at £40m by the struggling bottom side, is also attracting interest from West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.",
      "Leeds are aware of the competition for Strand Larsen and have to be cautious with PSR in this transfer window. As things stand, they have simply expressed their interest in the player with Wolves.",
      "Departures could help Leeds to make room for incomings, and Jack Harrison has now joined Fiorentina. Joel Piroe could also leave in the next days. However, as things stand Leeds believe he wants to stay and fight for his place and the club will not push him out the door.",
      "Crystal Palace are believed to have made an enquiry too, and that is one to watch considering the growing uncertainty around Mateta's future at the club.",
      "Since their own Strand Larsen enquiry, West Ham have signed two new forwards in Pablo and Taty Castellanos, with Callum Wilson also increasingly likely to stay.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the other club to be keen on Strand Larsen but they appear to be focussing on Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli.",
      "Norway international Strand Larsen was the subject of intense interest from Newcastle in the summer, and since he has scored only three times for struggling Wolves this season, in 13 appearances, his value has depreciate somewhat.",
      "Wolves are weighing up what they can do in the market to make themselves more competitive but also protect the long-term, which may include a period in the Championship.",

      "Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired about Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor.",
      "No concrete approach has been made yet as both clubs are also considering or waiting on other targets, whom are on this list.",
      "The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and he is one to watch with 11 days left of this window.",
      "The 25-year-old's contract is up in 2028 and he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland behind Brian Brobbey and sometimes Eliezer Mayenda.",
      "Isidor has not been in a Premier League squad since New Year's Day and has not started two games in a row since November.",
      "Isidor has scored only four Premier League goals this season, and none since October.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Napoli, Sevilla",

      "The Fenerbahce striker, known to Premier League clubs for some time after his impressive stint at Sevilla in Spain, is firmly on the radar of Nottingham Forest and Everton this month.",
      "There is competition from two Italian giants, however, in Juventus - exploring him as an alternative to Mateta - and Antonio Conte's Napoli, who are preparing to lose Lorenzo Lucca to Forest or elsewhere on loan.",
      "According to Sky in Italy, even former club Sevilla have made an inquiry about getting En Nesyri back to the club.",
      "Aston Villa play against Fenerbahce on Thursday night in the Europa League and although it is not clear how much they like En Nesyri themselves, a match-winning performance for the Turkish club would be hard to ignore if that is what he produces.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Besiktas, Benfica",
      "Nottingham Forest have agreed loan terms with Napoli for Lorenzo Lucca, according to Sky in Italy, but the striker has not given a final decision over his future and discussions continue.",
      "Pisa - his former club - are also interested in Lucca and have offered him a chance to stay in Italy so the situation remains in the balance and down to the player.",
      "Forest are therefore also working on other options, some mentioned above, and also including Evan Ferguson.",
      "Forest have made signing a striker a priority following an injury to Chris Wood and uncertainty over the progress of Arnaud Kalimuendo, who has gone to Germany on loan for his development.",
      "Lucca is a 25-year-old Italy international who is technically on loan at Napoli from Udinese. However, Napoli hold an obligation to buy him and so would execute that obligation before he would be able to move anywhere else.",
      "Therefore, if Forest do indeed loan him, it would be from Napoli and not Udinese.",
      "Club interested: Roma",
      "Roma will begin preparing a proposal for Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They have been waiting in the wings to move for the forward while United had Bryan Mbeumo away at AFCON and the change of head coach at Old Trafford needed time to conclude.",
      "However, against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge, Zirkzee was not even in the matchday squad. It was said he had a minor injury.",
      "A strong Roma advance will almost certainly test the resolve of both player and club if it comes.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Fulham",
      "With Roma aiming to make changes to their forward line, including potentially bringing in Zirkee from United, Evan Ferguson's situation on loan there is in doubt.",
      "Napoli and Forest are keeping an eye on the situation and the decision is down to Roma, with Brighton deputy chair Paul Barber confirming earlier in the window that they do not have the option to recall him.",
      "\"It's very unlikely, I would say (that he returns to Brighton),\" Barber said. \"We don't have that option, so if he were to come back it would be because the club that has him at the moment doesn't need him in the second half of the season.",
      "\"At the moment it seems very unlikely - he's playing well and scoring goals, it's not really one that is in our gift.\"",
      "Fulham have also long looked at Ferguson as a way of strengthening at centre-forward but their priority remains to sign PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi.",
      "If Ferguson's loan is terminated and he arrives back at Brighton, there is expected to be increased interest from other clubs in taking him on loan for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Although Roma are exploring changes, Ferguson has impressed there. He has scored five goals in 21 appearances including two in five games in the Europa League. It has been a positive step in his development so far, playing in Italy.",
      "Callum Wilson (West Ham), Joel Piroe (Leeds), David Datro Fofana (Chelsea/Fatih Karagümrük), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Artem Dovbyk (Roma)"
