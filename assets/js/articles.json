      "Napoli director of sport Giovanni Manna insists the club will be \"ready\" to identify a replacement for Kevin De Bruyne in January, hinting that the Belgian's injury may force them to put previous transfer plans on hold. Summer signing De Bruyne will miss an extended period after deciding to undergo surgery in an effort to solve his injury woes.",
      "Manna indicated the club's initial goal was to improve squad depth, given how hard it was to find upgrades on the title-winning squad. With De Bruyne unavailable, though, the new goal is clear.",
      "“Kevin’s injury is extremely damaging for us, because there are few players with that kind of quality, his start had been good, and he could only have improved,\" Manna told Sky Sport Italia (via Football Italia). \"We are looking around, as is natural and fair, and at the right moment we will be ready.\"",
      "Reflecting on last summer's business, he added: “What we needed was to improve the reserves, because it is honestly not easy to improve upon Lobotka, McTominay, Anguissa, Rrahmani, Buongiorno, Di Lorenzo, Olivera, Lukaku, Politano, Neres or until January Kvaratskhelia.",
      "“We tried to do our best, I think we achieved that in some roles, but with others it will take a little time. What we needed this summer was to bolster the bench. Our transfer strategy for the next session will be very different.”",
      "One of the players linked with a January move to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona is Kobbie Mainoo. The Manchester United academy graduate was a summer target, ultimately staying at Old Trafford, but Antonio Conte's side could renew their interest in the new year.",
      "Mainoo has a chance to join former club colleagues Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund in Naples as he aims to play himself back into England contention before the 2026 World Cup. He started half of United's Premier League games last season but has barely featured in the competition this term, managing just 138 minutes across seven substitute outings.",
      "De Bruyne, who joined Napoli on a free transfer following the expiry of his Manchester City contract, had made a fast start before injury struck. He scored four times in his first Serie A appearances, while a pair of assists against Sporting CP gave Conte's team their first Champions League win of the season.",
      "\"Key players are getting injured, there's been talk of major reinforcements, and meanwhile we've lost [Romelu] Lukaku and now De Bruyne too,\" Conte said after a victory over Lecce at the end of October. \"Some said we benefited from that, and I find that absurd.",
      "\"I remember the headlines about his signing [De Bruyne] for Napoli, which was outpacing their rivals. Now, some dare say [his injury] could be an advantage, it's fantastic: I give up, I've heard all sorts of things. Lukaku has disappeared from the radar, now De Bruyne's absence is an advantage: it's Oscar-worthy.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney may be at risk of a new spat with Cristiano Ronaldo after the latter shared a fresh Lionel Messi verdict which disagrees with the Manchester United icon's own opinion. Ronaldo is still playing football with his third season at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr well underway.",
      "The 40-year-old has grabbed eight goals in this campaign after a brace in Al-Nassr's most-recent victory over Al-Fayha. However, it was a new interview with controversial broadcaster Piers Morgan which got him back in some mainstream headlines.",
      "That was released on Tuesday with a number of topics covered including the Messi or Ronaldo debate with the man himself unsurprisingly clear in his verdict.",
      "\"Is Messi better than me? I disagree. I don't want to be humble,\" Ronaldo said when speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored. Back in September, via the Rio Ferdinand Presents Podcast, Rooney referenced his past comments where he stated Messi was better than Ronaldo, but this time opted to provide a more balanced verdict.",
      "\"People think I hate him [Ronaldo],\" Rooney said. \"I love him. I think he's an absolute genius and what he's doing is incredible.",
      "\"I love Cristiano and playing with him. I don't think people realise actually how close me and him were. I think just because I've said that I think Messi is better than Ronaldo, people think I don't like Cristiano.",
      "\"I absolutely love Messi, love watching him play and that was the only reason because I think Messi had a little bit more in terms of how he played and taking players on and whatever. Ronaldo's a killer - and people think because I have said Messi is better than Ronaldo, I don't like him or speak down on him.",
      "\"This person might prefer Messi or Ronaldo, but no, I don't think you can argue with any of them two. But then I think people think; 'Oh, Wayne said Messi's better than Ronaldo'.",
      "\"I get asked it all the time. I'm like; 'Come on'. The two of the best players ever, well, they are the two, in my opinion, the two best players to have played the game. And I just like the little flair about Messi and that's it.",
      "\"Cristiano is an absolute genius on what he's doing. He's just turned 40. What he's doing is incredible and I take my hat off to him. I couldn't speak a bad word about him.\"",
      "Rooney has also been involved in a much more direct war of words with Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. The latter recently responded to his criticism as \"lazy\", with Rooney providing his own reply to that in the latest edition of The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "\"Van Dijk, similar to Mo Salah over the last five years, has been one of the best in the world,\" he said. \"Last year it was hard to say anything bad because they were that good and he was that. I'm sure he would say he hasn't been at his best this season, if he's honest with himself.",
      "As captain, your job is to call meetings with your teammates and that was really what I was saying, as a leader, I'm sure he will have been doing that and I've got full respect for him.",
      "\"He's a fantastic player, but my job now as a pundit is to give my opinions on what I feel and I'm sure if you ask him or Arne Slot, he probably hasn't been as good as he has been over the last few years and that was my comment.\"",

      "Manchester United have a new potential buyer for Joshua Zirkzee, it has been claimed. The Dutch international has been linked with Sevilla and West Ham United, but AS Roma have now entered the mix.",
      "It isn't the first time Roma have found themselves in contention to hand an Old Trafford escape route to an out-of-favour United star. Jadon Sancho was a target for the Serie A outfit over the summer, only for wage demands to reportedly put paid to the deal, with Sancho eventually joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "According to Sky Sport Switzerland, though, Zirkzee has indicated a willingness to take a pay cut if it allows him to move to the Stadio Olimpico. The same publication also lists AC Milan as a possible destination.",
      "Zirkzee moved to Old Trafford after impressing for Bologna and helping the club qualify for the Champions League under Thiago Motta in 2024. A reunion with Motta at Juventus had been mooted, only for the manager to lose his job in Turin in March.",
      "Roma and Milan are both in the Champions League spots in Serie A after 10 matches, but both could do with a little more firepower. Roma have scored just 10 times in the league, while Milan striker Santi Gimenez missed his team's weekend victory over Roma through injury.",
      "Zirkzee has played just 82 league minutes this season, with the addition of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko limiting his involvement. The bulk of that game time came as a first-half substitute for the injured Cunha during a victory over Burnley in August.",
      "He was an unused substitute on Saturday, even as United chased an equaliser against Nottingham Forest. Defenders Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui were introduced in Amorim's only changes of the afternoon, with a volley from Amad rescuing a late point.",
      "A January move appears to represent Zirkzee's best chance of making the Netherlands squad for the 2026 World Cup - if the Oranje get the results they need in November to make sure of their place. He was part of the Euro 2024 squad and played four UEFA Nations League matches in 2024 but has not featured for his national team since starting against Bosnia and Herzegovina nearly a full year ago.",

      "The latest edition of Sports Interactive's global phenomenon finally dropped on Tuesday after months of anticipation. Enthusiasts have been kept waiting after last year's title failed to launch, meaning it's been two years since the last FM hit shelves.",
      "That may be for the best from a United perspective given the club's struggles over the past 12 months or so. However, a new game offers new possibilities, and a new forward line at Old Trafford also means fresh finishers worthy of attention.",
      "Despite a flurry of summer signings, however, it's midfielder and Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes who's the joint-best finisher among their ranks. The Portuguese playmaker boasts an impress finishing score of 15, level with the exiled Marcus Rashford, who is spending the season on loan at Barcelona.",
      "And Rashford also resides at the top of the list in terms of United's paciest players. A speed score of 17 puts him level with another player who's not even at Old Trafford this term, Rasmus Hojlund, who is thriving on loan at Napoli.",
      "With Rashford and Hojlund away on loan, the fastest player left at United is defender Patrick Dorgu, who has 16 pace for this year's edition of FM.",

And now in a fresh interview with the broadcaster, the Portugal international gave another detailed take on the issues at United and explained why he believes his old club continue to struggle.",

Former boss Gary O'Neil, who was sacked by Wolves in December 2024, ruled himself out of making a return on Monday after having talks with the club.",

      "Gary Neville has called out Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes - telling them they should be doing more for Manchester United. All four players have featured heavily in recent weeks as United turned their fortunes around.",
      "The Red Devils kicked off October with Ruben Amorim under huge pressure following a poor start to the season. But a 2-2 draw against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Saturday afternoon extended United’s unbeaten run in the Premier League to four games.",
      "But a change in fortunes hasn’t stopped Neville from telling United’s ageing spine that they should be performing far better than they currently are. Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket show, he said: “I think your spine of a football team is critical.",
      "“When I first came into Man United, our spine was Schmeichel, Bruce, Pallister, Keane and Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "“We literally were able to be cushioned by this unbelievably strong spine that delivered reliably every single week.",
      "“I think Maguire and De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You know, you look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "“De Ligt's played a mountain of games at sort of different levels, the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England.",
      "“You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno have got massive experience. Up front, they haven't got the experience.",
      "“But to me, that spine of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "“That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got MacAllister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.”",
      "Neville spent all of his career at Old Trafford, making 602 appearances for the club, 400 of which came in the Premier League. He won every major honour on offer and admits Roy Keane is the most influential footballer he has ever come across.",
      "He said: “I think people see the real Roy Keane on Stick To Football, which is more of the real him.",
      "“He's a compelling storyteller, funny, loyal, great morals, family man, everything that you would want, but fiercely competitive.",
      "“For me, he was the Sir Alex on the pitch. If you've got the coach that's basically unbelievable, you still need a player on the pitch that's going to replicate that.",
      "“Think about how important you were as a captain on the pitch. You're massively influential on the game and he was massively influential to us.",
      "“I mean, without him, I always used think without him, we were half the team. He was that important. He's most influential football player I've ever seen.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "England icon David Beckham has finally been handed his knighthood after a lengthy wait. The former Three Lions captain was confirmed as a knight of the realm earlier this year after being included in King Charles ’ Birthday Honours.",
      "His award was confirmed due to his services to sport and charity. A statement from Beckham at the time read: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour.",
      "“To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true. Off the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation.",
      "“I’m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I’m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment. It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I’m immensely proud and it’s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.”",
      "Following a near five-month wait, Beckham was finally handed his honour in a ceremony alongside the King. The 50-year-old was one of a number of familiar faces to receive awards.",
      "Rugby League icon Billy Boston was also knighted, while Alistair Brownlee, Deta Hedman and Devon Malcolm were awarded OBE’s in King Charles’ Birthday Honours.",
      "Beckham commenced his footballing career with Manchester United in 1992 and he went on to make 394 appearances for the club ahead of a move to Real Madrid. He went on to play for LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Beckham also made 115 appearances for England, captaining the Three Lions on a host of occasions. Following his retirement, Beckham turned his attention to club ownership with a stake in Salford City, while he is a co-owner of MLS side Inter Miami.",
      "He has also been involved in a number of charity organisations and was also a key figure in Great Britain's successful campaign to host the 2012 Olympics. Beckham also spearheaded a hosting effort for the 2018 World Cup.",
      "Beckham previously received an OBE in 2003, while he was previously put forward for a knighthood in 2011. Leaked emails apparently from Beckham saw him criticise the system and honours committee in 2017.",
      "Writing on social media after he was eventually given a knighthood, wife Victoria Beckham said: “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official. Sir @davidbeckham!!!",
      "“What an honour, I couldn’t be prouder of you. Your dedication to the things that matter most — your country, your work, your passion, and most of all, your family — has never wavered.",
      "“The way you’ve touched so many lives over the years with kindness and humility speaks volumes about the man you are and continues to inspire us everyday. But above all else, I’m so, so proud to call you mine. I love you so much xxxx.”",
      "Former club Man United added: \"Sir David Beckham. Massive congratulations from everyone at United on this special achievement Becks - you truly deserve this.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford will reportedly have to take a pay cut in order to join Barcelona at the end of the season. The Spanish champions took the Manchester United forward on loan in the summer transfer window, and they inserted a £28m option-to-buy clause into the deal.",
      "He's made a sensational impact this term, netting six times and providing seven assists in a mere 14 appearances. Rashford received a standing ovation from the home supporters at the weekend following his goal in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Elche at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.",
      "The England international wrapped up the scoring for Hansi Flick's side, rattling the ball off the underside of the crossbar. Last month, Rashford revealed his desire to remain at Barcelona, despite having had to accept reduced terms to complete the temporary transfer.",
      "European football specialist Andy Brassell claims the Catalan outfit are keen to make the United loanee's move permanent, provided he agrees to further salary cuts. Speaking on the Trans Euro Express podcast, he discussed Barcelona's monetary constraints.",
      "\"Yeah, they're gonna make an honest man of him, it seems, and not just ask him to commit to another year's loan, which I've always suspected would be the case for obvious financial reasons,\" said Brassell. \"I mean, look, in terms of what he's actually produced while he's there, it's a no-brainer to want to keep him.",
      "\"He's been absolutely brilliant. I think he's been allowed a little bit more latitude by the fact that Raphinha's been injured and has been a regular face in the crowd or on the sidelines, and starting argy bargy after El Clásico.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"But look, Rashford has fitted in really well. Hansi Flick's very pleased with him. He got another great goal, a terrific finish left-footed from an angle to see off the game against Elche, which they eventually won 3-1.",
      "\"Elche, tougher opposition than they might seem on paper. And they have Iñaki Peña, the former Barcelona goalkeeper in goal, who had a really good game [on Sunday], I thought.",
      "\"And look, he's clicking with their best players. He's clicking with Lamine Yamal; he's clicking really well with Fermín [López] as well. Barca look like they're gonna score goals with Marcus Rashford in the team. It's that simple.\"",
      "Few players would be willing to take another wage reduction, but Brassell noted the strong bond between the club and the player. The European football pundit added: \"I think the mutual happiness of the relationship so far is very important.",
      "\"The fact that there is interest in Rashford, clearly, especially with a view to England and the World Cup next summer, in how he's doing over here. But, it does feel maybe from his perspective that there's enough distance for him just to be able to get his head down and get on with the game without sort of, I guess, microscopic levels of attention.",
      "\"Clearly, working with Hansi Flick is a real bonus. Barcelona have got an option which is around, thought to be around 30, 35 million euros. As we've underlined, Barcelona don't have tons of money, but I think when you bear in mind that they could amortise that over the length of a contract, that they are planning to give Rashford another pay cut, if he will accept it.",
      "\"Obviously, he's already taken a pay cut to go there, but he is speaking their language, and I don't mean Catalan. And I think the plan is that they will give him a longer contract with the same sort of money that he's getting at the moment.",
      "\"So, it works out to be spread over a longer period of time, which is how they will make it work financially. And look, long may it continue. It's good for England, it's good for him, and we wanna see him doing his stuff.\"",

      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate has praised Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim for turning things around after a rocky start to the 2025/26 season. The Red Devils had a shaky start, securing only four points from their first four matches, and following a 3-1 loss to Brentford in late September, the heat was on Amorim.",
      "Southgate was among those rumoured to take over from the Portuguese manager before Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe publicly backed him. It's believed that Ratcliffe holds Southgate in high regard, with Sir Dave Brailsford having previously advocated for the ex-England chief to succeed Eric ten Hag last year.",
      "The 55-year-old has been out of work since leaving his post with the Three Lions over a year ago. During his stint with England, Southgate led the team to two European Championship finals and the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup.",
      "Promoting his new book 'Dear England: Lessons in Leadership' in a series of interviews on Monday morning, Southgate confessed to the BBC that he's not in a hurry to jump back into management. When asked about the United job on The Sports Agents podcast, he said: \"The first thing is they've got a manager who seems to be doing pretty well at the moment.",
      "\"But yeah, I've had 37-odd years in football. It's been an amazing experience and if you told me as a 15-year-old that's what would happen, then I'd have been absolutely delighted..",
      "\"But there's other things in life. And having had the job I just had, where it was for my country, there was a bigger purpose than just the football. That's really hard to replicate.",
      "\"Working with young people as part of what I do now, it doesn't mean I've got ambitions to perhaps grow a business or work on leadership and other areas as well. But definitely there's something in me to work around young people, perhaps because I've been working with that sort of age group as well recently, and I can see that there is a chance to make a difference and to give groups belief and to unite people a bit more.\"",
      "Speaking on BBC 5 Live Sport, Southgate added more clarity: \"I haven't seen it yet,\" he replied when asked what job he would re-enter football for. After repeating the exact words from Amorim's work recently, it was suggested that his answer \"wasn't an outright no\" to the job, which he responded to with, \"Well, it's not an outright yes that's for certain.\"",

      "Manchester United have already been linked with several moves ahead of the January transfer window. Ruben Amorim’s primary focus will be to extend his side’s four-game unbeaten run in the Premier League, but United’s transfer plans will also be being formulated behind the scenes.",
      "The Red Devils drew with Nottingham Forest at the weekend, ending United’s win streak but not completely halting their momentum. Amorim appears to be getting a tune out of his team, though not all of his players are fully firing.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is one of those who have recently come under scrutiny due to not having the same type of impact as fellow new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. However, the striker played the full 90 minutes against Forest, unlike some of his United teammates who are struggling for regular game time.",
      "Amorim has already admitted that he expects some players will ask to leave the club in January and one United star has been linked with a move to Napoli. The Italian club have revitalised the careers of both Scott McTominay and current United loanee Rasmus Hojlund since the pair left Old Trafford.",
      "Sky Sport Italia reports that Napoli plan to target Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window. The 20-year-old midfielder submitted a loan request in the summer and is yet to start a league game this season.",
      "It is claimed that United are not considering a permanent sale, but would prefer Mainoo to join a club abroad, rather than another Premier League side. Napoli want to bolster their midfield after an injury to Kevin De Bruyne and would like to sign Mainoo on loan with an option to buy.",
      "This situation could see United repeat their past mistake of allowing players to join Napoli, only to watch them thrive in Italy. United loanee Rasmus Hojlund has scored four goals in eight games this term, while former midfielder McTominay was named Serie A MVP last season.",
      "Gary Lineker appears to have agreed with claims Benjamin Sesko has made a slow start at Manchester United - although the former Match of the Day host has backed the forward to succeed. The young striker was signed from RB Leipzig in the summer but has scored just twice in 11 appearances.",
      "Sesko’s recent performance against Forest was criticised by United legend Gary Neville. However, Lineker has been impressed by United’s new frontline and believes there is still more to come from Sesko - it may just take time for the striker to fulfil his potential.",
      "\"One thing I would say is that their recruitment for the first time in some time looks pretty good,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"Cunha looks a really good player and Mbeumo looks a really good player.",
      "\"Sesko I think might show something, I think he is promising, so I think it has been better recruitment, but time will tell on that as well.\"",
      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate has shared his stance on a possible return to the dugout. Southgate led the Three Lions to two Euros finals during his tenure before stepping down last year.",
      "He was recently linked with the United job before the club’s upturn in results. However, Southgate has admitted he is not desperate for a return to management.",
      "\"I had an amazing time [as England manager],\" Southgate told the BBC. \"Obviously the great thing with England was there is the high purpose that you are … you know, I joined the FA to try to help English football to become better, to help youth development, in particular.",
      "\"I somehow stumbled and ended up in the first-team manager’s job, and we had a pretty good period. But I am not desperate to stay in football. I have had 37 years in football.",
      "\"You can never say never, because I have just seen Martin O’Neill at his age go to Celtic, but it is not something that is high on my agenda at the moment.\"",

      "The 50-year-old played a vital role in securing the London 2012 Olympics, has been a Unicef ambassador for two decades and has been working with King Charles and The King's Foundation since 2024.",

      "After Beckham's ceremony he will choose to go by his new official title of Sir David Beckham. Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was knighted in 1999 and he admitted that he was unsure about adopting the new title but was advised to by his family.",
      "\"I put it to the family,\" Ferguson told United's official magazine in 2000. \"Cathy was a bit, 'Oh, I don't know, what would your father think?' And my son said, 'Mum, it's nothing to do with Dad's parents.",
      "\"They're gone. They'd be proud of him — you can't refuse this, it's recognition of what he's done.' We had a discussion and decided it was right.\"",

The footballing icon could have been attending such a ceremony much sooner were it not for some emails being leaked in 2017 that allegedly criticised the honours system and committee.",

      "Former Manchester United goalie David De Gea has emerged as a rare bright spot in Fiorentina's struggling season. The ex-Spanish international joined the Serie A team last year after a year-long stint as a free agent.",
      "His impressive performances earned him a fresh three-year contract at the Artemio Franci Stadium. Despite his continued good form, the ex-Red Devils keeper hasn't been able to prevent La Viola from plummeting to the bottom of Serie A.",
      "While the campaign is only ten matches old, there is a genuine threat the two-time Italian champions may get relegated to Serie B. Throughout the campaign the Italian media have also made their mind up on De Gea.",
      "The Premier League victor has managed two clean sheets in 10 league games, but the forwards haven't been pulling their weight. Consequently, Stefano Pioli's squad, along with Verona, are the only two teams yet to secure a single league win.",
      "Their latest match saw them suffer a 1-0 defeat at home to Lecce. Quotidiano Sportivo commended De Gea's performance, stating he wasn't to blame when \"disaster struck\" and Medon Berisha netted for the visitors.",
      "However, he's been demonstrating his leadership by facing the media following the club's losses. Following a 3-0 defeat to Inter Milan, he spoke with Firenze e Dintorni where he expressed his contentment with the club.",
      "He said: \"As soon as I arrived at Fiorentina, I immediately felt at ease. Viola Park is incredible and played a role in my final decision. With the staff, teammates, and staff, I feel like I'm part of a big family.",
      "\"I'm happy in Florence and the Florentine atmosphere. The fans are special. It's one of those places everyone would love to visit, and I'm lucky enough to live there. It's small, but it's beautiful to live there, and the food is special. All these aspects contributed to my decision to stay, with the desire to bring home a trophy.\"",
      "While Fiorentina are winless in the league, they are top of the Conference League table with two wins, eight goals scored and two clean sheets. However, when asked to compare their displays in the league and in Europe, De Gea was brutally honest.",
      "He said: \"The level of these two teams we faced in the Conference is lower than in Serie A. We played well in the Conference, but in the league we're not the same because it's tougher, we play against strong teams.",
      "\"We're struggling a lot and you can feel it in the locker room too: the only solution is to work and fight game after game. Certainly no one expected this start to the season.",
      "\"We haven't won yet, and we're struggling. The team isn't performing well, but we have to stay positive. We need to believe more among ourselves.",
      "\"We have to believe more than anyone else, raising the bar and winning games. Serie A is tough, but that's football: we have to stay united with the fans, it's very hard for them too, but we have to follow the same path.\"",

      "Manchester United's Amad Diallo has hit back at a 'false' social media claim that he visited his 'pregnant wife' after Saturday's 2-2 draw against Nottingham Forest. The 23-year-old winger scored United's second goal at The City Ground, helping Ruben Amorim's side to secure a point and extend their unbeaten streak to four matches.",
      "Despite heading into the Nottingham match on a three-game winning streak, the Reds had to settle for a draw. After Casemiro put United ahead, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the tables, putting Forest 2-1 up. However, Amad found the net in the 81st minute, ensuring a point for Amorim's squad.",
      "Following the match, a social media post claimed that Amad had visited his 'pregnant wife', accompanied by two photos. The account, boasting over 33,000 followers, posted: \"Amad Diallo visits his pregnant wife after the weekend game. Impossible not to love them [red love heart emoji and goat emoji].\"",
      "In response, Amad dismissed the claim and called for respect for his privacy. He retweeted the message, commenting: \"Spreading false information will not help you promote your page [cross mark emoji] A bit respect for my privacy.\"",
      "It was later suggested that one of the photos included in the original tweet was AI-generated, prompting Amad's reaction.",
      "Amad Diallo's first goal of the season for Manchester United came against Nottingham Forest, a feat made all the more impressive considering his deeper role since Bryan Mbeumo's summer arrival.",
      "Despite not being in as many scoring positions, Amad nearly bagged a second late on, only to be denied by a line clearance from Murillo, which could have secured a potential match-winning third goal for the Reds.",
      "United head coach Amorim was full of praise for Amad in his post-match comments. He said: \"Amad has a lot of talent, he is growing up really fast. I think we have a lot of players that are young and talented but we need to help in all the details.",
      "\"He is improving a lot, he can play in different positions, I think he can be so much better. More consistent in every detail, when he receives the ball, in build-up, when he is in the final third.",
      "\"You could see in the first half he had some opportunities. In a lot of games, he has that opportunity coming inside and the shot is not there yet. We are working on that, so he has potential to do better.\"",

      "Manchester United's latest transfer pursuit could inadvertently pave the way for Barcelona to secure Marcus Rashford on a permanent basis this summer.",
      "The 28-year-old moved to the Catalan club on a season-long loan deal after being deemed surplus to requirements at United. Rashford had previously endured a brief loan stint at Aston Villa last term amid mounting friction with new boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "With the January transfer window approaching in under two months, clubs are already eyeing potential signings – and United have emerged as active participants. Amorim's squad are understood to be pursuing a fresh striker option, with Brazilian talent Vitor Roque reportedly catching their attention after being 'reborn' in his homeland.",
      "Palmeiras secured Roque's services from Barcelona in February for approximately £22million, establishing a new record as South America's most costly transfer.",
      "The forward endured a difficult spell at Barcelona, managing merely two goals across 16 outings, yet his fortunes transformed dramatically following his Palmeiras switch.",
      "He has swiftly rejuvenated his prospects, bagging 17 strikes and contributing five assists during his debut campaign at the club.",
      "The striker now harbours ambitions of earning a place in Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil setup for next year's World Cup.",
      "Should United genuinely pursue Roque, they may need to exercise patience until summer, given the youngster's desire to remain in Brazil through June.",
      "Beyond that point, Spanish publication Sport suggests he 'would be open to a new adventure.'",
      "A crucial element in any potential deal between United and Roque would be Barcelona's sell-on clause, rumoured to be 20%. This means if Amorim's team were to sign Roque for £50m, Barcelona would pocket £10m from the sale.",
      "Such a financial boost could then aid the La Liga titans in securing a permanent move for Rashford. Barcelona have an option-to-buy clause worth £28m, although they are not compelled to trigger it.",
      "A new striker would also provide competition for Benjamin Sesko, who has found it challenging to make a significant impact in the Premier League so far, netting just twice in his first 11 games.",

      "Meanwhile, Kai is currently part of the United academy with ambitions of emulating his legendary father's career. Despite only being 16, he has already starred for the Reds Under-18s side.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his development was halted by a nasty foot injury which left him devastated. Whilst side-lined, he tuned in to watch Rashford shine in La Liga.",
      "Following the former Red Devils star's goal, he reshared an Instagram post from Rashford on his own social media. The England star posted a photo of himself celebrating his goal. In the caption, he wrote: \"Home win, good vibes. Thanks for your support. Tieree that one was for you as promised.\"",
      "Sadly for Kai, many of his latest posts haven't been as upbeat. When he picked up his injury, he shared a post on social media with the caption \"Life can't get worse,\" which left many fans feeling sorry for him.",

      "\"The important thing is always the team and today we won. So I am happy for this. My focus is not so much on the output. If I am doing the right things, I know I will always be able to score and assist. My focus is with the team, to build relationships and feel comfortable.\"",

      "United decided to go another season without a midfield recruit. That position will be the priority at the end of the season, but a new wing-back should also be at the top of the shopping list.",
      "The wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's formation. They provide width, quality in attack and defensive cover. They must have an engine to get up and down the line. It's a specialist role in the system.",
      "Amad has nailed down the right-wing back spot and delivered some excellent performances from that role throughout October, but there are question marks on the opposite side.",
      "Diogo Dalot was poor against Sunderland, despite his throw-ins being effective. He was the worst performer in the first half against Liverpool, albeit he recovered to end the game strongly. He was fine against Brighton and then took further backwards steps against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Dalot's versatility has been a selling point throughout his career. The 26-year-old is willing to play wherever he is needed, but his performances indicate he is far more comfortable when operating on the right.",
      "Following some unconvincing displays from Patrick Dorgu, Amorim has played Dalot at left wing-back in recent weeks, which was logical given his experience and the importance of the games.",
      "Dorgu was removed from the firing line after showing signs of greenness. The Denmark international is still developing his game and Amorim preferred Dalot during a run of games that he needed to win.",
      "Dalot was replaced by Dorgu in the 68th minute at the City Ground last weekend, but he might have been hooked at the interval if there had been a better option on the bench.",
      "The majority of Nottingham Forest's attacking play came down Dalot's flank and he was too passive in the build-up to Morgan Gibbs-White's goal, failing to prevent the cross into the box.",
      "It will be fascinating to see whether Dalot retains his starting role against Tottenham. He does not deserve to keep his place, but Amorim may still consider him ahead of Dorgu.",
      "Dorgu was always bound to need time and patience. United signed Dorgu for an initial €30million (£25m) from Lecce, who banked a club-record transfer fee for the 21-year-old after persistent negotiations.",
      "He arrived in the winter window and joined a struggling dressing room. \"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season,\" Dorgu said when he spoke in August.",
      "United believe Dorgu has the attributes to become a top player. \"I had interest from big teams in Italy as well, so it (United's interest) wasn’t a surprise,\" he said. \"If you're doing well, the big teams are going to look. I was surprised that they were really aggressive to get it done quickly, and I was really happy for that.\"",
      "How long Dorgu needs to reach his potential is another matter. He was a heavily data-driven signing and has the ideal physical attributes to play at left wing-back, but his final ball must improve.",
      "That's why United may need to sign a new left wing-back at the end of the season. United will know by then whether Dorgu is ready to start regularly, but it might be sensible to sign a player in that role who can hit the ground running, someone who doesn't need to improve.",
      "The wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's system and he needs the right personnel.",

      "Particularly since the arrival of Pep Guardiola on the other side of Manchester, there has been an obsession in English football with dominating possession.",
      "However, this season has seen a change in tack from Premier League coaches. The more direct approach has been welcomed back and having less of the ball is on-trend again, with Manchester United one of the teams keen to get from back to front as fast as possible.",
      "In the victory over Sunderland United had more possession, but against both Liverpool and Brighton the Reds were comfortable without the ball, particularly against the Seagulls. Ruben Amorim's side were compact and waited for the right moment to pick them off.",
      "Against Nottingham Forest, United had to change back to being the team in possession. United have been most dangerous in recent weeks when they have been in transition but in Forest they found a side that wanted to do exactly the same.",
      "Sean Dyche has built a managerial career off making teams hard to beat. His teams are often physical and do not need to have the ball to provide a threat.",
      "With the hosts happy to sit back, it was on United to have the ball and try and make things happen. Unfortunately for them, they found Forest tough to break down.",
      "The Reds were not as free-flowing when they had the ball and were only ahead at half-time thanks to a goal from a corner. In the second half, their good luck ran out.",
      "Inside five minutes Forest had the lead and United knew they needed to break them down to get anything out of the game. Amad's wonder strike saved the day but for large parts of the second half it was hard to see where the equaliser was going to come from.",
      "From that perspective, the weekend draw should be seen as a warning to the Reds.",
      "United are now a team that are happy to play on the counter and try and catch teams unaware. However, there will be more occasions to come - against the likes of Burnley, West Ham and others - where the Reds will need to be the team dominating the ball and they will have to find a new way to win those games.",
      "In those matches, United would be wise to be quicker with the ball. When they looked most threatening against Forest they were spreading play quickly through Bruno Fernandes and causing overloads, particularly through Amad and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Once the tempo slows, that is when the opposition look comfortable, so for Amorim the task must be to ensure that energy remains high. Make no mistake, the Reds' play has improved since October and undoubtedly United would have lost that game last season.",
      "But if they are to become genuine top four challengers both this season and moving forward, Amorim needs to find a way of winning matches when they are the ones setting the tempo.",

      "Luke Shaw handled a question about receiving criticism from Roy Keane brilliantly when he spoke in September.",
      "Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby defeat and Keane ripped into him after the game, saying he'd been \"getting away with murder for years\" and was reluctant to make a tackle.",
      "The 30-year-old responded when he talked to journalists after Manchester United's win against Chelsea. \"I think sometimes you just have to take it on the chin,\" said Shaw.",
      "\"He's [Keane] got a lot of experience. He was one of the best captains ever for Man United. Of course it hurts. I think criticism is part of being a football player. I listen to it. But for me, I think he was right.",
      "\"I think that last week, I wasn't at my level at all. I don't need Roy Keane to tell me. I think after the game I knew that. I knew that, but of course it hurts. I'm not getting any younger now. I need to be consistent. I've had a lot of ups and downs, but for me now, it's about keeping that consistency at a high level.\"",
      "It was a measured response. Shaw demonstrated his experience by giving a thoughtful answer and he deserves huge credit for also responding on the pitch across the last six weeks.",
      "Shaw was excellent in the first half against Nottingham Forest, winning all four of his duels and recording a pass completion rate of 90 per cent. He was a commanding presence and made several important interceptions.",
      "Diogo Dalot had a game to forget at left wing-back, but Shaw mopped up at the back to deliver another performance that will attract the attention of England manager Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Shaw will play himself back into the England squad if he maintains his current performance levels, and has enjoyed a good campaign so far if you ignore his blip against Manchester City.",
      "United's failure to qualify for European football and an early Carabao Cup exit has benefited Shaw, whose body has struggled with the load of playing a game every three or four days.",
      "Although Shaw's quality has never been questioned, he has spent far too much time on the sidelines during his United stint and an injury has usually been just around the corner after a good run of form.",
      "This season should be different due to the reduced workload. Shaw has longer to recover and prepare, so it would be incredibly disappointing if he picks up an issue when there are fewer games.",
      "Fans have joked that the secret to Shaw performing consistently is playing in a World Cup season or a campaign before a European Championship because his best seasons have tended to be before major tournaments.",
      "Lisandro Martinez has returned to full training and will compete with Shaw when he is available for selection again, but the Argentina international may struggle to regain that starting role.",
      "Shaw has the left side position of the back-three nailed down. Ruben Amorim has not asked him to play at wing-back, where he previously played for England.",
      "That has helped Shaw to avoid injuries. The wing-back roles in Amorim's system are physically demanding, and even Shaw would concede that he no longer has the legs to play that role.",
      "Amorim enjoyed an October to remember and Shaw was crucial in important wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, so he merits a recall to the England squad when it's announced this week.",
      "Shaw responded on the pitch after Keane's criticism - and that is what a professional should do.",

      "Former Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason had the mandate of leading West Brom back to the topflight this season, but the Baggies have struggled and Collyer's loan stint has not gone as planned so far.",
      "Collyer was limited to seven substitute appearances after his arrival. He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he picked up a muscle injury.",
      "The 21-year-old is currently not training as he recovers from the issue. \"Well, neither of them trained with a team, so no,\" Mason told the Express & Star when he was asked whether Collyer and a teammate would be available for selection against Charlton on Tuesday night.",
      "Mason has previously praised Collyer, saying: \"Toby's a young player, but we know we're going to need him and he's going to help us. I've wanted Toby for a few weeks now. He's someone that I really believe in, which is important and I have that belief in all of my players.",
      "\"But when you go on loan to somewhere, I think you need to feel like you're wanted from the club and the manager and he certainly is that. Hopefully we can help him because if we help him improve and grow as a player, then it's certainly going to be beneficial to us.",
      "\"I think there's loads of room and loads of growth to develop. That's certainly going to happen on the training pitch. The reality is the game is the best teacher.",
      "\"The more game exposure you can get, the better, especially at a young age. I'm sure and I expect that Toby knows that I believe in him, which for me is super important.",
      "\"I'm going to put a lot of energy, the same amount of energy that I've put into him as every other one of my players, to help them grow and improve.\"",
      "Mason added: \"He's a good kid, humble, wants to work, wants to be part of it. You can feel that as soon as you speak to him. He wants to play football, loves football and that's super important. We want those types of people in the building who want to work and be part of something.\"",
      "Collyer made 13 first-team appearances in a breakthrough 2024/2025 season at Old Trafford.",
      "Last year, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",
      "Collyer's contract at United runs until the summer of 2027, with the option of another year.",

In an interview with Piers Morgan, the Portugal international gave another detailed take on the issues at United and explained why he believes his old club continues to struggle.",
      "He said: \"For me, I'm sad because of the club, that's one of the most important clubs in the world, and a club that I still have in my heart because of the obvious reasons.",

      "The latest instalment of Sports Interactive's globally popular game was finally released on Tuesday, after months of eager anticipation. Fans have been left waiting since last year's edition failed to launch, meaning it's been two years since the last FM hit the shelves. This might be a blessing in disguise for United, considering the club's struggles over the past year or so. However, a new game brings new opportunities, and a revamped forward line at Old Trafford also means there are new finishers to watch out for.",
      "Despite a wave of summer signings, it's midfielder and United captain Bruno Fernandes who is the joint-top finisher in their squad. The Portuguese maestro has an impressive finishing score of 15, equal with Marcus Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona for the season.",
      "Rashford also tops the list when it comes to United's fastest players. His speed score of 17 puts him level with another player who isn't even at Old Trafford this term, Rasmus Hojlund, who is excelling on loan at Napoli.",
      "With Rashford and Hojlund away on loan, the quickest player remaining at United is defender Patrick Dorgu, who has a pace score of 16 in this year's edition of FM.",
      "Dorgu is also among the 11 prodigies at Old Trafford. The Danish defender boasts a potential ability of 8.5 and provides gamers with the flexibility to utilise him as a left-back, in left midfield or on the left wing.",

      "Last season, United changed that mindset slightly by bringing in Patrick Dorgu for the first team and Ayden Heaven to provide cover and potential at centre-back.",
      "Fast forward nearly 12 months and United still have not quite solved their problems at left wing-back. Despite Dorgu being signed, Diogo Dalot has been the main starter on that side.",
      "His performances have not been the best though. Dalot was easily worked by Dan Ndoye for the first against Nottingham Forest and he was flat-footed for the second.",
      "Dorgu came on to replace him midway through the second half and while he looks more comfortable than Dalot, he is perhaps not the finished product. This leaves United with a conundrum.",
      "Their only other option at the club to play in that position is Diego Leon but he is still very raw and is getting up to speed with the academy. It makes you wonder then whether or not United should look to jump into the January transfer window and sign a player for the here and now.",
      "In Amorim's system, the wing-back roles are so important. Take a look at the right flank for instance.",
      "Amad is by no means the perfect wing-back but his connection with Bryan Mbeumo has led to the pair becoming a big threat for United, something we are just not seeing on the left.",

      "Manchester United player Joshua Zirkzee could be on his way out with AS Roma now, reportedly, interested in the Dutch international. Previously linked with Sevilla and West Ham United, Roma is the latest club to show interest in the versatile forward.",
      "This isn't the first time the Giallorossi have been in the running to offer an escape route to a United player. Over the summer, Jadon Sancho was on their radar, but wage demands reportedly scuppered the deal, with a failure to raise funds through a sale a factor, leading to Sancho joining Aston Villa on loan instead.",
      "Sky Sport Switzerland reports that Zirkzee is \"open\" to taking a pay cut to facilitate a move to the Stadio Olimpico. Another Italian club, AC Milan, are also listed as a potential destination for the forward.",
      "Zirkzee joined United after a successful stint at Bologna - where he helped the squad qualify for the Champions League under Thiago Motta in 2024. A reunion with Motta at Juventus had been suggested, but this fell through when Motta lost his job in Turin in March.",
      "Both Roma and Milan are currently in the Champions League spots in Serie A after 10 matches, but both teams could benefit from additional fire-power. Roma have only managed to score 10 times in the league, so far, while Milan's striker Santi Gimenez missed their weekend victory over Roma due to injury.",
      "Zirkzee has only managed to clock-up 82 league minutes this season, with his playing time being curtailed by the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. The majority of his game-time came when he was brought on as a first-half substitute for the injured Cunha during a win over Burnley in August.",
      "Despite United's pursuit of an equaliser against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Zirkzee remained on their bench. The only changes made by Amorim were the introduction of defenders Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, with a late volley from Amad salvaging a point.",
      "A move in January seems to be Zirkzee's best shot at securing a place in the Netherlands squad for the World Cup - provided the Oranje can secure the necessary results in November to confirm their participation next summer. He was part of the Euro 2024 squad and played four UEFA Nations League matches in 2024, but hasn't represented his country since starting against Bosnia and Herzegovina nearly a year ago.",
      "United boss Amorim addressed the situation earlier this season - saying about Zirkzee and Napoli target Kobbie Mainoo: \"They want to play,\" as he added: \"Like you said, there's a World Cup.",
      "\"There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So, I understand that but they are our players, and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",

      "Alvaro Fernandez kissed the Real Madrid badge as he celebrated scoring a stunning goal last weekend.",
      "Anyone of a Manchester United persuasion who happened to tune into Madrid's game against Valencia would have winced as Fernandez fired a knuckled shot into the top right corner.",
      "The technique was exquisite. The execution was a thing of art. The goal has amassed more than 10million views on a single X post and United fans have wondered: why did the club sell such a talented player?",
      "Erik ten Hag made some inexplicable calls during his two-and-a-half years in Manchester, but perhaps his decision to overlook Fernandez will be seen as the worst of the bunch.",
      "Fernandez joined Benfica on loan in January 2024 with a view to a permanent transfer in the summer window and the Portuguese giants subsequently triggered their option to buy him.",
      "Benfica paid €6million (£5.2m) plus €3m (£2.6m) in potential add-ons to sign Fernandez and United inserted a 15 per cent sell-on clause, along with a buy-back option, into the sale.",
      "In the summer, Fernandez signed for Real Madrid in a €50m (£43m) deal. United fans asked why Fernandez was allowed to slip through the net and their frustration will only worsen as he reaches his potential.",
      "The defender's superb goal against Valencia was a reminder of what United let go, but it feels likely that Fernandez will go on and lift major honours with Madrid during his career, which will hurt more.",
      "Ten Hag should shudder at Fernandez's progress because the decision to sell him reflects poorly on his management. He did not fancy Fernandez when all the signs said the player possessed huge potential.",
      "Fernandez joined United's academy from Madrid as a teenager in 2020 and picked up the Denzil Haroun Reserve-Team Player of the Year award in 2021/22.",
      "He built on that campaign by enjoying a loan with Preston in 2022/2023, proving his quality and durability in the Championship and United sources said the temporary move had been a resounding success.",
      "Fernandez travelled on United's pre-season tour of the USA in the summer of 2023 after an injury to Tyrell Malacia. There was a first-team opening at left-back, but Fernandez's opportunities were limited.",
      "His only appearance in the States that summer came against Wrexham in San Diego when an academy side was fielded. Even Brandon Williams was handed more minutes.",
      "There was also a sliding doors moment in August 2023 when Luke Shaw picked up an injury against Tottenham. Malacia remained on the sidelines, recovering from knee surgery, but Diogo Dalot started at left back in the following game and Fernandez was named on the bench.",
      "To make matters worse, Sergio Reguilon was signed on loan from Tottenham on deadline day.",
      "Fernandez's loan to Granada was confirmed on the same day and he later criticised Ten Hag.",
      "“What message did United give me? That I should go out on loan, that Ten Hag didn’t count on me, that I should continue to gain experience, rhythm, and we’ll see what happens in the future,\" he told The Athletic in December 2023.",
      "\"But it’s clear that football doesn’t end at any club and that you have to keep working. My main objective is to return to United and make a place for myself there.”",
      "Fernandez spent the first half of the season with Granada before being loaned to Benfica in the winter transfer window. United were happy with the permanent fee they banked from the Portuguese club, but it looked low when Madrid offered €50m (£43m) to sign him just a year later.",
      "Ten Hag is responsible for selling Fernandez. He overlooked the defender in favour of Malacia and Reguilon. Malacia was placed in the 'bomb squad' by Ruben Amorim and Reguilon is a free agent this season.",
      "Fernandez is thriving at Madrid and seems to be just getting started at the Bernabeu, so United fans cannot be blamed for cursing Ten Hag's decision.",
      "The irony is that Fernandez would have been perfect for Amorim. The current options at left wing-back, Dalot and Patrick Dorgu, are unconvincing. Fernandez would have excelled in Amorim's system. His marauding runs forward were a highlight of visits to Leigh Sports Village, where the academy plays.",
      "Some of the United staff who worked on the deal to sign Fernandez have since left the club. They are proud of his journey and have taken a great interest in his move to the world's biggest club.",
      "The remaining staff at Carrington who worked with Fernandez will wince whenever he plays.",

      "Manchester United's winger was only absent during the September international break due to a muscle injury he picked up against Burnley at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha recorded an assist during Brazil's win against South Korea during the last international break.",

      "On Monday, Ancelotti announced his Brazil squad for the November international break, and the United pair will represent their country in friendlies against Senegal and Tunisia.",
      "Ancelotti surprised the Brazilian press by recalling former Liverpool midfielder Fabinho, but he explained that was due to his desire for another player like Casemiro.",
      "\"I want to find a profile that fits Casemiro's characteristics,\" he said. \"We have very good midfielders, but with different defensive profiles, and that's why we called up Fabinho.",
      "\"He has the characteristics, the structure, the knowledge of the position and the experience. He is a player who is currently playing and has already played at a very high level in Europe.\"",
      "Ancelotti was asked about his decision to snub Tottenham forward Richarlison, and he complimented Cunha's skillset when answering. “We are evaluating technical criteria,” he said. “He’s a centre-forward, a striker with a profile different from João Pedro, Matheus Cunha or Vitor Roque, who like to play with the ball.\"",
      "Cunha scored his first goal for United since his £62.5million arrival against Brighton.",
      "\"I try my best to adapt, to learn,\" Cunha said while on international duty last month.",
      "\"It's only been two months [at United], but it feels like I've been here a long time because of the club's current situation, because I have to deliver results as quickly as possible since I was a new signing. All of this helps a lot in adapting faster and feeling my best in the national team.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana has insisted that he does not fear any opponent on the football pitch and would not define himself as a loser since moving to Trabzonspor on loan in September.",
      "Onana began the season as back-up to Altay Bayindir after suffering an injury during pre-season. The Cameroonian was given his chance to impress against Grimsby Town but a poor performance sealed his fate at Old Trafford.",
      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",
      "\"I never fear anyone. Because in this life, I only fear God,\" he explained.",
      "\"Therefore, to be honest, no one can scare me. For me, most of the time, the important thing is to try to do what's best for the team.",
      "\"If I need to play out from the back, I first analyse. Is the opponent pressing? Are they pressing with the winger, the striker, or are their centre-backs stepping up? These are the things I need to see when the ball is at my feet.",
      "\"I track how the opponent moves and look at the options before making my decision.\" United fans would argue that Onana did not distribute the ball as well as was expected during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but the 29-year-old refuses to see that as a failure.",
      "\"Looking back, my career has really been amazing,\" he continued. \"There have been many ups and downs in this process, but that also meant a lot of learning moments, a lot of experiences.",
      "\"Coming from Cameroon and playing in Barcelona, Ajax, Inter, Manchester, and now in Trabzonspor is magnificent. Coming from there and looking at today, seeing what I've achieved in the last 10-11 years - amazing, really amazing.",
      "\"Every time I put on my boots or gloves, I want to win. Because at the end of the day, that's what we play for.",
      "\"We play to win, and I’m not afraid of anyone. When I step onto the pitch, I either win or I learn. I don’t see myself as a loser. If I don’t win, I take it as an opportunity to learn.",
      "\"Let me give you an example: my first match here was against Fenerbahce. We played well, but we didn’t win. But I don’t see it as a loss. I learned something, for instance, I learned how the referees are here.\"",
      "Onana's Trabzonspor now sit second in the Super Lig table and are just five points behind league leaders Galatasaray. Next up for them is a trip to the table-toppers on Saturday evening.",

      "Dorgu was shown a straight red card in United's 3-2 win over Ipswich Town in February after a high challenge on Omari Hutchinson. The £25million signing got a slight touch on the ball but followed through and caught his opponent late on the top of the shin.",
      "He was initially given a yellow card before England was advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor. After a brief check, the decision was overturned and Dorgu was sent off.",
      "At the time, England was seen explaining the decision before brandishing the red card and former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee Keith Hackett admitted that it opened the referee up to backlash.",
      "\"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent,\" he told Football Insider. \"Frankly, [when refereeing myself] I monitored the player leaving the field of play without engaging in any discussion, it is easy in the heat of the situation to be accused of saying something.",
      "\"You should monitor for sure, but there is no point of explaining why the player is being sent off, it is pretty obvious when you make a challenge with such force.”",
      "This week, the Premier League have announced their match officials appointments for the weekend's action and England will be in charge for United's trip to the City Ground. Scott Ledger and Akil Howson will be his assistants, with Bobby Madley joining the managers in the technical area.",

      "While United have looked to be more direct with Senne Lammens in goal, being able to play out from the back is still a big part of modern-day football, and Bayindir is clearly keen to get the practice in with his feet.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "A perfect Champions League record would land clubs a minimum of £115m this season, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City due more with TV payments.",
      "There is a reason that eight of Europe’s biggest spenders in the 2025 transfer window came from the Premier League, including all six Champions League qualifiers: prize money.",
      "The levels of money on offer in numerous competitions are preposterous and perhaps no more so than in the Champions League, in which clubs can earn well in excess of nine figures.",
      "",
      "As part of the revamped formats for their three main competitions, UEFA have announced a revenue distribution system for how the total prize money of around £2.88billion would be allocated each season up to 2026/27.",
      "Just over £2.1bn (74.38%) will be distributed to clubs competing in the Champions League and Super Cup, £490.7m (17.02%) to teams participating in the Europa League, and £247.5m (8.6%) split between those in the Europa Conference League.",

      "Undistributed amounts from each league phase draw – £608,000 – are also allocated proportionately to these ranking payments at the end of the league phase, so the prize money for positions will be higher.",
      "There is also extra money on offer for finishing in the top eight and for coming between 9th and 16th. This is how Liverpool made a fortune despite being knocked out in the last 16.",
      "3) The ‘value pillar’ (£740.6m/35%) – a combination of payments based on club coefficient rankings and the TV pool. This can be harder to accurately calculate but will naturally reward the ‘bigger’ clubs and traditional elite.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and the Premier League’s four regular European qualifiers in Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would be the biggest winners here, with Qarabag, Pafos and Kairat due more modest sums.",

      "There is also a fixed fee of £3.73m for all clubs eliminated in the qualification play-offs before the commencement of the league phase. That is for the Celtics and Rangers’ of this world.",
      "",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are hoping to complete an audacious double deal in January as they target Elliot Anderson and Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "The Red Devils have been very active in the transfer market in recent months, with club chiefs sanctioning a significant squad overhaul after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "In the summer transfer window, Man Utd largely focused on improving their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also landed Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana as their No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Ruben Amorim‘s side were able to secure these marquee signings as they raised funds through offloading Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho.",

      "Their transfer business has had an impact on their on-field performances, with Man Utd currently on a four-game unbeaten run in the Premier League as they have entered the European conversation.",
      "Still, Man Utd have improvements to make in certain positions, with it widely reported that their top priority is to sign a new No.6 in January or next summer.",
      "United made an audacious move for Brighton star Carlos Baleba in the summer, though they were priced out of a move for the £100m-rated midfielder.",
      "And with Baleba’s form declining in recent months, Man Utd have reportedly turned to an alternative.",
      "A report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claims the Red Devils are already ‘prepping a giant offer’ to sign Nottingham Forest and England star Anderson in January.",
      "This may be difficult as Forest will obviously be keen to keep their prized asset, but Man Utd are said to be ‘confident that a deal can be struck’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Forest are under no pressure to sell and value Anderson highly after his seamless integration.",
      "‘As such, we understand Forest are setting their stall out around the £80m mark, though United believe a deal can be struck for closer to £60m.’",

      "Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has not minced his words on his former club and Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ronaldo had two spells at Man Utd as a player, with it fair to say that his first stint at Old Trafford was far more successful than his second.",
      "The five-time Ballon d’Or winner butted heads with Erik ten Hag before leaving the Red Devils, with the Dutchman rightly preferring to select United’s younger stars at the beginning of the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Naturally, Ronaldo did not respond well to this treatment and spat his dummy out en route to having his contract terminated by mutual consent, with the 40-year-old hitting out at Ten Hag, the Glazer family and club legend in a now-infamous interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "Since leaving, Man Utd have continued to flounder as they have struggled under Amorim before their recent upturn, while Ronaldo has spent the last couple of years in the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr.",
      "Now. Ronaldo has had another interview with Morgan and has hit out at Man Utd again.",
      "He has revealed his thoughts on the “sad” situation at Man Utd, claiming Amorim is “doing his best” and cannot “do miracles”.",
      "“I’m sad because [Manchester United] are one of the most important clubs in the world, that I still have in my heart for obvious reasons,” Ronaldo said on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "READ: Arsenal lose, United beat Spurs, City beat Liverpool: Five things to mitigate the worst interlull ever",
      "“You have to [have] intelligent people, smart people, to create a base [that you can build on] for the future, as Manchester United had many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, David Beckham.",
      "“Manchester United right now don’t have a structure. I hope that changes in the future, because the potential of the club is amazing. They are one of the most important clubs of the century.”",
      "When asked about his relationship with his former club, Ronaldo responded: “I was there for so many years. I won the Champions League, the Golden Ball, I won like, 12, 13 or 14 trophies there. Manchester United are still in my heart.",
      "“I love that club. But we have to all be honest and say they are not on a good path. They need to change. And it’s not only about the coach and the players, in my opinion.",
      "“[Ruben Amorim is] doing his best. [He’s] not going to do miracles. This is impossible.",
      "“Manchester United have good players but some of them don’t have the mind, what Manchester United is.”",
      "Ronaldo extended his Al Nassr contract until 2027 and this could be his last before retirement. He also admitted to Morgan that he will call time on his career “soon”.",
      "“Soon. But I think I will be prepared,” Ronaldo said on retirement.",
      "“It will be tough, of course. It will be difficult? Yes. Probably (I) will cry, yes… I’m (an) open person. (It) will be very, very difficult, yes.",

      "Despite a set of great of results, there are still some areas that are concerning Man Utd fans and former players with Sharpe insisting they need an upgrade on right-back Dalot.",
      "Speaking to Adventure Gamers, Sharpe said: “Both Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu have struggled at left wing-back for Manchester United this season.",
      "“I’ve always thought Dalot is a bit sloppy in his decision-making at times – he gives the ball away cheaply and gets caught out of position defensively. I also don’t think he gets close enough to wingers when they’re crossing the ball, so there’s a few things in his game that I feel need improving.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",
      "“I think it’s an area Man United would want to look at in January or next summer. Dorgu looks like he could become quite a good player, but he’s had a couple of injuries and is a bit inconsistent with his form, so he’s not quite ready to be relied on just yet.”",
      "Man Utd spent over £200m on new signings in the summer transfer window with Bryan Mbeumo arriving as one of five new signings.",
      "The Cameroon international has adapted better than any of the summer signings with five goals in 11 matches in all competitions, including three in their last three matches.",
      "On Mbeumo, Sharpe added: “Bryan Mbeumo has been absolutely fantastic this season. It’s not just his ability to create chances and score goals, but his awareness of what’s going on in the game is what has particularly impressed me.",
      "“He’s always involved the game in some way – he never switches off, and you can tell that he was previous Premier League experience. His work rate is phenomenal as well – he’s always looking to run into gaps and create space for others.",
      "“For me, he’s right up there with the best wingers in the Premier League at the moment. He’s scoring goals and creating chances, and his stats stack up as some of the best in the division currently.”",

      "The Red Devils invested £74m in Sesko as the Slovenia international arrived at Old Trafford in the summer from RB Leipzig after scoring 39 goals in 87 appearances for the Bundesliga club.",
      "The 22-year-old has scored just two goals in 11 matches in all competitions since moving to Man Utd and has faced criticism in recent weeks.",

      "“For 80 million pound, you can say he’s young, has a lot of potential and is only just settling in, but you still want to see a bit more.”",
      "But former Liverpool midfielder Hamann insists that Sesko and Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade have been more impressive this season than Arsenal striker Gyokeres, who has scored six goals in 13 matches so far.",
      "When asked which player out of Sesko, Gyokeres and Woltemade will score the most goals this season, Hamann told footballblog.co.uk: ‘I think the club that will be creating the most chances will be Arsenal, and so that probably puts Gyokeres ahead of the other two, Woltemade and Sesko.",

      "“If Woltemade is the regular penalty taker for Newcastle from now until the end of the season, then I think I will put Woltemade down as the player to score the most out of those three this season.",

      "“He was always very confident and he’s got a lot of belief in his ability. But then when you come to a club where things are not great, it’s difficult for a striker.",
      "“Confidence is a big thing, and poor morale at a club doesn’t help. I think he’s done okay so far, but we certainly haven’t seen the best yet because he’s an exceptional talent.",
      "“People in Salzburg said at 16, 17, when he came to the club, he was better than Erling Haaland. Obviously that’s not the case at the moment, but I think potentially he could be a player who scores 20, 25 goals every season.”",

      "Man United’s recovery from deepest and darkest crisis still hasn’t been enough to get that lad a haircut after the 2-2 draw at Forest, but it’s still delivered 10 points in four games and that will very much do. And Liverpool’s win over Villa last week has taken the edge off slightly at Anfield.",
      "It’s going to be hard to concoct a full crisis for any of the Big Six now, but our best bet might be Thomas Frank over at Spurs after the most small-time ‘big club’ home performance in living memory against Chelsea. The initial plan appeared to be to play for a goalless draw and then, when that didn’t work out, play for a 1-0 defeat. It’s a mad plan for Spurs at home to absolutely anyone, but especially a Chelsea side that absolutely isn’t all that having lost to Sunderland the previous weekend and then nearly contrived all sorts of unpleasantness at desperate Wolves in the Carabao.",
      "Frank absolutely needs a result and a performance against United to silence some of the increasingly loud doubts and also at least start to turn around that laughably poor home form, albeit only some of which – but an inevitably increasing amount – has come on his watch.",
      "Lose to United for the first time in over three years, and Spurs will drop back into mid-table where, frankly, their performances deserve to have them. Do it in anything like a repeat of the drab, ambition-free nature of the Chelsea defeat and suddenly there’s a story to fill the void and an awkward couple of weeks for Frank before the blessed relief of another away game. Which is at Arsenal. Oof.",

      "Not sure City can be plunged easily back into crisis, but we’re damn sure Liverpool can. Nothing about the way a team that has conceded 14 goals already in the Premier League this season has gone about their defending suggests they are in any way ready to cope with Erling Haaland in his current preposterous pomp, so there really is every chance for a silly high-scoring game here that does much to sustain us through the days and nights that follow.",
      "Is a wild 5-3 in the last Premier League game for 13 days really too much to ask? We say no. No it is not. More defensive calamity. More Virgil van Dijk looking daggers at Milos Kerkez and wondering how it’s all come to this. More Haaland doing the robot.",
      "While we’re being greedy, we’ll take a Salah hat-trick at the other end as well, please. We just want a Super Sunday headliner that legitimately has enough going on to fill the next three days’ discourse. We won’t ask for anything ever again. Not until March anyway.",
      "We will grudgingly accept the reverse outcome – as we would with Spurs-United, to be fair – if it’s large and compelling and above all funny enough. But it really does feel like Spurs and Liverpool are our best crisis bets this weekend, the sheer futility of trying to predict what Chelsea might get up to having now been firmly established.",

We really shouldn’t just be assuming Arsenal definitely beat them, even though assuming Arsenal definitely beat pretty much anyone feels entirely fair at this point what with the twin superpowers of never facing any shots on their own goal and always scoring at least one p*ss-boiling set-piece at the other.",
      "But maybe the chaotic and unexpected energy of Sunderland is just the thing to derail the serene Mikel Arteta machine. And for our own something-to-fill-the-void requirements, the greater the prominence of Granit Xhaka in any such spanner-in-the-works behaviour the better.",

      "There’s no avoiding it, all we can hope to do is to mitigate the extent of the nonsense. And we reckon the best chance is if Tuchel does pick him this time.",
      "Because if Bellingham is in the squad, at least the Bellingham Week stories that follow will have to make some kind of superficial nod to real-world events that actually happen rather than the press pack having completely free rein to just make up the narrative.",

First, Bellingham will need to play some part in the games and be quite good but not too good. If he’s conspicuously good or conspicuously bad, it’s all too easy for it to naturally become the dominant narrative anyway. Bellingham isn’t really a footballer who does ‘quietly effective’ but we are really going to need him to try.",
      "And if that can happen with the barest minimum of any accompanying behaviour that can be spun as Billy Big Bollocks antics, again it would really help.",
      "Obviously, there’s no actual proper solution here. Anything he does (or doesn’t do) will still constitute a display of true colours or the speaking of volumes but the more egregiously the media has to reach for it the better. Don’t be giving them any ammunition.",

      "After an inconsistent start to the season, which mirrored much of their form from the previous campaign, Man Utd seem to have potentially turned a corner under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have won three and drawn one of their last four Premier League matches as they have moved up the table into eighth and one point behind defending champions Liverpool, who occupy third position.",

      "Despite their recent good form, Neville still reckons four players “should be doing a lot better” to hold the Man Utd team together.",
      "Neville told The Overlap and Betfair’s Stick to Cricket show: “I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man United, our spine was (Peter) Schmeichel, (Steve) Bruce, (Gary) Pallister, (Roy) Keane and (Eric) Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",

      "“That’s why I think Liverpool are good because they’ve got Alisson, (Virgil) van Dijk, they’ve got (Alexis) Mac Allister and (Ryan) Gravenberch in midfield and then they’ve got obviously the centre-forwards that they’ve got.”",

It is literally impossible to keep up, but suffice to say there now really are only a very small handful of managers considered entirely safe.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 15 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former now, though.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",

The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raises the stakes. Feels like a really big week for Frank now with key home games in Europe and the Premier League to come before the interlull.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, and he’ll have been enormously grateful Spurs were so thoroughly wretched on Saturday evening.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table after 10 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis reached full-blown levels before Saturday’s much-needed win over Aston Villa, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It was six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competitions before they stopped the rot against Villa. It was a result that really was sorely needed to prevent the genuine possibility of something truly extraordinary happening to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season.",
      "",
      "That was a very, very good time to face Wolves, and Marco Silva took full advantage to end a losing run that was just beginning to tip him and Fulham towards trouble. We remain convinced of this: Fulham and Silva are both better off with each other than without, and both parties would do well to pause before thinking of doing anything rash.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re only just at one-quarter distance this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s miserable trio managed.",

But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed despite a decent point against resurgent Manchester United.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, he desperately needed a statement performance and result to suggest he might be in possession of possible solutions. The win against Newcastle provided exactly that and surely buys him some time at least.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover.",

      "Chelsea are chief among them but plenty of other sides are indulging in the practice. These are the upcoming transfers sorted for future windows involving Premier League clubs.",
      "",
      "Tottenham really are going to have some team a few managers from now. Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall became grey-haired, grizzled veterans after pulling through an injury crisis for Ange Postecoglou, and they will soon be showing the likes of Melia the ropes for Thomas Frank’s successor.",
      "They will have to wait a little while for Melia, whose move as the League of Ireland’s record sale cannot be officially ratified until he turns 18 because Brexit. That’s so long, in fact, that said Irish transfer record has already been broken again.",
      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",

      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",

      "And Spanish publication Sport claims that Roque, who joined Palmeiras from Barcelona in February, is a top target for Man Utd with the Red Devils ‘closely monitoring the player and is prepared to make a €50 million offer.’",

      "Still only 20, Roque ‘prioritises finishing his contract with Palmeiras until June and would then be more open to a new adventure as long as there is a financial agreement between the parties’.",

The Barça sporting management believes they weren’t patient enough with the player during a difficult time, but now the priority is to generate future revenue from the player’s rights.",
      "‘For the moment, Barça could receive an additional one million euros as a variable payment if Vitor Roque wins the Copa Libertadores title.’",

      "Former Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is one of the main names being linked after the Red Devils attempted to sign him on loan from Atletico Madrid in the summer.",
      "And transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that there are currently no talks over signing Gallagher but Man Utd continue to monitor ahead of a potential loan move.",
      "Romano told GiveMeSport: “There’s no negotiation now. Gallagher remains one of the players monitored by Man United, as he was on the shortlist at the end of August. It will depend on what Atletico want to do, as they weren’t open to a loan move in August.”",
      "Earlier this week, Romano gave an update on what Man Utd fans can expect from their club ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Romano told his YouTube channel: “Ruben Amorim sends clear indications in public and in private for Manchester United in the January transfer window. In private, the conversations have started between Amorim, the board, and the management of Man Utd ahead of the January window.",
      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Man Utd are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Romano added: “But Amorim sends a clear message also in public talking about January. First of all, he says the window will be open and there is the possibility they will do something. So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",
      "“They already have several players. So, if someone joins in January, it will be a player who Man Utd can trust for the present but also for the future.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have submitted an ‘offer’ as they look to sign a former Barcelona star, while they are also eyeing Vinicius Junior."

      "Premier League • England",
      "Reports on the continent claim Liverpool are planning to spend a further £202m on three new signings in the January window to complete the rebuild of Arne Slot’s side – but TEAMtalk can explain why only one of the trio touted to sign is a realistic target.",
      "The Reds lavished some £440m (€505m, $600m) on rebuilding their squad over the summer, though several stars also left in a summer of sweeping changes for the Premier League champions. As is typical, though, for a side undergoing a serious transformation, Liverpool have taken time to find their best form and already find themselves some seven points adrift of table-topping Arsenal.",
      "But with the team still dogged by inconsistencies and having recently suffered six losses in seven games, Slot knows his side is far from perfect and still has many improvements to make if they are to challenge for major honours this season.",
      "To that end, notorious Spanish website Fichajes claims the Reds want to splash out another €230m (£202m, $265m) on stars from Real Madrid, Inter Milan and PSG, all in their sights.",
      "Per the report, the Reds are  ‘prepared to offer close to €60 million’ for Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "The France international is not the only midfielder on their agenda, either, with the report detailing interest in splashing out a further €90m on PSG midfielder Vitinha, who recently came third in the Ballon d’Or voting.",
      "‘Liverpool believes Vitinha could be the ideal addition to control the midfield. His price tag is around €90 million, a high figure but manageable within the club’s financial plan. His arrival would bring creativity, attacking prowess, and a high level of technical ability, precisely what the Anfield side is looking for to take a decisive step forward,’ the report claims.",
      "And to complete their winter window bonanza, it’s reported Liverpool see Alessandro Bastoni as the ‘ideal heir’ to Virgil van Dijk.",
      "The report continues: ‘The defence is also a focus of attention and the chosen player to reinforce it is Alessandro Bastoni, currently with Inter Milan and one of the most promising centre-backs in Europe.",
      "‘At just 25 years old, Bastoni combines power, tactical intelligence, and excellent ball distribution. Liverpool FC see him as the natural successor to Virgil van Dijk and are prepared to offer around €80 million to secure his services.’",
      "DON’T MISS 👉 Seven players hoping to catch the eye in Liverpool v Real Madrid amid transfer subplots",
      "Given Liverpool have just embarked on a major summer rebuild, it would seem madness to suggest they could splash out another £200m-plus on more new additions.",
      "And while their summer net spend was actually £218m, thanks to sales worth over £220m, it’s hard to take the report seriously given what Slot has said about further additions to his squad and his admission that money would only be splashed out if injuries were to dictate.",
      "Liverpool have lost one summer signing, Giovani Leoni, to a season-ending ACL injury, but speaking ahead of the 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace, Slot stated when asked if he could spend again: “That all depends on whether we get more injuries, yes or no, and if there’s a chance in the market – all the answers I always give.",
      "“But I would not prefer to go to 24/25 players. Also, if it is ever a situation where I lead a team that has four or five injuries throughout the whole season, it might be a bit smarter to go to 24/25, but recent history has shown that [we have a good record] until now.",
      "“We don’t have five or six injuries at the same time throughout the whole season. If that were the situation, then we would end up with 15/16 players, and that would normally be difficult.",
      "“So it’s a choice I like to make, but I think it is also a financial choice that we as a club have to make. If we want to keep these top players, we cannot have 24/25 of them.”",
      "Yet of those three, it is perhaps the injury to Leoni and uncertainty around the future of Ibrahima Konate that makes a possible move for Bastoni an intriguing prospect.",
      "The 40-times capped Italy defender has racked up 270 appearances for Inter and is now regarded as one of the best centre-halves, not just in Italy, but in world football.",
      "And he certainly has the type of credentials and qualities Liverpool would be after to improve their squad; indeed, he’s one of the few players in world football who could viably be seen as a suitable heir to Van Dijk.",
      "But whether Inter would sanction a mid-season sale would appear unlikely, especially given his fellow defenders Stefan de Vrij, 33, Francesco Acerbi, 37, and Matteo Darmian, 36, all having contracts expiring at the end of this season.",
      "To dismiss Fichajes’ other links, however, Liverpool do not need to add new midfielders to their mix with Slot blessed with a plethora of options.",
      "And while Vitinha, certainly, would be a significant upgrade on Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones, and, potentially, Ryan Gravenberch too, persuading PSG to part with one of their crown jewels is simply a non-starter.",
      "Meanwhile, Konate has sent a 12-word message to Liverpool fans ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League showdown with Real Madrid in a game being billed as the Frenchman’s transfer audition – but new reports in Spain suggest his poor form for the Reds has seen the Spanish giants accelerate moves for two other targets instead.",
      "Elsewhere, speculation is rife that Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has no intention of playing Liverpool loanee Harvey Elliott again, to avoid triggering a conditional obligation to buy clause.",
      "Finally, sources have addressed claims that Liverpool are starting to regret signing Milos Kerkez in the summer after the Hungarian’s early struggles to find his feet at Anfield, with our transfer correspondent, Dean Jones, revealing what the Reds’ future plans in the transfer market with regards their full-back department."

      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee has decided his preferred destination as he heads for a loan exit in the January transfer window, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Man Utd won three Premier League matches in a row for the first time under Amorim, while their 2-2 draw against Nottingham Forest at the weekend means they have now gained ten points from their last four games.",
      "Last season, the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League with only four sides scoring fewer goals than Man Utd.",
      "Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund came in for lots of criticism with the Man Utd pair scoring just seven Premier League goals between them.",
      "Hojlund left Old Trafford on a loan deal to Napoli over the summer and now Zirkzee looks likely to head out on loan in the January transfer window after falling down the pecking order.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",
      "The summer investment in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo has seen Netherlands international Zirkzee fail to start a match in all competitions this term.",
      "It seems almost certain that Zirkzee will leave in the summer and Spanish website Fichajes have claimed that Spanish side Sevilla have made a ‘request’ to loan the Dutchman.",
      "Reporter Matteo Moretto on Romano’s YouTube channel has revealed that Zirkzee is desperate to leave Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "It is also claimed that Zirkzee’s preferred destination would be a return to Italy with Serie A sides Roma and Como heavily linked to the Netherlands international.",
      "Speaking earlier this week, Romano gave an update on Man Utd’s plans for January with Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo attracting interest.",
      "Romano told his YouTube channel: “Ruben Amorim sends clear indications in public and in private for Manchester United in the January transfer window. In private, the conversations have started between Amorim, the board, and the management of Man Utd ahead of the January window.",
      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Man Utd are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Liverpool “never ever considered” replacing Arne Slot while the Reds were going through a terrible run of form.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Liverpool target Marc Guehi, while he “would not be surprised” by a January transfer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed what Man Utd are preparing to do in the January transfer window amid a turnaround in results under Ruben Amorim.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United target Lucas Paqueta leaving West Ham United is a “concrete possibility” and he is one to watch in the coming weeks.",
      "Every ‘Big Eight’ team has players who could leave in January, but we have picked out one star at each club who is the most likely to get a move…",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer should be ‘finalised soon’, while Fabrizio Romano reckons Ruben Amorim is keen to keep two players."

      "Fulham players Ryan Sessegnon and Harry Wilson both claimed their first Premier League manager scalp with goals in Vitor Pereira’s final Wolves game.",
      "The following is a rundown of the players who scored in a Premier League manager’s last game before losing their job. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester in which Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison were the scorers, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the Raphinha and Rodrigo-inspired loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "A total of 251 different players have induced one manager exit by scoring at least once in their final game. This number includes such names as Celestine Babayaro (Kenny Dalglish, Newcastle), Jon Flanagan (Andre Villas-Boas, Spurs), Vinnie Jones (Ron Atkinson, Aston Villa), Gary O’Neil (Peter Reid, Leeds), Arturo Vidal (Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea), and Harry Wilson, who helped put Vitor Pereira out of his Wolves misery.",

      "No club has been picked for more Premier League TV games than Manchester United, with a surprise team alongside them and ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Liverpool) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Sunderland) – £45m",
      "5th (Bournemouth) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Spurs) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Chelsea) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Manchester United) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Crystal Palace) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Brighton) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Aston Villa) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Brentford) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Newcastle) – £21.2m",

      "19th (Nottingham Forest) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Spurs and Sunderland were the biggest winners from the second December and first January selections with four more games each.",
      "Brighton, Burnley, West Ham and Wolves only had two more matches picked.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (18 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £15.4m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (17 games) – worth around £14.6m",
      "=8th) Manchester City and Newcastle (16 games) – worth around £13.7m",
      "10th) Leeds (15 games) – worth around £12.9m",
      "=11th) Brentford, Crystal Palace, Everton, Fulham and West Ham (13 games) – worth around £11.4m",

      "=17th) Bournemouth, Brighton and Sunderland (10 games) – worth around £8.9m",
      "20th) Burnley (8 games) – worth around £7.3m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold endured as difficult an Anfield return as could be imagined as Liverpool dominated Real Madrid and finally beat ‘that f**ker’.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario has soared to the top of this ranking having conceded just one from a PSxG of 3.2.",
      "",
      "Henderson had a serene afternoon against Brentford, dealing with the two shots allowed on his target to keep a first clean sheet in six. The Palace keeper will doubtless fancy himself as England’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. Of the ever-presents, only David Raya has conceded fewer goals.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds…",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A drop of 0.5 in his overall score after the 2-2 draw at Forest even if there is little the Belgian could have done to prevent either of the hosts’ goals.",
      "",
      "Still only David Raya has kept more clean sheets than Pope who, like the rest of the Newcastle team, did not have a good day at West Ham.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "No keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 84.2%, perhaps because Arsenal just don’t give up chances of any reasonable quality. The Spaniard has faced only one shot on target in the last four games.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "One of three keepers to keep out a penalty this season, Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as England’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are buzzing with their latest keeper plundered from the Chelsea stockpile, with Petrovic part of a completely revamped defence. Which has not been impenetrable. Only two keeper have faced more shots on target.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric during his last Prem appearance at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good in the first of their four consecutive Premier League defeats – before feeling a twang in the next game at Galatasaray.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Only three keepers have faced more shots on target so facing 10-man Wolves was some welcome respite for Leno.",
      "",
      "One of the biggest climbers this weekend, despite conceding three at Brighton. The first of which he left his goal unattended to close down when he might wish he’d stayed within his posts, and the third came after he gave the ball away in the build.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award has had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list, from a position of strength to somewhere a lot less competent. Conceding direct from a corner against Bournemouth and then from around 30 yards didn’t help his cause. Little Sels could do about either of Manchester United’s goals but Big John is still breathing down his neck.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence.",
      "",
      "Martinez began the season well but his form has tailed off. Mo Salah doesn’t often need a helping hand but Martinez provided the assist for Liverpool’s opener at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno. Though perhaps not for long.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he is currently keeping the wrong company down here.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow.",

      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",

      "The last club who felt compelled to sack their manager after losing to Marco Silva was transformed as a result; it might not work for Wolves but still.",
      "The following is a rundown of the clubs a Premier League coach faced last before losing their job, and the respective managers who were in charge of them. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",

      "From Ron Atkinson, who induced the first managerial sacking in Premier League history when Chelsea axed Ian Porterfield after a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in February 1993, to Oliver Glasner, who forced West Ham’s hand when Crystal Palace beat Graham Potter’s side in September 2025, 60 different coaches have proven to be the last straw for one Premier League manager.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided that one of their players has ‘no future’ at the club, while another is in ‘advanced’ exit talks.",
      "There was major upheaval at Man Utd in the summer and this was required after they finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "Regarding incomings, Ruben Amorim‘s side largely focused on overhauling their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also bought Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana as their No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Red Devils invested around £230m on these signings after raising funds via offloading unwanted assets, with Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund among those to leave.",
      "Man Utd hoped to sell Sancho to Chelsea in the summer, but their Big Six rivals paid a penalty fee to opt out of a permanent transfer and send him back to Old Trafford.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",
      "This left Sancho in limbo as he entered the final year of his contract at Man Utd, but he eventually joined Aston Villa on a straight loan deal.",
      "Man Utd have the option to extend Sancho’s deal on the same terms until 2027, so they are presumably hoping that his loan to Aston Villa can lead to a sale to them or another club.",
      "However, this currently looks really unlikely as Sancho has barely featured for Aston Villa and has done nothing when he’s been on the pitch.",
      "So, Sancho’s long-term future is likely to remain in doubt in the coming months and a report from Football Insider‘s Pete O’Rourke claims Man Utd’s stance on the winger is that he has ‘no future’ at Old Trafford.",
      "O’Rourke explained: “I don’t think there’s a long-term future for Sancho in Manchester in any way.",
      "“He was part of that bomb squad in the summer that they were looking to get rid of and they were more than happy for him to go to Aston Villa.",
      "“I don’t see any way back in the long-term at Man United. And as I said, with no break clause in that loan deal, it seems that Sancho will stay at Villa and he’ll be hoping between now and the rest of season he can make an impact and win favour with Unai Emery.”",
      "It is also looking as if Kobbie Mainoo will leave Man Utd in the coming months, with a report on Monday morning claiming that the Red Devils have ‘opened the door’ to his loan to Serie A giants Napoli.",
      "Now, a report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Mainoo is currently in ‘advanced’ exit talks.",
      "The report added: ‘Kobbie Mainoo’s January exit from Manchester United has edged closer to reality, with Napoli aggressively pushing a loan proposal that could finally crack Ruben Amorim’s resolve, TEAMtalk understands.",
      "‘Sources confirm the Serie A leaders are prepared to cover the 20-year-old’s £45,000-a-week wages in full and insert a purchase option – terms designed to tempt Old Trafford into releasing their academy jewel mid-season.’",

      "Man Utd won three games in a row for the first time under Amorim recently before a 2-2 draw on the road at Nottingham Forest took their unbeaten run to four matches in the Premier League.",
      "When asked what he’s made of Amorim’s first year in charge, Sharpe exclusively told Football365 on behalf of Adventure Games: “Yeah, I think a little bit indifferent and up and down. I think we’ve seen flashes of brilliance and flashes of not such good stuff. But I think we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I think we’re seeing his system, his philosophy, coming into effect.",
      "“I think that they’re creating a lot of chances and not quite putting enough away at the moment, but dominating teams like like he was hoping to do early on, but just didn’t.",

      "When asked what the target should be for Man Utd this season, Sharpe added: “I think top four is a realistic goal. I think the last couple of weeks, with the results they’ve had beaten Liverpool away, a good win against Brighton, who are a bit of a tricky team and a bit of a bogey team for United at home, and won that comfortably.",
      "“A little bit disappointed against Forest, but again, creating chances with Forest with the new manager and the new manager sort of lifts, I think it was always going to be a tricky game.",
      "“So to be unbeaten in the last four is a real bonus and a real confidence builder for the team. And I think that’s what, that’s what the team needs now. The fans need a bit of confidence that they can put a string of results together.",
      "“And they don’t have this sort of high and low and high and low, this roller coaster ride that’s been going on for the last 12 months.",
      "“And I think we can, like I say, we can see a little bit of that coming now, and the more results they can put together, the more that confidence grows. And I think top four can be a realistic place to look.”",

      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 16:40, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 14th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",

      "Dermot Gallagher reveals all as he examines incidents from across the weekend, including Amad's late equaliser at Nottingham Forest, Onana and Mac Allister's penalty box incident, Donnarumma's complaints after Bournemouth hit back and Bentancur's challenge on James",
      "Monday 3 November 2025 11:37, UK",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher is back with the latest Ref Watch after a busy weekend of incidents, including Manchester United's dubious goal from a corner at Nottingham Forest.",
      "INCIDENT: Man Utd's first goal comes after a dubious corner is awarded. Corner complaints for Forest for the second week running - why won't VAR intervene for corners?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Why has the referee made that judgment? I don't know, because if the ball does go out and he doesn't see it, I can understand that, because he has got two goal posts there.",
      "\"He's got a goalkeeper, he's got [Nicolo] Savona himself in front of him, but he's made a judgment from 75 - 80 yards, incorrectly. You know, he's probably thought it's gone out, but it hasn't.",
      "\"The referee, I feel for as that depth, you're not going to see. If it hit the line like that, you wouldn't give a goal.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"The ball's definitely not gone out, and the fact that the linesman has made a judgment call from about, what, 70 yards. The referee was closer. I know he's a bit of a different angle, but the referee was definitely closer.",
      "\"It's just too far to say. But again, this is twice in two weeks now and I'm thinking to myself, well, there's goal line technology.",
      "\"Maybe that can be used across the whole byline, but then obviously, they can't change the rules this year, but it's definitely something they need to look at for next year, because it will cost teams ultimately.",
      "\"I think you can look at that in 10 seconds, and it will be cleared up and there will be no debate. They have enough time to look at that and make a decision.\"",
      "INCIDENT: The ball strikes Patrick Dorgu on the arm in the build-up to Amad's equaliser at Forest, but the goal stands.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It strikes his arm on the way through, but the rule is, has he scored? No, so he is not penalised for that.",
      "\"Is it deliberate? No, it brushes his arm on the way through, so it is not a deliberate play, so the game goes on, it gets cleared and he shoots.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Amadou Onana grabs Alexis Mac Allister by the throat in the penalty area while attacking a corner - why just a yellow?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The fact they were pushing and shoving each other and all right, he's raised his arm, probably a bit higher than he wanted, but he's pushing.",
      "\"Stuart's got to decide, is it violent? Is it an act of brutality? He said: 'No,' he's obviously relayed to the VAR what he's seen, VAR has checked it back. The referee said, yellow card only.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"As much as I like a physical game, I look at this situation, I'm like, if someone puts their hand on my throat in the street like that, you're gonna get an aggressive reaction from me.",
      "\"So in that instance, I'm saying that should be a red card, because obviously Mac Allister can't do that, right? Mac Allister has made the most of it. He's gone down, right? And that's probably because if he reacts, he'll get a red card too.",
      "\"So I think he's gone down there, and obviously, it's something that the official should have picked up.",
      "\"But I look at that and I say that is aggressive, because again, I reiterate, if that happens off the football pitch and someone does that to you, you're going to react in a certain way, which probably be aggressive, or you're going to call HR!\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gianluigi Donnarumma complained he was held by David Brooks as Bournemouth netted an equaliser from a corner at Man City.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I thought it was a goal. I've seen refs take a much different approach. It's not a good punch. I don't think the forward does much wrong.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If you look at Donnarumma, it looks like it's not affecting him that much.",
      "\"When you look at all the players in the box, they're all nudging each other. There is contact. There is, you know, how many people are in the box? There are 20 players in there, so I don't understand why keepers want more protection.",
      "\"He's six foot seven, and his span upwards would probably be about nine feet. I don't understand why he's complaining there.",
      "\"He's complaining because he's punched that, but it's a bad punch and a goal has come of it. It's definitely not a foul. And I think keepers, again, I feel like they get too much protection, and in that scenario, for the referee, fantastic decision.",
      "\"He should be commanding that area more. The only person I've seen say it was a foul is Guardiola. What are we saying now? It's a non-contact sport.",
      "\"Brooks has definitely not fouled him. The referees have been consistent about this, and I think it's been good.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Rodrigo Bentancur avoids red for a tough challenge on Reece James.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think this is one of them. If he gets sent off, VAR is not bringing him back. I think it's more red than a yellow card.",
      "\"But I can understand the yellow on field. I think VAR is going to back the decision.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If he does get a red card there, I say, I understand why he got it, but then after that, I can understand as well why it's a yellow card. It's an aggressive challenge. It's one of those orange card challenges.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez is only shown a yellow card despite a studs-up high challenge on Spurs midfielder Joao Palhinha.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I definitely do not think this is a red card, his feet are up and it is a glancing blow, he has not gone through him, it is almost sideways. If he was in front and had gone through like that, he is in big trouble, but because of the angle he comes in at, he does not get the force or contact and so does not make the impact.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"I really like this decision from the ref. Enzo has tried to make an honest challenge there and just toe the ball away and as he has toe the ball away, his foot is obviously up, but his foot has hit the side of Palhinha's knee, so in that instance, it is not a reckless tackle, or a high challenge. From certain angles and a high speed, it looks a red.\"",
      "INCIDENT: West Ham have a penalty overturned by the VAR after it was deemed Malick Thiaw had got a touch on the ball first in his challenge with Jarrod Bowen.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Yes [right decision made], but I will also say when I first saw it I thought penalty, so I can understand why the referee [Robert Jones] first gave a penalty. When I saw the first replay, I knew it would be overturned.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"He has not touched the ball enough, the ball has not even changed speed, it is so minute that it should be given as a penalty, it is a crazy decision.",
      "\"You cannot say every time that you touch the ball it is not a penalty. He blocked Bowen from getting to the ball, so it is a penalty!\"",
      "The decision took over three minutes - was that too long?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It was quite protracted and that is why I do not want to see more intrusion [by the VAR], it can be slicker.\"",

      "Is he good enough? Is he scoring enough? Is he doing enough?",
      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",
      "Gyokeres struck the opener from a corner as Mikel Arteta's side also improved on their league-leading set-piece goals tally before the striker's brilliant pass freed Leandro Trossard in the build up to Declan Rice's superb header.",
      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",
      "Gyokeres' injury will now be the concern for Arsenal - as will concerns over Martin Zubimendi, who was replaced in the second half.",
      "With Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Jesus still out after long-term injuries, the Gunners can't afford to lose much more quality, especially in the centre-forward position.Oliver Yew",
      "Sometimes this job is a real privilege. Watching Moises Caicedo up close was a real thrill - even the Tottenham fans would have to agree. This was a performance that showcased everything you want from a world-class midfielder. Tenacious, intelligent, full of quality and affecting the game in the final third. Jamie Redknapp called him \"world class, perhaps the best of his type in world football.\"",
      "It's hard to argue.",
      "The £115m price tag had seemed to hang around his neck like a glittering weight in his early days at Chelsea but we're now seeing the player that bulldozed opposition players at Brighton.",
      "There's something N'Golo Kanté-esque about him, not just in engine or energy, but in humility. He doesn't crave the spotlight, he craves the ball. And when he gets it, the whole game dances to his tune. Xavi Simons looked almost frightened at times to dribble near the Chelsea enforcer such was the domination in the duels.",
      "He has that fear factor now. And that's one of the main reasons why he's the best in the world at what he does.Lewis Jones",
      "To beat Tottenham looks simple at the moment: defend set pieces properly and you're onto a winner. Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",
      "For his and Wolves' sake, let's hope he finds it soon…Rich Morgan",
      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end.Adam Bate",

      "With nine minutes to play and Forest looking comfortable, Amad cracked in a super left-foot strike when Nikola Milenkovic's header fell to him on the edge of the box. He then thought he'd hit a 94th-minute winner only to be denied by a goalline block by Murillo, capping a game packed with drama.",
      "United had led at half-time through a controversial Casemiro opener which sparked fury around the City Ground. The officials had awarded a corner when replays did not conclusively show all of the ball had crossed the line and the Brazilian subsequently headed in.",
      "\"It's not out,\" said former Premier League referee Mike Dean on Soccer Saturday. \"The ball is nowhere near out. It's just a guess by the referee.\"",
      "Forest had conceded from a corner which should have been given as a goal-kick at Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Afterwards, Forest boss Sean Dyche called for a review of the rules, with VAR currently unable to intervene in those situations. \"We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR,\" he said. \"Why's it not brought in?",
      "\"Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",
      "Forest were fuelled by the injustice on Saturday, with Morgan Gibbs-White brilliantly heading in an equaliser three minutes into the second half before Nicolo Savona - who had been the player judged unable to keep the ball in for the controversial corner - pounced to prod in Forest's second.",

Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",

      "\"I think we dropped the energy level. You can feel it when our team is not at the top of their energy and aggression. You can feel it. We managed to score again, we tried to win the game, we had a big opportunity in the end. We missed that little bit of luck. We need to work to bring the same away from home as we do in our stadium.",
      "\"We are getting better. Everyone can see. We are getting that feeling that if we can't win, at least we aren't going to lose. The way we press, the urgency with certain things, I think we did better last Sunday. We need to be like that in every game.\"",
      "On Amad's equaliser: \"It's something good for the fans. It was a really important goal for us. But I'm more focused on the 90 minutes. And what we did good. That's what I'll tell the players. Sometimes I forget that part and I judge the players when I see the games. But, we are doing things right. We are controlling the game. Of course we can do so much to grow. But there are a lot of things we are doing right.",
      "\"The good thing is I can see so much more potential to do better things. If you combine those two things, we are progressing.\"",

      "Manchester United have won five of their last seven Premier League games and sit sixth; Ruben Amorim is enjoying his best spell at United after finishing 15th last season and losing in the Europa League final; United face Nottingham Forest on Saturday",
      "Saturday 1 November 2025 14:06, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has admitted he questioned his future at Manchester United during his first year at the club.",
      "Amorim will mark his one-year anniversary since agreeing to become the club's head coach on Saturday as United visit Nottingham Forest looking to strengthen their challenge for a place in the Premier League's top four.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has endured a difficult 12 months since arriving from Sporting, finishing 15th, losing in the Europa League final and winning only one of the first five games this season - which left him wondering if he would make it to a year in charge.",
      "\"It's hard to say that. Sometimes, in some moments,\" he said. \"There were some moments that were tough to deal with, to lose so many games. That was so hard for me because this is Manchester United.",
      "\"The position that we had in the last year, putting all the attention on the Europa League and not winning. That was massive. I had some moments that I struggled a lot and I was thinking that maybe it's not meant to be.",
      "\"Today is the opposite. So you can write this one. Today I feel and I know that was the best decision in my life. I want to be here but for that I need to win against Nottingham Forest.\"",
      "Amorim is enjoying his best period at the club with United winning five of their last seven league games, including victories over Chelsea and Liverpool, to put themselves in the mix to qualify for Europe.",
      "However, he is not prepared to declare that the tough times have now passed.",
      "\"It's hard to say. We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is [up and down]. And we are not that team that I can say to you, no, no, no.",
      "\"Now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust in my players more. I think they trust me more. That will come with wins. And you can sense that because everyone now is saying that, how connected they are and they believe in the manager.",
      "\"It's about winning games. It didn't change a lot because against Arsenal, I saw the same team, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think that we are in a better place, but it's also really good to be always with that feeling and prepare that something can change. If we have that feeling, we'll pay attention to the details and we'll maintain that course of our path.",

      "While out of work in August, Dyche said: \"I may get hammered for it, but I bet I could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2.\"",
      "The former Everton boss did also go on to say Amorim should get time to continue his work at the club.",
      "On Thursday, Amorim said: \"First of all, maybe it is true that if we play in a 4-4-2 we won more games. But I always say that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while and then in the future it is going to be better.",
      "\"We don't know that. I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don't say very strong things, I don't want to watch you. I am the same.",
      "\"I can completely understand that it is a different job. I know Sean Dyche is smart and he knows how to play the game.",
      "\"He understands that there is one thing seeing the game and talking about it. It is another thing to coach a team.\"",
      "Dyche, also speaking on Thursday, said he didn't question Amorim as a person and that \"clickbait kills everything, it changes the whole story\".",
      "He added: \"They said, 'What would be a fair timeline?' and I said, 'Half a season to continue the work he was doing' but unfortunately, that doesn't make the story, we all know that.",
      "\"For the points tally, I was suggesting maybe the basics would have worked better. They have changed their style, fair play to him, his coaching staff, the players. They have changed their style, not necessarily their beliefs, but just their style.",
      "\"They are being a bit quicker to play forwards and longer, a bit tighter and getting back into their shape. That's management, that's coaching.",
      "\"That doesn't mean he's changed his whole philosophy, it just means he's adapting it to the challenge that's right in front of him. Fair play to him.\"",
