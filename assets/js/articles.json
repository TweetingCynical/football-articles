      "Ange Postecoglou launched a furious attack on his critics ahead of the Europa League final, declaring: “I’m no clown.”",
      "Asked in the final media conference ahead of Spurs’ showdown with Manchester United in Bilbao if he was conscious of a ‘fine line between two different types of infamy and history’, an angry Postecoglou responded: “I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and never will be.",
      "\"You really disappointed me that you (the reporter’s publication) used such terminology to describe a person that for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he is leading out a club in a European final.",
      "\"For you to suggest that somehow us not being successful means that I'm a clown, I'm not sure how to answer that question …”",
      "The final against United will be Postecoglou’s 100th game in charge of Spurs and most observers expect it to be his penultimate match in charge. Spurs will wrap up their season against Brighton on the final day of the Premier League on Sunday.",
      "At times in Bilbao, Postecoglou gave hints that he knows he is very unlikely to be in charge next season but said that talk about his future was “irrelevant”.",
      "He did, however, claim his long-term Spurs project is still on track, saying: “I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we are building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there is a lot of work to be done. That is quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, but I think there is some reasoning in the context of that but also there has been some growth that I would like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not, that's not important right now but I don't think this job is finished. I feel like there is some growth there that we can take this club where it needs to be.\""

      "Bruno Fernandes' desire to play through the pain barrier for Manchester United was best summed up by his efforts during a clash against Fulham in last year's Premier League - a contest won by the Cottagers.",
      "Harry Maguire's goal in the 89th minute looked to have salvaged a point only for Alex Iwobi to score in the seventh minute of injury time. But it was Fernandes' ability and motivation to play the entire game that really left some of the club's staff stunned. The Portuguese playmaker was subjected to a nasty tackle, hitting his ankle hard.",
      "The Telegraph reports that the challenge left his ankle looking like a “f***ing melon”. Another individual claimed it was “so swollen it looked like it had been operated on”. The loss seemingly adding insult to injury.",
      "Those at the club were already preparing for the FA Cup fifth round tie with Nottingham Forest without him. The trip to the City Ground was in just four days, but Fernandes, having pushed through the pain barrier, set about his recovery.",
      "A member of staff remembers being due to leave Carrington around 5pm one night that week before seeing a person from a distance hobbling from the ice bath to the jacuzzi. It was Fernandes. The skipper had been in there for two hours, moving from one to the next in a cycle of so-called “contrast bath therapy” as he tried to reduce the swelling and improve his chances of playing.",
      "United, en route to shocking Manchester City in the final to win the FA Cup, managed to beat the Nottingham outfit thanks to an 89th minute goal from Casemiro. Fernandes would play the entire game despite his injury issues leading up to the clash.",
      "A year on and the former Sporting Lisbon ace has continued to be the talismanic figure that has carried the team in what has been another poor season. Last season United finished eighth, their worst finish in the Premier League era, but currently sit 16th with one game of the campaign remaining.",
      "Fernandes' durability is among his greatest qualities and he's produced one of his best seasons in front of goal. He's closing in on 40 goal involvements with two games of his season remaining. Al-Hilal have made the United man one of their main targets this summer, but Amorim has maintained he's going nowhere.",
      "He said: \"I want Bruno here because we want to win the Premier League again, so we want the best players to continue with us. He's 30, but he's still so young, because he plays 55 games every season. Between assists and goals, he's there for 30 at least, so he's the type of player we want here and he's not going anywhere.\""

      "The ex-Manchester City man has scored 12 times, leading the line impressively, with United and Chelsea now both keen on the 22-year-old, who has a £30million release clause.",
      "ESPN reports that Delap will almost certainly head to Manchester if they win the Europa League - which would grant them a path into the Champions League. Defeat though would leave them without European football and bring the Blues into the equation.",
      "Chelsea are admirers and can secure Champions League football on the final day of the season. Worst way they will be in Europe in some form - the tournament yet to be confirmed.",
      "United have made Delap their primary target in the final third - ahead of both Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen. However no European football when it comes to negotiations would see Chelsea become the favourites to sign the Ipswich man.",
      "Delap only moved to Ipswich from City for £15m back in the summer. Those at the Etihad have the option to re-sign him for £40m, but they have no interest in doing so leaving Chelsea and those on the red side of Manchester to battle it out for his signature.",
      "Executives from Manchester have held face-to-face talks with Delap. The club have the finances to sign Delap and Cunha regardless of how the Europa League final goes as Amorim's overhaul begins.",
      "The Red Devils have already made moves to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for just over £60m with that transfer currently progressing. Amorim needs to add considerable quality to his attack with the likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both struggling."

      "But with the outcome of Wednesday night’s Europa League final, which offers a route into next season’s Champions League, set to determine how much money is available to spend this summer, Ferdinand believes club chiefs must get busy without belong able to carry out the major surgery required in one go.",

I don't think he'd want a massive, massive overhaul that quick. “He'd like to be in a perfect case scenario where he takes 10 out and gets 10 in. But I don't see that being realistic, to be honest.”",
      "Ferdinand can see no convincing argument for Amorim to abandon his 3-4-2-1 system, insisting that the issue remains players who do not have the attributes required to execute what their coach exactly wants.",
      "And while he believes United players have been “fighting all season” to ensure they are part of Amorim’s plans come August, it will not be until a few weeks into next season before those who are still in the squad can be sure of their standing.",

      "Ravel Morrison has claimed Wilfried Zaha didn't return to the changing room after the ex-England U21 duo's infamous clash on the pitch. In March 2013, the Young Lions cruised to a 5-0 home victory over Lithuania in what was a routine and otherwise uneventful win.",
      "That was until Morrison and Zaha were suddenly at each other's throats on the pitch, in front of television cameras and stunned spectators. During a brief break in play, Zaha could be seen exchanging words with Morrison as both sets of players looked to get back in position.",
      "After taking exception to something Zaha said, Morrison turned around and pushed his former Manchester United youth team-mate, prompting the ex-Crystal Palace forward to furiously shove him back. Former Southampton winger Nathan Redmond intervened, ensuring the scuffle did not turn into a full-blown fight.",
      "In 2021, Zaha, who now represents the Ivory Coast and plays club football for Charlotte in the MLS, claimed he was angry with what he perceived to be selfish play from his team-mate. Morrison, 32, who now plays for Precision FC in Dubai, hit out at Zaha, claiming their physical exchange has been blown out of proportion by the media and his ex-team-mate.",
      "When asked if it was heated in the changing room, Morrison told Undr The Cosh podcast: \"No. He didn’t come into the changing room after that, but there was no back and forth or anything after that. There was nothing. The conversation was done.",
      "\"It happened on the pitch and it stayed on the pitch. There was nothing in the changing room, there was no awkwardness or anything. You can ask all the U21s that was there. There was nothing in the changing room after. I’ve never understood it really.”",
      "In 2021, Zaha, providing his side of what happened, told the On the Judy podcast: \"He (Morrison) was just getting me mad. He was moving like he was Ronaldinho and the rest of us were just no one.",
      "\"He was getting the ball and he was just doing tricks and the only time he passes it is if he really needs to. We're just stood there with our hands on our hips while he's going past six Lithuanian players. And it's just like, 'What are you doing?’",
      "\"It was that easy - the team that we had, we had such good players and we can all do that, we can all hog the ball and go past all of them but we're not doing it. We're trying to be professional, play properly, but he was just on his own thing.",
      "\"I just had enough. I was like, 'What are you doing?' And out of the blue he just pushed me. I'm like, 'Are you dumb?’ So I pushed him back and it was just nonsense on the pitch. Then when you go inside, the man is silent.\"",
      "Morrison responded to Zaha's comments in 2021 by asking him to discuss their exchange on a podcast. Addressing what Zaha said four years ago, Morrison added: \"I think that thing (the scuffle) was blown out of proportion.",
      "\"I think even from his side, he’s come out and done something after it again. It was never that deep. Me and Saido Berahino, we were both on two goals. Obviously, you shouldn’t really do it, but the game had like 15 minutes left.",
      "\"We were talking and saying, 'Who can get the hat-trick?’ We were both trying to get a hat-trick, so I think I hit one outside the area and, from there, it just tipped him over the water. Even in that game, there was no, 'Oh, pass me the ball.’ It was like that one split-second in the game.”",

      "But while their league campaign has been a write-off, Ruben Amorim's side can salvage something from the ruins by beating Tottenham to win the Europa League final.",
      "Despite the depths United have plumbed this season, United's fans have continued to back Ruben Amorim and his players, with Maguire admitting their enduring loyalty has surprised them.",
      "“They've been absolutely incredible this season,” said Maguire. “It's surprising us players how much they're backing us. We've disappointed them far too much. We've given them some good times in the Europa League and some great memories in terms of winning the derby at the Etihad, but it’s even surprised me.",
      "“I say they're the greatest fans in the world and I think this year they’ve proved that. It’s been remarkable when we get to play in front of them, even though we're not performing.",
      "“That's why I think they deserve it, and we deserve everything we do to give them the great opportunity to go and win the cup final and give them that day out. It’s only a good day out if we come back and win the tournament.",
      "“We know this season has been nowhere near good enough for this club and for our standards. Next season, I know we'll improve.”",
      "Maguire has had rotten luck with United when it comes to finals – injured for the Europa League final defeat to Villarreal in 2021 and also ruled out of last season's FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "The England defender was also an unused substitute in United's FA Cup final defeat to City in 2023 and only played two minutes when they won the League Cup in the same season, under former boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "“Missing the Villarreal one was a big one for me,” said Maguire. “I was captain of the club at the time and a big part of that team. Maybe the result would have been different if I'd been in the team. That's what I felt. I missed last year as well. I was playing every week under Eric and missed the final, so it hurt.",
      "“But the lads put in a great performance. It makes it a lot better when you win. The Villarreal one hurt a lot more than the cup final, just because of the result.",
      "“At the time of the Villarreal final I was an important part of the team. We had a good team that year and played really well. We had a good defensive record but I had a nasty ankle injury.",
      "“Looking back to that game, I actually think we played pretty well. We were unlucky not to win and it's nice to get another opportunity against Spurs in another final. We'll be ready for it.”",
      "Maguire has enjoyed a revival under Amorim and will start in the centre of defence tonight, capping a remarkable turnaround for the 32-year-old, who nearly left United after having the captaincy taken off him by Ten Hag in the summer of 2023.",
      "But Maguire has shown impressive mental resilience to re-establish himself as automatic pick and scored the 121st-minute winner in United's epic quarter-final comeback against Lyon.",
      "“You want to be in these big games, these big moments, pressure moments,” said Maguire. “You want to play and be part of it. “It’s been a couple of years now and I feel in a good place. I feel really comfortable at this club and my surroundings and the pressure that’s involved in it. It’s an amazing club and I’m really privileged and proud to be a part of it.”"

      "Despite losing his United place and seeing team-mate Bruno Fernandes handed the captaincy, Maguire remained a key figure for England under Southgate. Southgate kept faith with Maguire and the defender said the backing of the former Three Lions boss helped him win back his place and form for United.",
      "\"I always believed, because I was always playing for my country in major tournaments,\" said Maguire, who will start Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao. \"I went to the World Cup in Qatar and played a big part in reaching a quarter-final, and played and performed really well.",
      "\"Really the belief that came from me, maybe at that time, was playing for my country. Credit to Gareth for showing his faith and trust in me during that period. I must say I felt like I was playing really well for my country, even through negative times at this club.",
      "\"It's nice to be back playing. It's nice to be back helping the team. The most important thing is it's a big cup final, and one I'm looking forward to.\"",

      "\"To play in a European final for Manchester United is a huge occasion. Our fans deserve it - they've been absolutely incredible this season. I don't know how and why they're sticking with us as much as they are, because we've disappointed them so many times.",
      "\"But they've stuck with us and they deserve something to celebrate. It's going to be a great day for them, but it'll only be a great day if we go and lift that trophy. It's going to be a good game, a tough game, we know that Spurs will be right up for it as well, but it's one I'm looking forward to.\""

      "Wednesday night's Europa League final is expected to have a notable bearing on the future of Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres as Arsenal and Manchester United continue to probe for the highly-coveted Swede's services. The 26-year-old, who has scored 53 goals and also registered 13 assists in 51 appearances this season in Portugal, is one of Europe's hottest commodities and the race for his signature is expected to intensify as early as next week. Gyokeres is gearing up for his Sporting farewell on Sunday when he intends to sign off in style against Benfica in the Taça de Portugal final after already capturing his second successive Primeira Liga title last weekend. And while the ex-Brighton, Swansea City and Coventry City frontman is yet to confirm he'll be leaving Sporting this summer, the decision has already been made and there is a gentleman's agreement in place which will allow Gyokeres to depart for a package worth in the region of £60million.",
      "Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta considers Gyokeres the perfect fit for Mikel Arteta's project and a marquee No.9 is actively considered a transfer priority for the Gunners. It's currently unclear whether Gyokeres is Arsenal's primary target - there is also huge admiration for Newcastle's Alexander Isak and Benjamin Sesko - but Manchester United are also interested in Gyokeres and at this moment in time, it currently looks like a two-horse race. The Sporting hotshot wants to win trophies and compete at the highest level in the Champions League and if United fail to qualify for Europe's elite club competition next season, Arsenal will be well placed to beat their rivals to the punch should they decide to pursue a deal. United are already on course to seal the £62.5m signing of Wolves ' Matheus Cunha and they've also been speaking to Ipswich striker Liam Delap, however, given Gyokeres formed a close bond with Ruben Amorim during their time together in Lisbon, a move to Old Trafford is not yet out of the question. But their project is a difficult sell without Champions League football given they're currently floundering in 16th place in the Premier League and Arsenal are seemingly well equipped to continue competing for the top prizes, despite falling short this season.",
      "Gyokeres turns 27 this summer, is entering his prime and now he's had a taste of silverware and Champions League football in Portugal, he does not want to waste time. Trophies, goals and records are what drive him and while you cannot underestimate the size and stature of United, Gyokeres looks like the missing piece of the puzzle for Arsenal and the kind of acquisition that could help them over the line next season. The Red Devils are also under significant financial strain and will need to sell once the Cunha deal has been processed in order to continue spending. Meanwhile, Arsenal are armed with huge cash and if United fail to beat Tottenham in Bilbao, it's clear the Gunners will be in pole position to land the red-hot Swede, if they wish to press the button."

      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has sent his well wishes to the team ahead of their Europa League final against Tottenham on Wednesday night. Ruben Amorim's men have flown out to Bilbao hoping to round off their disastrous season with silverware, which would also secure passage to the Champions League.",
      "United have already picked up one win at the Estadio de San Mames after beating Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals and now their Premier League rivals stand in their way of yet another European trophy. Amorim has insisted victory would not save their season after falling to 16th in the table following 18 losses.",
      "The Red Devils posted a photo reel on their Instagram page sharing the thoughts of some United players on the upcoming final, including Alejandro Garnacho, Amad Diallo, Patrick Dorgu and Christian Eriksen.",
      "Rashford replied to the post, simply writing: \"Good luck guys,\" followed by a star emoji. The England forward has spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Aston Villa after falling out with Amorim and has impressed, scoring four goals and assisting five.",
      "However, his season came to an early end after he picked up a hamstring injury, with his last game being Villa's 2-1 defeat to Manchester City - in which he scored.",
      "His setback forced him out of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup semi-final loss to Crystal Palace, with the player returning to United's training ground for an injury assessment.",
      "Rashford is unlikely to play for United again while Amorim is manager, after the Portuguese coach criticised his work ethic in training.",
      "He infamously scolded Rashford, claiming he would rather name his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital on the bench rather than someone who \"does not give the maximum\".",
      "Villa have an option to buy Rashford for around £40million, but it remains to be seen whether they will activate it. The move has further complications, with United likely to be forced to pay off the rest of his contract.",
      "Rashford has played 426 times for the Red Devils after joining as a seven-year-old, scoring 138 goals and winning a total of five major trophies during that time.",
      "The 27-year-old himself has experience of winning the Europa League after starting in United's 2-0 win over Ajax in the 2017 final.",
      "However, he has also experienced the agony of losing such a final. He also started the 2021 final against Villarreal, which finished 1-1 after extra time before United lost on penalties."

      "His performances in France have attracted interest from a range of top clubs. He has become a reliable goalscorer for Lille, helping to fire them to the Ligue 1 title back in 2021.",
      "The 25-year-old has decided the time is right to move on from Stade Pierre-Mauroy. With a record of 109 goals in 232 games, he is sure to be a prime target for several top sides, especially given he is a free agent.",
      "Manchester United and Arsenal have both been linked with him, as the Premier League rivals prioritise signing a new striker this summer. While offers from the duo would be hard to turn down, David has been sent a warning ahead of his decision.",
      "The striker is a key player for Canada, having already become their record goalscorer. But boss Jesse Marsch has warned him he will need regular game-time next season if he wants to be part of Canada's sqiad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "“Knowing Johnny, he is going to want to play,” Marsch said. “He’s going to want to go to the best club he can be at. And I think achieve the most in terms of what it would mean to compete for trophies in Europe. But he’s going to want to play as well.",
      "\"And I think that’s important. I think the most important thing for him is, it’s not good if he goes somewhere and then he has to play on the bench a lot and not get minutes to keep himself sharp and fit and ready to go, especially with the World Cup being a year away.",
      "“I don’t even think Johnny really knows quite yet what that is, but I’m sure he’ll make a good decision. We’re hopeful that he can be with us this summer. But more importantly, we want him to be in a good situation, so that the next year that he has under his belt really leads him into the 2026 World Cup in a good way.”",

      "Though it has not yet been announced, the right-back is widely expected to join Real Madrid. Despite that, an starting line-up of top stars can still be created, giving fans and team chiefs food for thought.",
      "A number of goalkeepers are among the 66 free agents, though only one really inspires much confidence as the potential to be a regular number one. That is Lukasz Fabianski, who will leave West Ham.",
      "The former Arsenal man made more than 200 appearances for the Hammers and while he is now 40, could still do a job for a team battling relegation. At right-back, highly-rated Tariq Lampety is on course to leave Brighton.",
      "He joined the Seagulls from Chelsea and could be a cheap option for a top team looking to boost their options. In a similar vein to Fabianski, Ben Mee certainly still has the ability to be a rock at the back for a Premier League team.",
      "Mee is leaving Brentford this summer but remains an impressive performer for the Bees. Alongside him in our line-up is Ben Davies, who is on course to leave Tottenham, despite being in with a shout of starting the Europa League final.",
      "At left-back is Davies' current team-mate Sergio Reguilon, who had a loan spell at Manchester United last year. Reguilon is only 28 and has played for a series of top sides, though will need to leave Spurs to kickstart his career.",

      "Fellow Gunner Jorginho could play in Partey's place, though he is on course to move to South America, with this XI focusing on players without a destination. Playing further ahead of Partey is Christian Eriksen, who is leaving Manchester United.",
      "Eriksen has not played his best football at Old Trafford, though his spell at Brentford means he could still attract attention from midtable Premier League sides. Completing our midfield trio is Kevin De Bruyne, who is departing Manchester City, much to his frustration.",
      "De Bruyne has been linked with a move to the MLS, though a team who has earned European qualification may well be able to convince him to remain in England. Moving into the attack, Pablo Sarabia would line up on the right wing.",
      "The Spain international is set to leave Wolves, having been largely restricted to substitute appearances this season. On the left in our line-up is Willian, who is departing Fulham after his second spell with the Cottagers.",
      "The Brazilian previously flopped at Arsenal but has been a solid player for Marco Silva. Completing our line-up is Callum Wilson, who despite his injuries at Newcastle, has proven to be a rare reliable goalscorer in the top-flight."

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Manchester United in Bilbao ahead of Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "United fans have started to arrive in the Basque country ahead of tomorrow's match as both sides look to put their league disappointment to one side this season as they go in search of winning a European trophy.",
      "A place in next season's Champions League is up for grabs but it appears both sides are taking different approaches.",
      "Spurs made the trip to Bilbao on Monday evening and will train in Spain today. Meanwhile, United will train in Carrington this morning before making the flight over this afternoon.",
      "Stick with us right here for all of the best coverage of United fans in Bilbao, both club's open training sessions and both Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou and United boss Ruben Amorim facing the media in their respective press conferences, throughout the day.",
      "You would never guess United are about to play a European final. That was a very light-hearted press conference. Ruben Amorim struggled to stifle his laughter when Harry Maguire was asked whether goalscoring and dribbling was part of a new tactical system and Bruno Fernandes butting in to say Amorim was under pressure got a real laugh in the room.",
      "\"He's after my job,\" said Amorim. \"He will make a very good coach.\"",
      "That's all from Ruben Amorim, Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire. They were each in very good spirits and seemed very relaxed with just over 24 hours to go until kick-off.",
      "\"I just think the best starting XI to start the game. It is then really important to have options on the bench to change the game. Sometimes it is really important to win a final. I am not thinking about going to extra-time. Of course, we have that possibility, but we never think about that. In the beginning of the game, I just want to win the game really fast. But as we proved against Lyon, if we have to score three goals in six minutes, we are able to do it.\"",
      "\"I don't know. In this kind of club, also Tottenham, it is strange that you have some coaches who lose games and get sacked. I think people see that sometimes I am thinking more about the club than myself. We have a lot of issues that in the context is really hard. I don't know how to explain how the fans like me in this moment. I try to prove myself to the fans, to the board.\"",
      "\"I think it is hard to speak about that in this moment because you need to be excited and confident. We know that we need to change a lot of things in our club. The recruitment, the academy, we need to improve. That will not be solved by winning a cup. We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow, that winning of feeling will give us every strength to do every job that we have to do.\"",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, up and down the wing! Listen, I found myself on the wing against Bilbao and I managed to put a cross in. I have gone up front in latter minutes of games. Tomorrow night, I hope not to be going up front and chasing a league. I am more than happy playing in my favourite position.\"",
      "\"Every game that you have a chance to win a trophy is very big. Apart from that, every game at this club is massive. This club is so big that one week you can be the hero, the next week you can be the villain. We just want to get our hands on a trophy. It won't change the past, but what it can affect is the future. Winning a competition gives you a lot of things; in this case you get a place in the Champions League and revenue in the club.\"",
      "\"It is amazing to be back in the team and playing regularly. This season, I have played a lot football. I don't take too much notice of the plaudits from the media. I try and stay as level as I can and go into every game trying to do my best, and that is all you can do.\"",
      "\"Of course it's a frustration. When you play for this club, you want to win every football match, and this season we have been far too inconsistent. We have not been good enough in the Premier League. It has been different in the Europa League. We have proven this season we can beat anyone. We can improve next season. But we have an important game tomorrow night. We have prepared well and we are looking forward to it.\"",
      "\"Our system is a normal system that can change the characteristics. It is a system like any other. It doesn't matter what happened in the last final because it was a different team, a different competition and a different context. I just focus on Tottenham and the way that they play.\"",
      "\"It is very important. The manager has been very clear with that. We want to be at the top of everything. Everything we are involved in. We know it is not always possible to be in finals and win trophies. But our aim is to be at the end of comeptitions and fighting to win trophies. We have a big game, a big final, and a big opportunity.\"",
      "\"The advantage, I don't know. You have to see the context. I don't know the context of Tottenham. We rested some players after Bilbao because we were afraid of some injuries. Five days before the final, I thought the best thing to prepare the final was to give the players the chance to play. It was really clear that we need to compete. I felt that against Chelsea. When we are focused and play our game, we can control any game in any place.\"",
      "\"We talk about the Europa League. The Europa League is everything on our mind and we can be successful in this competition. Our aim is to get to the end of each competition and win trophies. I am not here thinking I can be one of the captains to win a European trophy. The main thing is that we can bring to the trophy back to Manchester.\"",
      "\"Again, I don't think that is the case. We are doing things that we need to do. Our club can have revenues without Champions League. It is a big brand. I am always playing for more than myself. I am coaching for my players, my staff and especially our fans.\"",
      "\"A new future for me, I think, is not the case. People will look at our team in a different way, as winning a European title is really important. Nothing is going to change our season, but winning a European title can help us have that feeling to build a future.\"",
      "\"Me neither [didn't expect Joshua Zirkzee to be fit]! They recovered quite well. They pushed. Of course, we respect the feeling of the player but we pushed a little bit. They can help us win the game. De Ligt is out.\"",

      "Of course, we don't know yet if the aforementioned trio will be fit enough to start, but if they are, Amorim has some tough calls to make.",
      "Yoro was in great form prior to his injury and would strengthen United's back-three if deemed fit enough to start the game. Meanwhile, Dalot was virtually an ever-present prior to his recent injury and could be an option at right wing-back.",

The piece he took umbrage with was not merely a mischievous piece of sub-editing, either. The word 'clown' appeared in the copy, which was bold of the reporter (who was one of the first to ask Postecoglou a question).",
      "Sources say Postecoglou has expected this to be his last season at Tottenham for a couple of months, so he can afford to let off some steam every now and then. He was not as cantankerous as some of the quotes suggest in black and white.",
      "Postecoglou provided some relaxed answers and it was a press conference tinge with poignancy as he reflected on his Greek roots and late father. Wherever he goes, the press corps will be onto a winner.",
      "That concludes Ange Postecoglou's pre-match press conference. He got a little bit spiky with his responses to a couple of questions.",
      "Ruben Amorim, Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire will be along later on for United to preview tomorrow night's game.",
      "\"I won't be the first person who has changed jobs, mate; we all change jobs. My future is assured. I have got a beautiful family, a great life. I will keep on winning trophies until I finish. Don't worry about my future.\"",
      "\"Again, I think that would be not really helpful. I have said to the lads from day one that nothing is guaranteed in life and in sport. You have just got to try and take every opportunity before you. I have been in this position before, where a big game is the last game I managed. Nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club. Tomorrow, my mind is only on one thing and that is trying to create something special.\"",
      "\"It is massive to get Sonny back. We were a little bit worried when he picked up the injury as we weren't sure how long he would be out for. He worked so hard to get back. You can see his sharpness is coming back. He is so important to the group. He is such an important figure at this football club. I want to give him a trophy that his career deserves. Not many players have come from Asia and stayed in the Premier League for so long. It would be great to cap it off with a trophy for him.\"",
      "\"Richy, I am so pleased for him because he has had a tough time since he has been at Tottenham. He has never really had a stretch of games. It has been very tough on him physically and emotionally. He plays with so much passion and determination. He has quality as well. It is great to have him in the team. He provides something different to our other attacking players.\""

      "Speaking to Suffolk News, former United man Luke Chadwick has claimed he has faith that Delap will be a success at Old Trafford if he returns to the north west in this transfer window.",
      "He's a bit of a throwback, isn't he? You saw him growing up at Man City and physically, he was always above the other players within his age group and you wondered, would he take that into professional football? He went out on a couple of loans where he wasn't fantastic and then went to Ipswich, where he's been great. You only have to look at the amount of goals he's scored in the Premier League. He seems to, particularly a few months in, have grown in arrogance – in a good way. You see him at Old Trafford (in February) and he's shoving them all over the place and he's getting stuck into it. It feels like he's at a time now where he can go and play at a top club. Unfortunately, Man United isn’t the top club at the moment, but I think bringing someone like that in would be brilliant for Man United. I think it would be a brilliant move for Delap as well.",
      "Following the expected arrival of Cunha in the summer transfer window, you feel the Reds will then shift their focus to a centre-forward.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is their top target for that position.",
      "His relatively small price tag of £30m is seen as tempting by the Reds while his age and goal return this season (22 and 12 respectively) are believed to be playing in his favour.",
      "However there was a factor which was bothering him.",
      "He looks like he’s got the attributes that Ruben Amorim wants. He knows that physically, his team are just not strong or quick enough, so Matheus Cunha is obviously athletic, and he’s got quality with 15 league goals this season. I just worry for any signing coming to Manchester United at the minute. It just feels like it’s such a bad place to go. The quality of play right now is so poor. And with Cunha, is he a centre-forward or is he a wide player? There’s no doubt that he has quality and of course, it would be nice to sign him, but I worry about where he fits in. You can sign the best three players in the world, and I think they’ll struggle coming into this team at the minute, but they’ve got to start somewhere."

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has suggested playing Bruno Fernandes in a couple of unfamiliar positions against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday night.",
      "The Reds have travelled to Bilbao on Tuesday ahead of the big clash with Spurs. Both teams know that the winner of the final will book their place in next season's Champions League while the loser faces the reality of no European football in 2025/26.",
      "United's key player will undoubtedly be Fernandes. The captain has managed 19 goals and 19 assists this season and has adapted well to the No.10 position in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "\"The best way might be to drop Fernandes back in the central midfield role alongside Casemiro, which has worked well in the past, especially in European games. I think Amorim will start [Rasmus] Hojlund in the final because he hasn’t been too bad in the Europa League.",
      "\"He’s looked like a real threat and scored some important goals, but in the Premier League, he’s been really poor. If Amorim wanted to change things up, he could play Bruno Fernandes as a false nine just like Erik ten Hag did in last season’s FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "\"I know he’s tried Kobbie Mainoo in that position too, but I don’t think he’s suited to it and Fernandes is a bit more mobile. With Fernandes playing as a false centre-forward, you could also start with Casemiro and [Manuel] Ugarte in central midfield.",
      "\"There are plenty of selection dilemmas for Amorim, but I just hope he gets it right. The problem is the manager doesn’t know what he’s going to get from most of his players on the day.\""

      "Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou has confirmed midfielder Pape Matar Sarr will be available for Wednesday night's Europa League final against Manchester United - but Lucas Bergvall will miss out.",
      "The midfielder was forced off in the second half of Spurs' 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Friday night, sparking fears he could be in danger of missing the showpiece event at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao.",
      "Sarr, 22, went straight down the tunnel at Villa Park, flanked by a member of Spurs' medical team, but Postecoglou later confirmed that he did not anticipate it was \"anything too serious\".",
      "\"Pape felt something in his back, so we took him off as a bit of a precaution,\" Postecoglou said after the game. \"I don’t think it's anything too significant, speaking to him afterwards but he just felt something in his back.\"",
      "The Spurs boss has now insisted that the Senegalese international is available to be involved against United, telling the media at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday afternoon: \"Pape is fine.\"",
      "However, the Spurs chief will have to make do without midfielder Bergvall. Despite being ruled out for the rest of the season a few weeks ago due to an ankle injury, rumours had been circling to suggest the midfielder could make a surprise return against the Reds.",
      "However, the Londoners' injury situation has not changed, meaning the Swede will play no part against Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "\"Team news is the same as last week,\" said Postecoglou. \"Lucas will not be available.\"",
      "Spurs flew out to the Basque Country on Monday and James Maddison was within their travelling squad. He, like Bergvall, was ruled out for the remainder of the season a few weeks ago.",
      "However, confirmation from Postecoglou that the injury situation remains unchanged means the attacking-midfielder is poised to miss the final."

      "David Beckham appears to have criticised Manchester United's decision to sell Scott McTominay.",
      "The 50-year-old, who like McTominay, rose through the ranks of United's academy, said he \"hates\" seeing high-quality young players being sold \"purely for financial reasons\". McTominay, who is now flourishing at Napoli, made over 250 appearances for the Red Devils before being sold for a mere £25.7million last summer, with then-manager Erik ten Hag justifying the sale as necessary to balance the club's books.",
      "Since moving to Italy, the Scotland international has been in outstanding form, playing a pivotal role in Napoli's pursuit of the Serie A title. With 18 goal contributions in all competitions, he's earned the nickname \"the bottle opener\" due to his ability to score vital, breakthrough goals.",
      "Meanwhile, United have had a disastrous season. With 18 Premier League defeats and only two spots separating them from the relegation zone, the club are facing their worst domestic finish in decades.",
      "In an interview with The Athletic, Beckham emphasised the importance of developing and keeping academy graduates who understand the club. Although he didn't mention McTominay directly, the timing and context of his comments strongly imply that the midfielder was at the front of his mind.",
      "\"I hate [the idea of] any young player who has grown up at United leaving the club. We shouldn't be selling players purely for financial reasons,\" the former England captain said.",
      "\"It should be what they are doing on the field and if they're not performing, there's always a chance [they'll be left out of the team or sold]. We all knew that, I knew that.",
      "\"If I wasn't performing on the pitch, it didn't matter what I'd done in the past or what I was going to do in the future; there was a good chance that I was either going to get left on the bench, or I was going to get sold.",
      "\"I'd like to think that Manchester United don't sell players that have grown up at the club, understand and love the club. I don't want to see players leave Manchester United if they care about United like I do.\"",
      "Beckham, who was a pivotal member of United's revered 'Class of 92' alongside Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, and Nicky Butt, speaks with authority on the importance of nurturing talent from within. This cohort broke into the first team under Sir Alex Ferguson, securing their place as regulars and clinching numerous Premier League titles, domestic cups, and the famed Treble in 1999.",
      "\"We were lucky to be part of the most stable club with the same manager, owner, fans and players there for many years,\" Beckham noted. \"We know when you have stability within the club, you have success. Simple as that.\"",
      "McTominay never enjoyed the same level of stability or trust at United. Over seven full seasons in the senior squad, he served under four different managers, resulting in inconsistent team selection, frequent role changes, and a constant need to prove his worth despite being one of the more reliable performers during a turbulent period.",
      "He was often viewed as dispensable rather than essential, and was never treated like a superstar. Given this context, his transfer to Napoli was a logical move.",
      "Under the guidance of Antonio Conte, McTominay has finally been assigned a defined role and given the backing to excel, becoming the midfield dynamo powering one of Europe's most thrilling teams. This weekend, Napoli have the opportunity to secure only their fourth Scudetto in their history - and just the second since the era of Diego Maradona.",
      "A victory against Cagliari on the final day would see them edge out Champions League finalists Inter Milan for the title - an extraordinary feat, particularly given the departures of both Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia over the past year.",
      "However, in McTominay, they've unearthed an unexpected gem - a midfield maestro demonstrating that greatness doesn't always come with fanfare. Sometimes, it's quietly cultivated through resilience, consistency, and a desire to be recognised - a lesson United would do well to remember."

      "After Dean Henderson remained at Sheffield United for a second season-long loan, he immediately embarked on a pre-season beep test. He came first.",
      "Henderson was not lording it, though. The Sheffield United manager, Chris Wilder, was absent from the pre pre-season and Henderson was on the blower to him immediately, imploring him to get the outfield players in ship-shape ahead of the club’s first Premier League campaign in 12 years.",
      "That sounds like Henderson, a violet that does not shrink. It was in keeping with his bolshy personality that Henderson revelled in the post-match confrontation with Pep Guardiola at Wembley on Saturday. “You got your ten minutes,” he quipped, holding out both hands in case Guardiola hadn’t heard.",
      "Joe Hart has a lot to answer for. Henderson, Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale, England’s three main goalkeepers, are all kindred spirits. They are vocal, expressive, impetuous and more cocky than confident.",
      "Henderson, unlike Pickford and Ramsdale, now has a winner’s medal. His performance in the FA Cup final was career-defining. There was brilliance with the denials of Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush but also that rashness when he carried the ball out for a corner and patted it away from outside his area. He fortuitously avoided expulsion.",
      "Henderson travelled to Wembley with United for the League Cup final against Southampton in 2017. He was involved in the warm-up but back in his Paul Smith suit for the dressing room celebrations, clutching a bottle of beer. He had a taste for success, and got his hands on the trophy, but did not get a medal.",
      "Nick Cox, the head of the Manchester United academy, was quick to congratulate Henderson at the weekend. “Well played Deano. Once a red always a red,” he posted on Twitter.",
      "The United academy is quick to pat itself on the back. Their blueprint for Henderson was immaculate: loans at National League, League Two, League One, the Championship and in the Premier League before United gave consideration to installing him as their number one.",
      "When Henderson joined Stockport County in early 2016, some of his teammates in the United academy derided him for stooping to non-league football. His adviser assured him they would not have a career in the game. Henderson was shortly recalled amid injury to David de Gea and on the bench at Shrewsbury Town in the fifth round of the FA Cup.",
      "Shortly after he joined Grimsby Town later that year, Henderson informed the Grimsby Telegraph he intended to become the best goalkeeper in the world. He was 19.",
      "That fourth-tier loan stint was compelling enough for Shrewsbury Town to recruit him on loan in 2017. Henderson saved his first penalty at Wembley in the League One Play-off final.",
      "Carelessly, United had allowed Henderson to enter the final months of his first professional contract in 2018. A bump in pay and a loan to Sheffield United safeguarded their investment. Luke Shaw’s sister, Nicole, was present for Henderson’s contract signing as part of work experience with the Stellar agency. It was the first of three new deals in successive years.",
      "Jose Mourinho liked the cut of Henderson’s jib, so much so that he felt he was the best 'keeper at United when Mourinho was manager of Tottenham. United, though, were in the midst of negotiations for a new contract for De Gea in the summer of 2018. De Gea’s feeble performances for Spain at the World Cup in Russia marked the start of a gradual decline.",
      "Even after De Gea renewed in September 2019, United had a loose succession plan: let Henderson get a top-flight season under his belt, integrate him into the squad and then promote him.",
      "United did not reckon on the indecisive Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, though. Solskjaer indicated Henderson would fly to Perth for the pre-season tour after his Under 21 European Championship commitments. The only United Henderson planned on linking up with was in Sheffield.",
      "When Henderson returned to Manchester in August 2020, he was remunerated handsomely: a £100,000-a-week contract. Chelsea offered United £40million for him at one stage.",
      "Suddenly, United had two ‘keepers on a combined weekly salary of nearly £500,000. De Gea’s form suffered amid credible competition in 2020-21 and several United players thought Henderson should have replaced him after their Champions League group stage ejection by RB Leipzig.",
      "It took a pregnancy for Henderson to gain number-one status. De Gea’s partner, Edurne Garcia, was about to give birth in March 2021 and De Gea flew back to Spain for the arrival of his daughter, Yanay. Covid-19 protocols ensured De Gea would miss at least four games. Henderson was promised a six-match run: Crystal Palace, Manchester City, AC Milan at home, West Ham, Milan away and Leicester City.",
      "He kept clean sheets in four of the games and atoned for Milan defender Simon Kjaer’s late equaliser in the first leg with a decent denial of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at San Siro.",
      "De Gea was out of quarantine and available for the Milan and Leicester ties but they were in the Europa League and FA Cup and Henderson was United’s cup goalie. After the March internationals, Henderson lined up in the home fixture against Brighton and De Gea started against Granada, clear confirmation Henderson was first choice.",
      "The man-management rotation was mismanagement. De Gea earned a start in the Europa League final yet endured the worst possible penalty-shootout, conceding all 11 kicks and then having his kick saved in sudden death.",
      "The pressure got to Henderson, too. Conscious that De Gea had a reputation for staying on his line, he charged out to the edge of the 18-yard box to punch away a cross but was beaten to it by Chris Wood. The Burnley striker scored but was flagged offside.",
      "After the season ended, Solskjaer informed Henderson he would be installed as number one. Henderson, who withdrew from England’s European Championship squad with a quad injury, attended the final, soaked up the pre-match atmosphere in Boxpark Wembley, contracted Covid and was laid low for two months. De Gea remained number one, regained form and Henderson played a meagre three games in 2021-22.",
      "Henderson visited St James’ Park at the end of that season but Newcastle United lost their nerve and Burnley’s relegation made a permanent move for Nick Pope straightforward. Henderson moved to another newly-promoted team in Nottingham Forest.",
      "United banked a derisory £15m fee, rising to £20m, from Palace in August 2023. Dougie Freedman, the club’s sporting director, was in the Old Trafford directors’ box for Henderson’s last matchday squad involvement with a club he joined at the age of 14 in 2011.",
      "By that point, Henderson was so itching to leave United permanently he was loitering around the away dressing room in the tunnel.",
      "Henderson has said he regrets a piqued interview he gave to Talksport upon his loan move to Forest. Some United fans bizarrely booed him when he returned with Palace in the League Cup last season. There was a myth that he leaked information when the finger of blame could be pointed at someone else who is long since gone."

      "After Manchester United failed to win any of their opening three matches in the Europa League this season, few would have banked on them reaching the final in Bilbao.",
      "Despite taking the lead in all of their opening three league phase outings, United amassed a paltry three points from a possible nine, drawing with FC Twente (1-1), FC Porto (3-3) and Fenerbahce (1-1).",
      "The stalemate with Fenerbahce in Istanbul left United 21st in the league phase table. It also left Erik ten Hag clinging on to his job.",
      "Alongside making an underwhelming start to their Europa League campaign, United experienced a difficult start to their Premier League season. They won just three of their opening nine matches, leaving them 14th in the table.",
      "United's ninth game of their league campaign saw them beaten 2-1 by West Ham United at the London Stadium, just three days after they were pegged back by Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.",
      "That defeat to the Hammers, which was United's fourth in their opening nine league games, marked the end of the road for Ten Hag, who was dismissed the following day, just months after Ineos decided to keep him.",
      "United, almost as soon as Ten Hag had cleared his office, were on the phone to Sporting Lisbon and attempting to convince Ruben Amorim to replace him. Despite the Portuguese chief being hesitant about moving to Old Trafford mid-season, United got their man, appointing him just four days after Ten Hag had been dismissed.",
      "As part of the agreement, Amorim stayed at Sporting until the November international break, meaning Ruud van Nistelrooy was placed in temporary charge.",
      "He won three of his four games at the helm, drawing the other, and it felt as though Amorim would pick up from where the Dutchman had left off. His short spell in charge did improve the mood in and around the club. It also saw United get their Europa League campaign up and running with a 2-0 win over PAOK at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Amorim's obsession with his trademark 3-4-2-1 system meant that teething problems were to be expected at the start of his tenure. After a solid first set of results saw United draw 1-1 at Ipswich Town, beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 and brush Everton aside 4-0, United's supporters hoped the transition to Amorim's preferred system would be seamless.",
      "Amorim's warning about a storm being on its way soon came to fruition, though, and United started stumbling. The 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium was the only highlight in a forgettable December.",
      "However, despite the disappointment and frustrations of United's Premier League form, their results and performances in Europe have seen them reach the Europa League final. Wednesday night's clash with Tottenham Hotspur offers them the opportunity to salvage something from what has been a disastrous campaign.",
      "United head into the clash with Spurs boasting an unbeaten record in Europe this season, winning nine and drawing five of their 14 Europa League matches. They won each of the four league phase matches Amorim took charge of, ensuring they finished in an automatic qualification spot for the last-16.",
      "Despite being held to a draw in the first leg of their last-16 tie with Real Sociedad in Spain, they came from behind to make light work of them at Old Trafford in the second leg, winning 4-1 to seal a 5-2 aggregate triumph.",
      "Lyon were up next in the quarter-finals and United, as we all know, made hard work of that one. After the first leg finished 2-2 in France, United were heading for the exit in the second leg at Old Trafford, trailing 4-2 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate with just minutes to go.",
      "However, goals from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire meant the Europa League dream remained alive. Maguire's dramatic header was perhaps a sign that it is simply meant to be for United in this competition.",
      "Athletic Bilbao, despite looking as though they would pose the sternest test United had faced in Europe all season, were blown away in the semi-finals. United won 3-0 in Spain and 4-1 at Old Trafford to progress to the final with a commanding 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Now, of course, they are one step away from winning a European trophy and securing a place back in Europe's premier club competition next season.",
      "Despite how poor their domestic form has been this season, supporters of other clubs in this country would kill to be in the position United will find themselves in on Wednesday evening.",
      "After the way in which this Europa League campaign started and a managerial alteration needing to be made just months into the season, United deserve credit for reaching a European final. Now they need to win it."

      "A major European final probably isn't the time to start tinkering with your preferred starting XI, but Ruben Amorim might be about to make a selection call nobody saw coming.",
      "A couple of weeks ago it felt as though Manchester United's starting XI for the Europa League final was nailed on, with Kobbie Mainoo perhaps the only player who could complicate matters if he could prove to Amorim he was worthy of a place in his best team.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has played in every United game so far this season bar the Manchester derby in December, where he and Marcus Rashford were dropped.",
      "The youngster's reaction to being left out of the victorious derby day squad must be commended, and he's gone on to become a key member of Amorim's squad in the months following that omission, despite being asked to play in a No.10 position with very different demands to his natural role as a winger.",
      "However, his role as a substitute in the two games United have played since confirming their place in the final of the Europa League has felt telling.",
      "Amorim has been keen to offer some of his players a rest between the second leg victory over Athletic Bilbao and the final against Spurs on Wednesday. But the United head coach has maintained he wants his side to build momentum and so all of his available key men have started at least one of the defeats to West Ham and Chelsea. Suddenly Garnacho's place in Wednesday's starting team doesn't look quite so assured.",
      "Mason Mount enjoyed his finest night in a United shirt when his brilliant cameo saw him bag a brace to ease any fears that United could throw away their lead against Athletic at Old Trafford. The former Chelsea man has gone on to start both of the following games, playing an hour against West Ham and a further 70 minutes at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Amorim has made no secret of his \"love\" for Mount and it feels as though he might be getting back up to speed in time to pencil his name in the manager's starting XI plans.",
      "A few months ago you'd have had Garnacho down a certain starter in United's biggest game in years. Amorim might be about to spring a surprise."

      "The simple answer is no. UEFA rules state: \"Yellow cards expire on completion of the quarter-finals. They are not carried forward to the semi-finals.\" That means it is impossible to be suspended for the final due to the accumulation of yellow cards, with three needed to result in a suspension and only two legs played in the semi-final.",

      "There were links to a move to Old Trafford in January, but the Red Devils were unable to afford the Swedish international, having made wing-back Patrick Dorgu their priority at the time.",
      "Amorim’s side face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday, with a place in next season’s Champions League and around £100million on the line.",
      "That income would help United rebuild their squad to suit Amorim’s style of play, with defeat expected to hit them hard and possibly result in the exit of one or two young stars such as Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "F365 SAYS: Gyokeres too old, too big, too striker-ish for Arsenal? The nonsense debunked",
      "United downed tools in the Premier League some time ago and currently sit 16th, so their season will essentially end on Wednesday night in Bilbao, with summer transfer business immediately taking centre stage.",
      "According to French outlet L’Equipe, the Manchester giants have ‘a clear idea of the avenues to explore for each targeted position’ in the summer window and ‘have already completed the signing of’ Matheus Cunha. Reports suggest the Wolves forward will cost United £67million.",
      "Another attacker is expected to join Amorim’s ranks and ‘the trail leading to Viktor Gyokeres remains very active’.",

      "French champions Paris Saint-Germain have previously been linked with Gyokeres, but the report says they ‘no longer seem to be in the race’. Luis Enrique apparently does not want to sign a new striker, ‘and even less so an expensive player’, it’s said.",

      "“Essentially if something comes up they will assess it, but the focus is on Gyokeres at the moment, Andrea Berta feels like he is the one — Arsenal aren’t going out there and saying it but it does feel like that.”",
      "Bailey adds that RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is also someone Arsenal ‘have done a lot of work on’, though there is also interest from London rivals Chelsea.",
      "Meanwhile, Liam Delap has been tipped to join Manchester United from Ipswich Town.",

      "The latest inspection, carried out by environmental health officers in mid-April, revealed evidence of mice in ‘seven areas across the stadium’, including high-end suites such as the Ambassador Lounge, the Manchester Suite, and the Number 7 Suite, as per the Daily Mail, who ‘has seen the inspection report from environmental health experts’.",
      "In some instances, droppings were discovered ‘under the buffet bar’, raising serious concerns about hygiene in spaces that serve food to thousands of supporters.",
      "The Number 7 Suite, described by the club as ‘one of the most stylish spaces’ in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, starts at £550 per person. The Manchester Suite, where a ‘large number of droppings’ were reportedly found, typically costs around £600 per head.",
      "This marks the continuation of a worrying trend, after United’s rating dropped from four to two stars back in November, prompting a series of internal measures to improve cleanliness and pest control.",
      "In response to the latest findings, a Manchester United spokesperson said the club ‘implements a robust pest-control system’ and carries out ‘multiple weekly checks’ across all catering zones.",
      "They added: ‘Stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served,’ and that ‘immediate and appropriate action’ is taken if any incidents occur.",

      "The stadium houses 29 kitchens and catering facilities, meaning problems in any area can affect the overall rating.",
      "Inspectors also highlighted other hygiene concerns, including ‘dirty’ areas and improper food labelling.",
      "One cited case involved a container of pesto labelled for use over a month, despite the manufacturer stating it should be consumed within eight days. These issues are reportedly being ‘addressed immediately’.",
      "Despite the renewed two-star rating, the inspection report acknowledged that ‘significant work has taken place to control the mice activity’, but urged United to ‘persevere with the measures being implemented to eradicate activity within food areas.’",

      "Man Utd have asked Barcelona for a specific player in exchange for Marcus Rashford in order to complete a transfer this summer, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed Rashford to leave on loan to Aston Villa at the end of the January transfer window after his relationship with Ruben Amorim broke down.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim played Rashford for the last time on December 12 against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League being leaving him out of every match until his eventual departure.",
      "Since joining Aston Villa in the winter transfer window, Rashford has been in brilliant form and has no doubt convinced the Villans to sign him in the summer if they can justify the outlay.",
      "But Unai Emery admitted, after Rashford produced a brilliant performance in a recent Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain, that it will be “difficult” for Aston Villa to sign him permanently.",
      "Emery said at the end of April: “It (signing him in the summer) is difficult to plan now. He’s feeling comfortable and better. He played a fantastic match.’",
      "READ: Big Midweek: Europa League final, Heung-min Son, FA Cup winners Crystal Palace, Pep Guardiola",
      "“If he’s happy, we are happy. Then, of course, it depends on the circumstances and what happens in the next weeks, and (what we have) in the next year as well.”",
      "At the end of April it was revealed that it was now ‘highly likely’ that Rashford would miss the rest of the season at Aston Villa and the summer transfer speculation started in earnest.",
      "Barcelona have been linked multiple times recently with Rashford ‘given the green light’ to pursue a move to Barcelona this summer as Man Utd are keen to offload the England international.",
      "And now reports in Spain claim that Man Utd have ‘asked’ for Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo in exchange for Rashford with the Red Devils previously ‘willing to put an offer of more than €60 million on the table’ for a straight transfer.",
      "The Catalan giants ‘could close a swap deal’ with Man Utd with Rashford ‘back on Barca’s radar’ after proving that ‘he’s still a top-level star’.",
      "It is understood that ‘the option that has gained traction is to finalise a swap deal in which Ronald Araujo would be the other player, although he is not in the plans.’",
      "Whether in a swap deal for Rashford or not, the Uruguay international’s ‘departure is all but confirmed when the transfer window opens’.",
      "The report adds that Premier League giants Man Utd ‘still appears to be interested in taking him on, as they did in the past, when they even submitted a formal offer.’",
      "Earlier this month, Barcelona sporting director Deco admitted that the Catalan giants were missing strength in the wide areas of their side, something which Rashford could provide.",
      "Deco said: “If we can improve, that’s always an option, but the key is to consolidate what we have for the coming years.",
      "“Suddenly we feel quite dependent on Raphinha and Lamine. Maybe we need similar players, a solution for them [when they’re not available],” the Portuguese confessed.",

      "Eddie Howe is in the market for another striker, with Callum Wilson expected to leave and the demands of European football next season placing added pressure on leading scorer Alexander Isak.",
      "Delap’s strong campaign at a struggling Ipswich side has caught the eye, with 12 goals in 35 Premier League appearances enough to convince several top-flight clubs that he is ready for a step up.",

      "Delap is believed to prefer staying in the north west, having joined Man City as a teenager and spent the last few years based in the region.",
      "But speaking on talkSPORT, former England striker Darren Bent summed up one potential concern at Old Trafford. “Double Hojlund, yeah?” he said, referencing the potential similarities between the youngster Delap and the Danish forward who has struggled at times to lead the line alone.",
      "United fan Andy Goldstein was even more direct. “I think he’s a really good player, I don’t think he’s the finished article just yet,” he said. “And we’ve got a Liam Delap [in Hojlund], and it’s not working at the minute. We’ve got a Liam Delap. I think two of them is not the answer.”",
      "The comments echoed Jamie Carragher’s warning earlier this week, when he suggested Delap would be better served taking an intermediate step, such as Everton, before joining a top-six club.",
      "Jamie Carragher has warned a Premier League striker to steer clear of a move to Man Utd, naming Everton as a more suitable destination.",
      "Liam Delap would rather join Man United than Chelsea, or he would rather join Chelsea than Man United. It all depends whether you believe The Sun or… The Sun.",
      "Liam Delap to Manchester United is “very close” despite interest from Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United, according to reports.",

      "This historically sorry bunch of Premier League managers fared better throughout their careers than the Portuguese, who will slump beneath Ian Holloway, Micky Adams, Nigel Adkins, Steve Kean, Alex Neil and Egil Olsen in terms of points per game if Manchester United lose to Aston Villa on the final day.",

      "Dean Smith – 1.03 (126 points from 122 games with Aston Villa, Norwich and Leicester)\nThe reputation established and goodwill generated through his role as the layer of foundations upon which Aston Villa continue to build was wasted on two panicking mid-season appointments Smith might since regret.",

      "Ian Branfoot – 1.03 (68 points from 66 games with Southampton)\nNo club has had more permanent first-team managers in the Premier League era than Southampton but you always remember your first.

      "The Irishman’s 100th and final game in charge was a 4-1 defeat to Bolton at the Stadium of Light, a result met with boos and which dropped Sunderland into the bottom three.

      "Dave Bassett – 0.95 (124 points from 130 games with Sheffield United, Nottingham Forest and Leicester)\nBassett was involved in all sorts of Premier League relegations, indeed still the most of any manager ever. Four seasons in the competition resulted in a hat-trick of 20th-placed finishes with different teams: Sheffield United in 1993/94, Nottingham Forest in 1998/99 and Leicester in 2001/02. But he did start with a Brian Deane-inspired win over Manchester United in August 1992.",

      "Paul Jewell – 0.94 (130 points from 138 games with Bradford, Wigan and Derby)\nPerhaps unfairly tarnished by The Apocalypse Season at Derby, it is slightly strange that Jewell never could find top-flight roles again based on his successful fight against relegation with Bradford, seven years after which he took Wigan to a mid-table finish and League Cup final. But then he did pick up just five points in 24 games with those doomed Rams.",

      "Man Utd have received a major boost ahead of the Europa League final after Joshua Zirkzee was among three returning stars pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "The striker was initially ruled out for the remainder of the season with a hamstring injury suffered during last month’s 4-1 defeat to Newcastle. Ruben Amorim had confirmed at the time that Zirkzee would not feature again this term, telling reporters: “He will not play again this season. Let’s prepare him for the next one.”",
      "However, Zirkzee was involved in full team training at Carrington on Tuesday morning, on the day the squad flies to Spain for Wednesday’s final against Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "It marks a surprise turnaround for the Dutch forward, who had looked visibly upset when he left the pitch at St James’ Park and was widely expected to focus on recovering ahead of pre-season.",
      "His return provides a timely lift for Man Utd, who have been forced to protect Rasmus Hojlund, the only striker available for the final, in recent weeks.",
      "Zirkzee’s availability offers a new option in the final third and could influence the manager’s tactical approach against a Spurs side Utd have failed to beat in three meetings this season.",
      "Zirkzee has scored six goals and provided four assists in all competitions since arriving last summer, and his blend of physicality and link-up play has been missed in recent weeks.",
      "Amorim’s side has managed just five goals in their last eight domestic matches, with Bruno Fernandes still tasked with carrying the bulk of the attacking threat.",
      "There was further good news for Utd in their final training session before the flight to Bilbao. Both Diogo Dalot and Leny Yoro took part after recent fitness concerns, while Jonny Evans was also involved in the main portion of training.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt was absent, casting doubt over his chances of making the matchday squad. With Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw starting in the recent 1-0 defeat to Chelsea, Yoro’s return may see him replace Shaw if deemed fit enough to start.",
      "Dalot’s return also gives Amorim the option to push Noussair Mazraoui into the back three, with the Portuguese defender and Patrick Dorgu providing the width in more advanced wing-back roles.",
      "Despite sitting 16th in the Premier League and enduring a dismal domestic season, United are one win away from lifting silverware and qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Victory in Bilbao would also complete an unbeaten Europa League campaign, a feat achieved by only three other clubs in the competition’s modern era.",
      "Zirkzee’s return will now be assessed by the coaching staff, with a decision to be made on whether he features from the start or is held in reserve. Either way, his presence provides a significant boost on the eve of Utd’s biggest match of the season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",
      "One Man Utd player is getting frustrated that INEOS and Ruben Amorim are not playing him in order to get him to leave the club, according to reports.",

      "Tottenham haven’t won a major trophy in 17 years. They’ve lost five of their last six finals and stumbled into this one off the back of 21 Premier League defeats and a stack of injuries. Ange Postecoglou’s second-season promise might yet come true, but the end of his first has been nothing short of chaotic.",
      "Still, Spurs came through AZ Alkmaar, Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt in the knockouts and have beaten United three times already this season, including a 4-3 thriller in the League Cup and a 3-0 win at Old Trafford. Dominic Solanke has led the charge, with five goals and four assists in Europe.",
      "United’s league form has been no better, but in Europe, they’ve been ruthless. Ruben Amorim’s team are unbeaten in 14 matches, scoring 35 goals and eliminating the likes of Lyon and Athletic Bilbao. Fernandes leads the way with seven goals and four assists.",

      "Backing Tottenham to lift the trophy (evens with Betway) gives you the extra time safety net, while a correct score of 1-1 in 90 minutes (13/2) makes a lot of sense.",
      "For goalscorers, Dominic Solanke has netted in each of his last four Spurs starts and is 13/2 to open the scoring. If you’re siding with Utd, Bruno Fernandes to score or assist (11/10) is as solid a pick as you’ll find in that market.",
      "Discipline could also be a factor. Over 5.5 cards have landed in four of the last six all-English UEFA clashes, and with Zwayer in charge — averaging 5+ per game in Europe — this could turn feisty.",

      "Matheus Cunha “loves Man Utd”. That’s the quote fed to the media, presumably by his agent. So we fully expect Matheus Cunha to join Manchester United this summer, which would be something of a coup. And would inevitably befuddle the minds of the easily confused.",
      "Others will say he has ‘only joined Manchester United for the money’ and post images of falling wads of cash on social media, ignoring any and all evidence that United are offering no greater wage than any other Big Six club.",
      "But check Cunha’s age – he’s 25 – and clock that he turned 10 the summer after United had won their third consecutive Premier League title, reached the Champions League final and had a fella called Cristiano Ronaldo on their team. Of course he “loves Man Utd”.",
      "When Manchester United wheeled out Sir Alex Ferguson and Bryan Robson (who had last played for United a decade before he was born) in 2020, the “this is Manchester United Football Club we are talking about” charm offensive fell flat on Jude Bellingham, who turned 10 just as David Moyes was replacing Ferguson and the Banter Era was kicking off.",
      "But Cunha? He will absolutely believe United are one of the biggest clubs in the world – not measured by market share or ‘reach’, but because he has grown up watching one of the actual best football teams in the world. As a child in north-eastern Brazil, he would have dreamed of one day playing at Old Trafford and wearing red; as a 25-year-old in the Midlands, he will still hold the glowing remnants of that dream. It’s human nature.",
      "Manchester United do still have that lure. But perhaps only to players like Cunha, who are old enough to have grown up thinking that they are the pinnacle of success. How long does that sheen last? The red wasn’t shiny enough for Bellingham, who wisely chose Borussia Dortmund as the likeliest route to Real Madrid. Surely Cunha belongs to the very last generation of players who look at Old Trafford and see the Theatre of Dreams and not a crumbling circus.",
      "Modern Premier League clubs/businesses tend to focus almost exclusively on young talent with both potential and sell-on value but United’s short-term quest to re-join the elite based on something other than heritage might well lie with those players who still see them as something extraordinary.",
      "For now, Cunha is as close to a no-brainer – he fits the system, he has creativity and personality in abundance – as a signing for Manchester United this summer, but United are far from a no-brainer for a footballer who can have his pick of top-half clubs.",
      "Now it’s his job – along with his likely new teammates – to make Manchester United more than a museum tour.",
      "",
      "Carragher believes Cunha is the “perfect” fit for Amorim’s Man Utd but reckons his arrival could push one Red Devils star out. “It’s certainly not good news”.",

      "The big stuff has already been settled this season. We’ve known for months now – long before mathematical confirmation belatedly rolled in as it so often does – who was winning the league and who was being sent packing back to the Championship.",
      "But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing left to sort out in these closing days of the 2025/26 season. Here are literally 10 things of varying levels of importance that are still to be decided.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Champions League qualifiers\nSure, Liverpool have got the league wrapped up. And yes, Arsenal are going to be in the Champions League having successfully now (barring mathematical absurdities) avoided the ‘third in a two-horse race’ whimsy.",
      "But the rest? Up in the air.",
      "We do know the top five will all qualify for the Champions League this year, but which three of Newcastle, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Man City and Nottingham Forest make it alongside Liverpool and Arsenal remains very much TBC.",
      "And if Man City don’t beat Bournemouth tonight then we have the very delicious prospect of the five teams scrapping over third to seventh going into the final day separated by a single point.",
      "It’s a better climax to the season than we thought we were getting a few weeks ago, anyway.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Europa League qualifiers\nAnd if we don’t know who all the Champions League qualifiers are, then we obviously can’t know the Europa League qualifiers either, can we? One of those who misses out on the Big Cup are joining FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the Europa League, which is so easy to win even Spurs or Man United can do it.",
      "Crystal Palace London-bussing their way to a second trophy so soon after their first is a fun prospect, and there’s a very plausible chance that they too could do so in a London-Manchester final to match this year’s, against the team they’ve just beaten at Wembley. Wouldn’t that be fun?",
      "",
      "Next year’s Conference League qualifier\nOr even if there’s going to be one at all. It’s possible England won’t even have a team in next year’s Conference. We don’t pretend to understand the science of it but if Chelsea finish sixth and Newcastle don’t finish seventh and then Chelsea win the Conference League then we end up with six English teams in the Champions League and three in the Europa League! And none at all in the Conference! Because reasons!",
      "",
      "Golden Glove: Raya v Sels\nAlexander Isak’s untimely injury has denied us the chance to pretend the Golden Boot is still up for grabs this season, with a malfunctioning Erling Haaland needing seven goals in two games to pull level with long-time clear leader Mo Salah atop the charts. It’s not happening, is it?",
      "But Isak’s absence against Arsenal may well have helped gives us a neck-and-neck Golden Glove fight, because David Raya’s hard-won clean sheet against Newcastle – one that required him to make five saves in the first 20 minutes as Newcastle started much the brighter – allowed him to pull level on 13 clean sheets with Matz Sels.",
      "Sels looked like moving to 14 for most of Sunday afternoon’s game at the London Stadium, but while Jarrod Bowen’s late goal proved to be nothing more than consolation nerve-jangler for the result, it has left this fight going down to the wire neck and neck.",
      "And if you were a betting man you’d have to now favour Raya, with Arsenal up against Southampton on the final day and Sels facing the altogether trickier task of keeping out Chelsea.",
      "",
      "The match that will determine once and for all which club is the greatest on earth: Tottenham or Manchester United\nWe know England will have six teams in next season’s Champions League. We know who two of them are. We know the other three will be some flavour of competent. And then there’s the piss-boiling sixth, which is going to be one of the two stupidest teams in the league at this time because one of them is going to win the Europa League.",
      "A lot of people are unhappy about this. Arsene Wenger is so cross about it all that he’s briefly stopped trying to destroy football entirely with his batsh*t non-solution to toenail offsides. People who have absolutely no problem with the team that finishes fifth in the Premier League being in the Champions League are foaming at the mouth at the very idea of Spurs being there, people presumably in for the shock of their lives when they find out how Spurs qualified for the Europa League in the first place.",
      "We have a strong inkling about how Wednesday night will pan out based on years of evidence that tells us two things: one, Manchester United can always pinch a trophy no matter how abject they appear to be, but more importantly two, the joke is and always must be on Spurs.",
      "‘Only Spurs’ is an overused expression in these pages but there really is no other club quite like them and it really does feel like Only Spurs could carve out a situation where this season is either a) their best season in 41 years or b) their worst season in 48 years, with there being absolutely no middle ground and the whole thing settled by one game in Bilbao.",
      "And again, recent history tells you one of those options instinctively feels far more likely. But at the same time United are simply so bad that even the apparent formality of beating Spurs in a final cannot be taken for granted.",
      "What we do know for absolute certain is that by 11pm on Wednesday night X-formerly-Twitter will be awash with cry-laughing emojis and people saying ‘Can’t believe these are in the Champions League’. The loser is going to get absolutely cooked and the winner is going to boil more p*ss than has ever been boiled before.",
      "Honestly, we can’t wait.",
      "",
      "Can Antony win two European titles in one season?\nThe Europa League final is the most obvious example of how no matter what happens everyone wins yet also somehow everyone loses, but let’s not forget the humble Europa Conference League final because that is not without its charms.",
      "If Chelsea have been kind enough to finish seventh in the Premier League, then them winning it as everyone has just assumed all season long is what will happen means that England will have 10 teams in Europe next season and that’s just plain nutty.",
      "But if Real Betis win it on the back of a Man United win in the Europa League then Antony will have won more European trophies in one season than Arsenal have in their entire existence, and you have to say that’s magnificent.",
      "",
      "The race for eighth\nThis is the kind of thing we should all be able to get behind: a final-day barney for one place that probably won’t matter. And even if Chelsea do the necessary on the final day to make eighth potentially matter, it won’t be until three days later and the Conference final that we actually know for sure.",
      "This is Barclays heritage. Brighton are in pole position now after beating unapologetically beach-based flip-flop-sporting cigar-puffing Liverpool on Monday night, knowing that a final-day victory at Tottenham – who are either going to be too happy or too sad to care, surely – will be enough even if Bournemouth win both their remaining games.",
      "Brentford are still in the mix as well, but that Brighton win over Liverpool has taken Fulham out of the equation.",
      "",
      "The race for 17th\nWest Ham, bless them, have managed to stay involved in this dignity-shedding contest despite not having the excuse of a Europa League final to possibly get them out of jail, but they face Ipswich on the final day and thus this surely will come down to a fight between the stoppable force of Manchester United and the movable object of Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Sure, it’s perhaps not the most significant contest between the two that remains to be played out this season but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t all just stop and take a moment to marvel at what we’re actually saying here. Spurs. Man United. Seventeenth place.",
      "One way or another we can’t imagine either of them getting anything out of Sunday’s final game after what will for both teams whatever happens be the season-defining emotional extreme of Wednesday night.",
      "And in any case both find themselves up against demonstrably superior teams who actually have something to play for in the league, a quaint concept Spurs and United abandoned months ago. United play Villa, still in the Champions League hunt, while Spurs host a Brighton side in pole position for the uncomfortably Chelsea-dependent but nevertheless potentially significant eighth place.",
      "If we’re being very greedy indeed, we do want whoever wins the Europa League to finish 17th because it is slightly funnier than a Champions League qualifier finishing 16th even though that is already very funny indeed.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace’s maiden half-century\nSome might argue that Crystal Palace have already achieved the biggest thing they’ll do this season having won the FA Cup and thus the first major title of their entire history. To that we say tish and fipsy because that will pale into rank insignificance if they can secure a 50th point for the first time ever in any Premier League season.",
      "They are currently on 49 points with two games to go, the second of which is now set to be a rare old occasion at Anfield in which everyone is just having a big old party as Liverpool collect their Premier League trophy and Palace revel in their new-found status as trophy winners.",
      "It’s one of the games we’re most looking forward to on the final day purely because such a vibe is so rare in your toxic, tribal, online modern football warfare. A game where everyone in the stadium will just be having a lovely old time celebrating a successful season. ‘Snice.",
      "We’re thinking double guards of honour. We’re thinking both teams cavorting about with their trophies. We’re thinking everyone celebrating a late Eberechi Eze equaliser that takes Palace to the promised land of 50 points. We want to go to there.",
      "",
      "The sacrificial play-off winner\nWe did genuinely almost forget this one, which is slightly embarrassing but also revealing of how the land now lies for teams promoted from the Championship.",
      "But in terms of formalising things we don’t yet know about this season, we do need to stop and consider that we don’t yet in fact know the full line-up for next season’s Premier League until it is confirmed which poor sods are setting themselves up for a season of Derby-bothering ritual humiliation.",
      "It’s going to be Sheffield United or Sunderland, so it’s going to be a big club that in days gone by you would absolutely think had every chance of giving survival a red-hot crack. Now you assume they’re doomed unless they decide to just break all the rules and accept a points penalty in their second season is probably worth the risk if they’ve already managed to stay up at the expense of, oh, let’s say, West Ham.",
      "More likely, though: the winner of Football’s Richest Game instead condemns themselves to a season of being patronised very nearly as much as we’ve just done here while desperately scrambling to cobble 20 points together before dropping back down to the second tier to try and do it all again."

      "This was the weekend that hands Ed top billing…\nI still don’t have my voice back from Saturday yet. I wasn’t at Wembley, I couldn’t afford it and anyway, there are some times when it’s better to be in the comfort of your own home.",
      "* It’s weird, really. The more you allow yourself to dream that it might happen, the less likely it seems that it will actually happen. So you start playing down your chances, but the more you talk up your opposition the more you wonder if maybe, just maybe, there’s a chance.",
      "* As with their previous trip to the FA Cup Final, Crystal Palace were led by a very self-confident manager. The difference is that this time, when Oliver Glasner reacted to losing 5-2 to Manchester City by telling Pep Guardiola that if he used that system again, he would get beaten, you believed him.",
      "Taking Palace to the FA Cup Final and high self-confidence are where the comparisons between Glasner and one of his predecessors, Alan Pardew, begin and end. It was nice to see that Palace had invited some former managers along to Wembley: we’re all a bit better for seeing Steve Coppell, Alan Smith and Roy Hodgson on good form, and in its own way, it was telling that there was no sign of Pardew.",
      "* The other big difference between 2016 and 2025 was Palace’s form heading into the game. In 2016, between their win in the third round and defeat in the final, they took just 11 points (two wins, five draws) from 19 games – half a season! In hindsight it’s clear to see Pardew spent the day before the game negotiating a new contract, protecting himself from a justifiable sacking, instead of focussing on the most important matter.",
      "In contrast, Glasner’s 2025 side played 16 league games between the third round and the final, taking 28 points (eight wins, four draws) in that time. Just as well they had a terrible start to the season to give everyone else a chance because 1.75 points per game over the course of an entire season would put them in the European places.",
      "* This year’s Final did not take very long to establish its pattern: Manchester City dominating possession, Crystal Palace camped on the edge of their own penalty area. City had an early chance but couldn’t take it, and then the moment of magic happened. Palace gained possession and scored what has been one of their trademark goals this season. A long ball from Chris Richards on the byline found Jean-Philippe Mateta, who held the ball up on half way and exchanged passes with a midfielder (in this case Daichi Kamada) and released Daniel Muñoz down the right, where he crossed for Eberechi Eze to fire home following a Frank Lampard-esque late run.",
      "* It’s been a comparatively tough season for City, and at times Guardiola has looked a little exposed. City’s struggles for form were attributed to Rodri’s absence, and while any team would miss a player that good and that important to their system, it wasn’t the best look for Guardiola’s standing as a tactical mastermind that he had neither an alternative to Rodri in that role, nor an alternative system to compensate for their absent star. On Saturday, they huffed and puffed but largely played in the same pattern for the entire game, and paid the price for their predictability.",
      "The hardest part to understand is why, knowing how dangerous Palace are down their right, City still insisted on moving their left-back into the midfield, giving Muñoz lots of space behind to run into. What were we saying earlier about managers coming undone by overconfidence?",
      "* One time they did try something a bit different led to the most controversial moment of the game. A long ball over the top saw Erling Haaland one on one with Dean Henderson, and the Palace keeper appeared to handle the ball outside his area. I don’t think it was a red card offence, despite the doublespeak of virtually every pundit asked about it (“Haaland hasn’t scored in five games at Wembley/of course it’s a goal scoring opportunity, it’s Haaland”), because there are two levels of mitigation. First, there is a defender racing back towards the goal who can get into position to make a block while Haaland is going round Henderson. Second, Henderson’s feet are well inside his area when he reaches across the line and handles the ball – in no way was it a cynical play but it was a breach of the rules. Had the officials decide to show Henderson a yellow card in real time and award City a free kick, I don’t think there would have been many complaints from either side.",
      "* That said, reducing Palace to 10 men would not have changed the game much, because they would have still been camped on the edge of their area. And while we’re dealing with hypotheticals, there was more than a suspicion of evening up about the penalty awarded to City. The ball was running out of play, Tyrick Mitchell appeared to get a toe on it and Bernardo Silva was clearly looking for contact, but nonetheless, a penalty was awarded and then saved.",
      "Haaland held the ball while the referee was sorting out the other players, before handing it over to Omar Marmoush to take the kick. This is something that teams do so that any mind games or abuse are absorbed by a fall guy rather than the taker, and yet, not a single Palace player went anywhere near either of the City forwards. Once again, City didn’t adapt their scripted plan to what the opposition were doing, and suffered for it. It wasn’t a particularly great penalty, but Henderson made a superb double save from it and the rebound, for the sort of moment where Palace fans dare to start believing.",
      "* The penalty itself was one of seven fouls committed all game by Glasner’s team, the same number as City conceded, but it’s a testament to the Palace team’s discipline that the only yellow card any of them collected was when Henderson was cautioned for time wasting in stoppage time. In contrast, City’s frustrations got the better of them when they picked up five yellow cards. Defending that intensely for that long is incredibly tough, but to a man they performed their job admirably, it was a masterclass in how to protect a lead.",
      "* The oldest person in the world will turn 116 years old this year. They were born four years after Crystal Palace were formed and, like us, just witnessed them winning a major trophy for the first time. All the generations of Palace fans who lived and died without seeing this, all those gone too soon. This is for them as much as it is for us. There is a deep connection between club and community, the players know how much it all means to the fans, and the fans celebrate each other. The tifo before the game, of the two boys and their father (who subsequently passed away) celebrating Darren Ambrose’s goal against Manchester United in 2009, a beautiful image summing up just how much it all means.",

As for bias, I believe that pro bias is more likely than anti which is why former players are excluded, Rooney had no issue in saying City should get a man advantage.",
      "Also bias currently exists anyway, but it’s for the on field officials as the VAR tries his hardest to vindicate the decision and will come up with some convoluted reasoning, the assistant will support this and the assistant assistant is there to get the biscuits and mutter “good process, well done guys”.",

This feels as important in terms of pressure & outcome as the 2008 CL finals, where the pressure to win was immense! In no way am I comparing the status of winning the two, but just the pressure on a team to win. A Europa win is the difference between getting a Gyokeres or Mateta, 100 million or 0 million, back in the elite or a has-been club. It’s as do or die as it can be, and honestly, I don’t see us winning it.",
      "We haven’t defeated any non relegated English team other than Fulham via a deflected Martinez goal this year. Spurs have trashed us thrice. We are unable to score, unable to defend & unable to pass the ball. In all likelihood, this will be a one sided Spurs trashing. Unless Spurs forget to show up, I cannot see any way United win this. I am hoping & praying that we somehow get our sh*t together, but every match I watch makes it more painfully obvious that we are nowhere near the elite level. But winning the Europa changes everything. it would be close to a 3 year leap we take in our growth. It’s the biggest and best shortcut we have, it’s a jackpot, an undeserved jackpot. Here is to hoping against all logic that United & Amorim can pull off a masterclass in the finals.",
      "On the other hand, I am glad the opponents are Spurs. If there is one team I don’t mind winning this trophy, it’s poor Spurs. They really need to win something in life, and this could be a good booster for them and also cement their place as the 2nd biggest London club AFTER Crystal Palace for the 24/25 season only.

It certainly won’t patch up the financial issues that have arisen from years of poor transfer and wage decisions, which led to hundreds of redundancies from arguably the last set of employees who deserve to be let go. It definitely won’t create the atmosphere of clarity you suggest it will, a new set of ideas, a new range of tactics, and so on.",
      "The “good player” trap is one that many United fans and people working in the media either keep falling for or ignore the true context of the situation to push a narrative. Antony and Rashford always showed potential to perform at the levels they have after leaving on loan, but how often did they show that level before leaving? Yes, anyone would probably present an upgrade to Hojlund at this moment, but the team underperformed with them there, and sometimes their body language made it seem like it was everyone’s fault but theirs.",

We need to take a deep breath, allow the current manager to sign at least 5 players and see what the performances and results are like then.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana features twice, but one Brighton player had three absolute stinkers – earning him a hat-trick of shame in this ranking of the 10 worst performances in the Premier League this season.",

      "It was Verbruggen’s awful pass that gifted Alex Iwobi the opening goal on a chilly Thursday night in December; Igor Julio’s pass back to the Dutchman was terrible, but Verbruggen still had plenty of time to play a risky – but much less risky – pass back to Igor or simply launch it up the pitch and out of harm’s way. Instead, he tried to be cute and failed to find Carlos Baleba – and even if he had, the Brighton midfielder was completely swarmed.",
      "Every team wants to play out from the back these days, and that’s absolutely fine (and not woke), but come on – sometimes you just need to get the ball away from your goal. When in doubt, kick it out.",
      "",
      "9) Bart Verbruggen (Chelsea 4-2 Brighton) – 4.54\nSeriously…you again?",
      "In one of only five 10/10s on WhoScored this season, Cole Palmer smashed four past the Netherlands No. 1 in the first half of Chelsea’s convincing win over Fabian Hurzeler’s Brighton.",
      "If Robert Sanchez’s performance (4.86 rating) was shocking, then Verbruggen’s was…well, something far worse. Yes, Palmer was outstanding, but he’ll forever be thankful for the opposition goalkeeper’s generosity on the day he became the first Premier League player to score four times in the first half of a match.",
      "",
      "8) Harry Clarke (Brentford 4-3 Ipswich) – 4.50\nOn his first ever Premier League start, no less, Harry Clarke put in a performance Jonathan Woodgate would have been proud of. The Arsenal academy graduate was given the nod at right-back up against Keane Lewis-Potter and ended up conceding a penalty four minutes into the second half, getting booked in the process, and then being sent off for a second yellow card in the 69th minute.",
      "He started three more times between that October defeat and his January departure for Sheffield United. He’s only on loan at Bramall Lane, and the fact he has six appearances, just 473 minutes played, and three yellow cards for the third-best team in the Championship probably hammers home the fact that he’s not quite Premier League level.",

      "7) Will Hughes (Newcastle 5-0 Crystal Palace) – 4.47\nEvery time he plays, you know what to expect from Will Hughes – who very rarely produces a stinker, especially not to the extent he did at St James’ Park in April.",
      "He committed an error leading to a goal, made four fouls, picked up a yellow card, conceded four goals, misplaced five passes, lost five of six duels, lost possession six times and won it only once, and made zero interceptions, clearances, or tackles. Newcastle were brilliant and ruthless, but Hughes and Palace were weirdly toothless.",
      "",
      "6) Andre Onana (Manchester United 1-3 Brighton) – 4.41\nAmazingly, a Verbruggen c*ck-up cost Brighton a penalty that Bruno Fernandes more than happily converted to equalise. But the second half was all about Andre Onana and his disastrous attempts to keep the Seagulls at bay.",
      "Well…we’re not entirely convinced that was even his objective. Brighton’s second came after Onana decided to retreat rather than deal with a cross he should’ve at least punched clear. And for the third, he rightly came out to collect a cross – only to spill it straight into the path of Georginio Rutter.",
      "He’s made some stinking errors for United, and that one is right up there.",
      "F365 SAYS: Nimble Brighton show why Manchester United remain anchored to depths under Ruben Amorim",

      "5) Andre Onana (Manchester United 2-3 Nottingham Forest) – 4.37\nJust like Verbruggen, Onana goes back-to-back.",
      "The Cameroonian made zero saves and conceded three goals against Forest, including an error leading to a goal after somehow getting wrong-footed by a Morgan Gibbs-White shot. We’re still not sure how. Chris Wood’s strike to make it 3-1 didn’t officially go down as an error, but it really should have. It was a collective mess at the back post with Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez, and Onana all looking like deer caught in the headlights.",
      "If Ruben Amorim had more money to spend this summer, replacing Onana would surely be part of the rebuild that might lift United from 16th in the Premier League up to, let’s say, 11th.",
      "",
      "4) Bernd Leno (West Ham 3-2 Fulham) – 4.36\nIt’s been a rough ride for Premier League goalkeepers this season – a high-risk position, the last line of defence, and one where most errors result in goals.",
      "Away to West Ham, Leno clearly had some sympathy for the opposition and did his best to give them their first win under Graham Potter. Carlos Soler’s opener came from a calamitous pass by Andreas Pereira, but we all know Leno shouldn’t have given him the ball under such a high press. Go long, man!",
      "The German should’ve done better with Tomas Soucek’s goal to make it 2-0, and for the third… just wow. Caught lacking, Danny Ings’ press proved too much and his blocked pass fell straight to Lucas Paqueta. Leno knew he’d messed up, too. His half-hearted arm flap was more telling than his facial expression.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Man Utd 0-3 Liverpool) – 4.26\nOnly three home players make this top (or bottom) 10 — and they all play for Manchester United. That is so Manchester United.",
      "In the battle of the two bald Dutchmen, Liverpool boss Arne Slot comfortably beat Erik ten Hag, who would soon lose his job. Slot had some Casemiro mishaps to thank for the emphatic victory, with the Real Madrid legend earning the worst match rating for an outfielder this season.",
      "Casemiro was hooked at half-time after surely receiving a few verbal hooks in the dressing room, having committed two errors leading to goals on a chastening afternoon (to put it lightly).",
      "He attempted an eye-of-the-needle pass for Liverpool’s opener, only for Ryan Gravenberch to intercept and lay it off to Mohamed Salah, who found Luis Díiz at the back post. For the Reds’ second, Casemiro had his pocket picked by Diaz, and a quick transition ended with the Colombian sweeping home past Onana.",
      "Clearly giving up, Casemiro sat on his knees and watched Liverpool storm forward for a solid three seconds before getting up and trotting back. He should’ve taken Jamie Carragher’s advice and just ‘left the football’.",
      "",
      "2) Bart Verbruggen (Nottingham Forest 7-0 Brighton) – 3.95\nThis surely marked the final straw for Fabian Hurzeler, who may well have dished out a Homer-style “Why you little…” strangle after the eldest Simpson child’s namesake turned in a third disastrous performance of the season – on his 22nd Premier League appearance of 2024/25.",
      "Conceding seven will obviously obliterate a goalkeeper’s match rating, but the cherry was plopped on top of the cake of sh*t when Verbruggen passed the ball straight to Jota Silva and was promptly nutmegged by the shot to seal a tight and nervy 7-0 win for Nuno Espirito Santo’s men.",
      "",
      "1) Arijanet Muric (Man City 4-1 Ipswich) – 3.29\nThe worst rating ever dished out to a Premier League player – Arijanet Muric had an absolute mare against his former club on matchday two.",
      "After finishing the previous season relatively well in goal for Burnley, Muric was snapped up by Ipswich to be their new No.1. He missed the opening match against Liverpool, but Kieran McKenna brought him in for the trip to the Etihad – and what followed was a complete disaster.",
      "Two errors leading to goals, zero saves, four goals conceded, 10 misplaced passes, and 11 instances of lost possession…that’s apparently what it takes to earn the worst Premier League match rating of all time, if you were wondering.",
      "READ NEXT: Premier League winners and losers: Everton, West Ham, Vardy, Newcastle without Isak, Arsenal…",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and come out well on top.",
      "A talented new name has emerged in Man Utd’s hunt for a goalkeeper, with two departures between the sticks expected this summer, according to reports.",

When designs for the 100,000-seater arena were unveiled, they were greeted with ridicule for their striking resemblance to a circus top – a fitting home for what has been a clown show of a team for much of the past decade.",

      "The so-called ‘umbrella roof’, however, will be equipped with solar panels and a rain-harvesting system to reduce the stadium’s reliance on non-renewable energy sources. The energy efficiency of the arena has been devised in order to align with Manchester’s 2038 carbon-neutral target.",

      "Game to watch: Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester United\nSomehow, this is where we’re at. The teams 16th and 17th in the Premier League have stumbled into the Europa League final, which takes place in Bilbao on Wednesday evening. To hammer home just how s**t these two have been domestically: both have one win in their last 10 league games – that’s fewer than Leicester City, and the same as Ipswich Town.",
      "That both are woefully out of form actually adds to the spectacle. Football, like boxing, is often at its best when it’s messy. The higher the quality, the more cagey it gets. The worse and more vulnerable the fighters, the more likely someone gets sparked. In other words: chaos incoming.",
      "These two have already met three times this season. Spurs have won all three, with an aggregate score of 8-3. So obviously, Manchester United will win. That’s how football works, innit? Also, it’s Spurs. In a final.",
      "For all the stick United have received post-Sir Alex Ferguson, they’ve actually won two cup finals in the last two seasons, and if you include the Community Shield and UEFA Super Cup, they’ve gone seven for 12 in finals since 2013. Spurs in that time have lost three out of three finals and have only won one trophy in the 21st century.",
      "We all know Spurs’ pot-dodging ways, but Ange Postecoglou insisted he wins things in second seasons. It would be the least Spursy thing ever for him to deliver on that promise, and it would allow him to leave with his head held high. Lose, and it’s hard to see him managing in the Premier League again. He needs this, and Spurs need this, to end a ridiculous 17-year trophy drought.",
      "Ruben Amorim, meanwhile, is expected to be in the Old Trafford dug-out next season, regardless of the result. But he needs this too, for the Champions League football, and the money that comes with it, to paper over the cracks of United’s worst-ever Premier League finish.",
      "It’s hard to predict the score – but we’re willing to stick our necks out and predict plenty of chaos, mistakes, and entertainment.",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Crystal Palace\nThere’s a tiny winy chance that Crystal Palace will still be hungover or half-p*ssed for Tuesday’s Premier League clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers – and who could blame them? On Saturday, they made history by winning their first-ever major trophy, and now return home to a boisterous, euphoric Selhurst Park.",
      "It promises to be a carnival atmosphere, and you’d hope that only fuels the fire for Oliver Glasner’s side to put on a show for a fanbase still floating somewhere above south London. With European football already secured, and the pressure off, Palace can play with complete freedom – and that’s a terrifying prospect for any opponent.",
      "Wolves have nothing left to play for beyond the moral victory of finishing above Manchester United and Spurs – which, let’s be honest, would be a laugh but hardly season-defining. They’ve also lost two on the bounce without scoring, and this might not be the occasion to turn things around.",
      "Momentum has the potential to be everything and Palace are absolutely riding the wave",

      "Manager to watch: Pep Guardiola\nSo, Pep Guardiola overthought another final. Of course he did. As a result, Manchester City have finished FA Cup runners-up two years in a row. Now that a trophyless season is confirmed, attention turns back to the Premier League – where City have a big job to do.",
      "Bournemouth come to the Etihad to face what you’d assume will be a motivated City side, hell-bent on righting their Wembley wrongs with an emphatic performance. A win would at least help secure Champions League qualification, which is still not a done deal.",
      "On the same weekend they lost to Crystal Palace, all of their top-five rivals – except Newcastle United – won. And it was Arsenal who beat them, ensuring City now need a miraculous goal swing and for the Gunners to lose to actual Southampton on the final day to sneak second place.",
      "That particular target – and the hilarious prospect of Arsenal finishing third in a two-horse race behind City again – can be forgotten. The focus for Guardiola now is to get a reaction.",
      "Expect changes. To what extent, who knows? Matheus Nunes at right-back wouldn’t be a surprise. Ilkay Gundogan or Nico Gonzalez could come in to add some midfield steel, and Kevin De Bruyne will surely keep his place after being the only City player to show up at Wembley.",
      "Guardiola looked rattled after being out-tacticed by Oliver Glasner, though he did take time to congratulate Palace on their first major trophy in 119 years. But a Dean Henderson masterclass, plus a slice of luck, clearly p**sed Pep off – and honestly, who could blame him after the Palace goalkeeper got away with a red card?",
      "That’s history now. The only priority is preparing his side for a must-win game. Fail to beat Bournemouth, and suddenly that final-day trip to Fulham starts to look a lot more sticky.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Heung-min Son\nSeveral Spurs players have the chance to win their first major trophy on Wednesday – and Heung-min Son is one of them. That might come as a surprise, considering his world-class ability over much of the last decade, but it makes perfect sense: he’s spent 11 years at Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "And no, we’re not counting the Asian Games he won with South Korea’s Under-23s at the age of 26. He got military exemption for that – and that’s plenty, Clive.",

      "Son needs this – to justify his decision to stay, and to give his CV something it badly lacks. But right now, Spurs need him more than ever. In a season full of underwhelming performances, Postecoglou is without his two main playmakers in Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison, meaning much of the creative burden now falls on the South Korean.",
      "It’s been a disappointing campaign for both player and club – but there’s hope that Son’s superstar quality could finally shine through to deliver Spurs’ first major trophy since 2008.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 15 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.5\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",
      "",
      "",
      "4) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.2% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, leaving him level with David Raya for the Golden Gloves award.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final.",
      "",
      "6) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "7) Alisson (Liverpool): +2.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more. Remarkably, he made nine saves v Brighton as a sloppy Liverpool lost 3-2.",
      "",
      "8) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "9) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "12) David Raya (Arsenal): +0.9\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.1\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "14) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.1\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it matters have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -1.8\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton.",
      "",
      "17) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -2.6\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -3.5\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded more than Fulham this season.",
      "",
      "19) Jose Sa (Wolves): -4.1\nSaved a penalty v Leicester City to keep his seventh clean sheet of the season.",
      "",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "Tuesday 20 May 2025 18:31, UK",
      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is set to join Man Utd at the end of the season; United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wants to play for United and SSN has been told the deal is almost agreed",
      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:18, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Tuesday 20 May 2025 12:07, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows previews the Europa League final and outlines where the value lies as Spurs and Manchester United look to save their seasons.",
      "This is a beautifully grotesque final. Both teams are balancing on the highwire with no safety net below them.",
      "We can get carried away with overdramatising the outcomes of football matches but this one truly is huge, especially for Tottenham, who have one game to decide whether it's been their best or worst season for many years. It's a ridiculous situation, really.",
      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."

      "Crueller observers might speculate that 'tough to watch' is a fitting preview of the forthcoming final between two of Berbatov's former clubs, Manchester United and Tottenham. Both have endured particularly miserable Premier League seasons.",
      "Incredibly, since the two teams met in London in mid-February, neither has managed to beat an opponent that will be competing in next season's Premier League - their only victories coming against the relegated trio. In Bilbao, it will be 16th against 17th.",
      "\"Some will say maybe it is not fair when one of them wins and goes to the Champions because they did not earn it or qualify in the proper way. But it is what it is and it is going to be an interesting game now because their backs are against the wall,\" says Berbatov.",
      "\"Finals are about concentration, about not making silly mistakes, because you could be punished and there is no rematch. Maybe we will be surprised and it will be an open game but I expect caution, nobody wanting to take risks. Their seasons are on the line.",
      "\"The only thing that can justify either season now is lifting that trophy. Who needs it more? That is the question. United have been going backwards while others gone forwards. Spurs have not won a trophy in 17 years. So in a way, both managers need it.",
      "\"Ange Postecoglou, he can say, 'I told you, I always win something in my second season. Now shut up.' Or Ruben Amorim can say, 'Trust me, this is the system that we are going to play and now we can build for United's next season with that trophy'.\"",
      "It was Berbatov himself who scored the goal when Tottenham won the 2008 League Cup final - their last piece of silverware. They came from behind that day at Wembley to beat a strong Chelsea side. \"We were the underdogs, we had nothing to lose,\" he remembers.",
      "\"That was the Chelsea of Didier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, some great players. But we knew that we would have our chances to score because we scored a lot of goals, that team, especially up front with me and Keano (Robbie Keane).",
      "\"Everybody expected Chelsea to win. Drogba scored a great free-kick but we kept going.\" Berbatov equalised from the penalty spot and Jonathan Woodgate won the cup in extra-time. \"Sometimes that is all you need, a penalty or a corner kick or whatever.\"",
      "Berbatov has had his own frustrations in finals, of course. In the 2002 Champions League final, his Bayer Leverkusen team were edged out by Real Madrid's superstars in an even game at Hampden Park. A moment of magic from Zinedine Zidane decided it.",
      "\"It was probably the greatest ever goal in a Champions League final. There was nothing you could do. The ball just landed at the feet of the one player you do not want the ball to land to. In football, sometimes even your best is not good enough. It is a cruel game.\"",
      "It was cruel in 2011 too. Despite being the joint-top scorer in the Premier League that season, sharing the Golden Boot with Carlos Tevez, Berbatov was surprisingly omitted not just from the United team for the Champions League final but the entire squad.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has since apologised for the move - he started Javier Hernandez, with Michael Owen preferred on the bench. Does Berbatov understand the call yet? \"Not personally but Sir Alex obviously admitted that he probably made a mistake,\" he says.",
      "\"My confidence was sky high. You are king of the world or that is how I felt. In every game, you think you are going to score. But even if I did play, I do not know if it would have made any difference because at that time Barcelona had prime Lionel Messi!\"",
      "Berbatov left United for Fulham at the end of the following season, with Ferguson calling time on his long reign at Old Trafford just one year after that. The Scottish legend bowed out with yet another Premier League title but United have been in decline ever since.",
      "\"United remain massive around the world, but it is a long time since that last Premier League and that way of thinking, that mentality of going to win every game, it has faded away,\" says Berbatov, speaking in his role as a LiveScore European brand ambassador.",
      "\"United have been struggling for years and that is painful, of course. Everybody knows that - the fans, the management, the coaches and the players as well. That is why this game is so important, so they can say, 'Look, we are struggling but we still won a trophy'.",
      "\"In the past few years, it has always been about how next season is going to be ours - and the next season. Again, we are in that position where next season, let us hope that the new manager can do it. As cliched as it sounds, you always have to keep the faith.",
      "\"Keep that faith and hope Ruben, with a pre-season behind him, will not start over, but maybe bring in the players he wants because he is not going to change, he loves that system. So you need players specifically to fit that system and hope the results come.\"",
      "Is there a suspicion that United just seem to find a way? Berbatov talks of them having \"a DNA that they need to win trophies\" while Spurs' wait goes on. But he is conflicted. \"I do not think it is that Spurs do not have belief. It is a tough question to answer,\" he says.",
      "\"On the one hand, there is the DNA of the club, the history, everything you have won before, and you know that the expectation from everybody is that you will win in the end. On the other hand, maybe if you are not expected to win then there is nothing to lose.",
      "\"Sometimes football can be a cruel game and there is just no explanation for it. You just go out there with your best intentions, you are fully concentrated, you are all ready to go, all your first-team players are ready and they play and then it just does not happen.\"",
      "Either way, Berbatov will be watching. Just do not ask him who he wants to win. \"I will sympathise with the loser because I have been there, winning finals and losing finals. Football will remind me again that there is so much joy but so much pain as well.\"",

      "Luis Castro’s long career began in Portugal’s fourth division and has seen him rise to become one of the most accomplished coaches in world football. Football has taken the Portuguese to four different countries, winning trophies in all four of them.",
      "He was the first man to win Portugal's second tier with a B team, finished sixth with little Chaves and took Vitoria Guimaraes into Europe. Castro then won the title in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk before embarking on a new adventure in South America.",
      "When he left Botafogo in 2023, the Brazilian club were seven points clear at the top of the table and he finished that calendar year as the coach with the most wins in world football over the past 12 months - there were 51 of them, four clear of Pep Guardiola.",
      "All of which is a rather long-winded way of saying that, for all this, Castro knows by now the first question that is coming his way. That is because his most recent appointment was in Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr. So, what exactly is it like coaching Cristiano Ronaldo?",
      "Al Nassr won the Arab Club Champions Cup under Castro, the victory coming after extra-time courtesy of two goals by you know who. In total, Ronaldo scored 55 goals in 55 games under his management. \"We shared some great moments together.\"",
      "Does Castro have any special insight into how it is that Ronaldo continues to pummel goals for club and country even after turning 40? \"What set his apart is what happens before and after training - the so called 'invisible training' that he does,\" he explains.",
      "\"His behavior is all tailored towards sports performance - his diet, his sleep, and his recovery. He is a person deeply concerned with eating well, sleeping well and preparing his body properly. In my opinion, this is clearly where Cristiano's longevity comes from.\"",
      "Did it inspire others? \"Of course,\" he replies. \"Every positive example helps us grow. Our parents, our friends.\" Did he learn from Ronaldo as well? \"Coaches learn from players. Anyone who thinks they know everything becomes stuck. It is a very limiting mindset.\"",
      "Given that Erik ten Hag saw no role for Ronaldo at Manchester United, in part because of the player's inability or unwillingness to press from the front, one wonders what exactly he makes of that decision. \"We look at each player and we adjust things,\" he explains.",
      "\"We adjust according to their identity. That is exactly what I do - with Cristiano and with everyone else. That is my duty as a leader, as a coach. Our job means we have to look at the group of players and get the most out of them as a team. I have no doubt about that.",
      "\"That is why we need to find a system that enhances the players that we have. I cannot stick rigidly to a tactical system and refuse to change. I cannot just go to the end with my idea, no matter what, because that would lead to failure and disaster.\"",
      "It is interesting to hear a coach of such experience talk about the need to adapt his ideas. At the age of 63, Castro is still making those adjustments - because the game demands it. \"Football has evolved and not only the tactical systems,\" he acknowledges.",
      "\"Science has become intertwined with the game. The media are much more active. Player representation has changed. Coaching staffs have increased significantly in number and their areas of expertise. We all have to adapt to match this evolution.",
      "\"The intensity has increased, which has forced us to change our training methodologies and focus more on player recovery. We had to evolve in the tools we use and become much more comprehensive and knowledgeable about everything that surrounds us.",
      "\"A coach must be much more strategic now. In the past, coaches could be known for their tactical system. Today, I have to give my team the versatility to understand multiple systems, to make faster decisions because there is less and less room for hesitation.",
      "\"Today, it is about reading the game, solving situations. We create exercises to address these tactical changes and respond to the tactical shifts during a game, to overcome those challenges posed by the opponent and to put the opposition in difficulty too.\"",
      "In Castro's view, this represents a major change in how coaches need to approach football. \"Training sessions are much richer now. There has been a radical shift in how we look at training and how we prepare players for the various phases of a game.\"",
      "Some developments he is not so fond of. He has spoken of how youngsters are more focused on the individual than the team, but he stops short of suggesting it is a problem. \"It does require constant reminders about what teamwork should be,\" he says.",
      "\"But through good communication, the players always end up understanding and following the team path. We, as coaches, also need to recognise that the individualistic players remain assets. It is the job of the coach to connect them to the team.\"",
      "The appetite remains - Castro describes doing that as \"fantastic\" - and Portuguese coaches are proving better at it than most. There are three of them working in the Premier League at present - Ruben Amorim, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Marco Silva.",
      "\"The Premier League is the biggest showcase in world football. It is the best league in the world and has the best professionals working in it so I have no doubt that if they are there, it is because they are of excellent quality, taking a successful path to get there.",
      "\"I do not really like distinguishing coaches by nationality as quality has no nationality. But I can speak about our coaching school because it has managed to combine scientific knowledge, academic background, and the other experiences of football perfectly.",
      "\"Many of us Portuguese coaches worked in academies, which helped us to understand younger players - development programs, methodologies, and all the factors that shape a player's identity. It is about how we put individual talent into the service of the team.\"",
      "A lesson that Luis Castro learned with Cristiano Ronaldo."

      "Man Utd lost their 18th league game of the season in a 1-0 loss at Chelsea; Roy Keane thinks defeat in the Europa League final would destroy the club's pulling power; Keane: \"I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Man Utd. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club\"",
      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""
