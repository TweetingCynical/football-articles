      "Mo Salah has put clubs in Saudi Arabia on red alert with his explosive comments regarding his future at Liverpool. The Egyptian forward was already a target for multiple Saudi Pro League clubs before dropping a bombshell on Saturday night by revealing that he feels he's been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool, adding that he has 'no relationship' with boss Arne Slot.",
      "Someone who could replace him at Anfield is Bournmeouth's Antoine Semenyo, who's been tipped for a transfer by his own manager - at international level, that is. Manchester United have also been linked but they've got their own want-away star, as Kobbie Mainoo continues to search for regular playing time.",
      "The January transfer window may not be open for another 24 days but things are heating up, even as we remain in the thick of an action-packed Premier League season.",
      "Barcelona are reportedly mulling over a deal for a new defender despite winter businesses having been put on hold.",
      "According to Sport, club chiefs could change their mind in January, depending on how the rest of the year plays out. Ronald Araujo remains out of contention for the La Liga side.",
      "Pau Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Andreas Christensen and Gerard Martin are their remaining options but it is suggested that any injuries could potentially open the door to business.",
      "Ex-Liverpool star Danny Murphy has issued his verdict on Mo Salah following his explosive comments.",
      "He said: \"Knock on the manager's door, go and speak with the CEO or whoever you might need to. Go and see the owners. Do whatever you've got to do. Express your frustration.",
      "\"By doing what he's done, he's causing the manager and the team a problem and he's making it all about him. You just can't do it. Whether you agree with him being left out or not, you don't deal with it like this.\"",
      "Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo has been heavily linked with leaving in January.",
      "Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham are all said to be interested, with the 25-year-old forward having a £65million release clause.",
      "Semenyo's manager for Ghana, Otto Addo, told The Athletic at Friday's World Cup draw: \"He has done very well at Bournemouth, but with all the respect for Bournemouth and what they're doing, surely it is natural for him to take the next step.",
      "\"Whether its in the winter or summer, it is a difference question but it won’t make a difference for us. I'm looking forward to him showing more of what he can to the world.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly desperate to leave Manchester United next month in a bid to save his World Cup hopes.",
      "Mainoo, 20, has only started one game this season and Italian champions Napoli are interested in signing him, according to the Mail.",
      "The midfielder's contract with United expires in 2027.",
      "Remarkable stuff from Mo Salah last night.",
      "The Liverpool star admits that he could suddenly leave Anfield after his relationship with Arne Slot broke down.",
      "Salah, 33, has also claimed that the club have 'thrown him under bus', hinting that his final game for Liverpool could be as soon as NEXT WEEK.",

      "Despite any ongoing tensions between Manchester United and Marcus Rashford, the Premier League giants clearly think a lot of their player. Rashford has been rejuvenated on loan at Barcelona this season and could join the Spanish powerhouse permanently in the summer.",
      "However, United have taken the initiative by bestowing a new title upon the player in the middle of his season. And it's one that could cause consternation among some fans given his standing with the club at the time of his departure.",
      "There was a time when Rashford seemed destined for icon status at Old Trafford after he first emerged as a first-team star in early 2016. A lot has transpired over the past decade, and his bond appeared shattered when he first left on loan for Aston Villa almost one year ago.",
      "The relationship was only further complicated when his loan to Barca, complete with a very affordable purchase option, was confirmed in the summer. But United have shown their character by filing Rashford under the 'Legends' section on their official website.",
      "The 28-year-old joins exclusive company, with the likes of Sir Bobby Charlton, Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Wayne Rooney and Denis Irwin also in that section. The decision reflects United's perception of the player despite all that has transpired in recent years.",
      "It's understood Rashford's relationship with manager Ruben Amorim soured at one point as his career took a negative turn. But while he may not be shining for the Red Devils at present, it clearly doesn't diminish all he has achieved in red.",
      "Prior to leaving the club on temporary terms, Rashford helped the club secure two FA Cups, a Europa League title and two League Cups. So, while others in the Legends section may have succeeded in more prosperous times, Rashford is still recognised for helping ensure the club remained relevant in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "It's not quite the Camp Nou, but United prospect Toby Collyer was beginning to show some promise at the Hawthorns this season. The 21-year-old joined West Brom in the summer, with a view to gaining valuable minutes before he returned to Old Trafford next year.",
      "However, Collyer has returned to Manchester sooner than expected after suffering an injury Baggies boss Ryan Mason called \"quite serious.\" And it puts his future prospects with the Championship side in doubt.",
      "\"It's quite a big injury,\" Mason told BBC Radio WM. \"He's at United at the minute where they're assessing him and then in the coming weeks we'll decide his plan regarding his rehab.",
      "\"We've got him on loan for the season and normally any loan player that gets an injury that's a bit more than a small one, more a significant one, it's only right for the parent club to look at them, check them over, and we're in dialogue and hopefully he can do his rehab and come back better.\"",
      "Collyer has made 13 first-team appearances for United to date and was being tipped as one with potential to earn a place in Amorim's plans. He has racked up 12 outings for West Brom to date and enjoyed a brief spell in the starting line-up earlier this season prior to a separate setback.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sergio Reguilon's football exile is nearing its end, it has been claimed. The former Manchester United and Tottenham left-back has been without a club since leaving North London in June and has needed to be patient.",
      "Now, though, he's set to get his reward. Reports in the autumn suggested Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were keen on bringing the Spanish international to Major League Soccer, and an announcement is said to be close.",
      "According to Marca (via Sport Witness), Reguilon is Inter's 'Plan A' as they look to replace Jordi Alba. Champions League winner Alba is set to retire after this weekend's MLS Cup final against Vancouver Whitecaps, as is team-mate Sergio Busquets, and the Spanish outlet reports that Reguilon's arrival as a replacement for Alba is a 'done deal'.",
      "The same publication indicates Reguilon has been 'training extensively' on his own while unattached. The 28-year-old hasn't played a minute of senior football since May, when he earned a rare start for Spurs against Aston Villa - one of just six appearances he made last term.",
      "An announcement might not be immediate, but could come in the next few days. First, the club plan to give Alba a proper farewell as he bows out.",
      "“I can’t tell you how the experience will be because I’ll live it in the moment,” said Alba. The 36-year-old, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, has 11 goals and 29 assists in his 65 MLS games - as well as one goal and six assists in playoff appearances - after linking up with former Barca colleagues Messi, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suarez.",
      "“My last game with Barcelona was very emotional, exciting, because I knew it was the last time I’d wear that shirt that gave me so much. But this is everything. It’s not about going from one team to another. It’s leaving soccer. Obviously, it’s a bigger step.”",
      "Reguilon began his career with Barcelona's great rivals Real Madrid before winning the Europa League during a loan spell with Sevilla. That earned him a move to Jose Mourinho's Spurs in 2020, but he managed just 73 appearances for the club.",
      "He had three loan spells during his time in North London, picking up minutes for Atletico Madrid, Manchester United and Brentford. The United stint was particularly brief, with Reguilon playing just 655 minutes under Erik ten Hag before United triggered an option to cut the loan short.",
      "\"It has been great to play for Manchester United and I just want to say thank you to the club, the fans and my teammates,\" he said after the spell came to an end. \"It was a privilege to play for this huge club. I wish all the best for the Red Devils.\"",

      "Manchester United have honoured out-on-loan star Marcus Rashford by including him in the legends section of their official website - as he continues to shine on loan at FC Barcelona. Rashford joined United's academy at just seven-years-old.",
      "The forward made his senior debut in 2016 during a Europa League match against Midtjylland, scoring twice and becoming the club's youngest-ever goal-scorer in European competition at that time. Over the following decade, Rashford became a beloved figure at Old Trafford and one of the Premier League's top forwards.",
      "His 2022/23 season was particularly impressive, with a tally of 30 goals and nine assists across all competitions. However, since Ruben Amorim took over as United's head coach last November, Rashford's status with the club deteriorated, which led to an exit during the summer transfer window.",
      "Despite Amorim not seeing Rashford as part of his long-term plans, the club have now decided to recognise his contributions. United have added Rashford to the legends section of their website - placing him alongside some huge names and the most revered players in the club's history.",
      "Rashford now shares the status with such icons as Sir Bobby Charlton, Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Wayne Rooney, Denis Irwin and many other Old Trafford luminaries.",
      "He's one of only four players on the list who are still playing - along with Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and David De Gea. Of those, only Fernandes is, of course, currently playing for the club.",
      "While Rashford remains on United's books, his longer-term future hinges on Barcelona's decision over whether to make his loan move permanent.",
      "The Catalan giants have an option to buy the England international for approximately £26million but, despite his impressive displays, there are concerns within the club about whether a permanent transfer makes financial sense.",
      "Barcelona are currently paying his full salary after Rashford accepted a 25 per cent wage reduction - although he still pockets around £240,000 per-week - placing him among the club's highest earners.",
      "Manager Hansi Flick has been full of praise for the United loanee. Earlier this season, he revealed: \"I told Deco this summer; 'Please get me a player like Marcus Rashford'... Please!",
      "\"I'm very happy to have him here. Rashford was an opportunity in the transfer market and we had to take it.",
      "\"I'm glad we did. I spoke to him and said; 'I need you in my team'.",

      "Gabriel Jesus and Max Dowman were left out of the Arsenal squad as they played in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Manchester United at St. George's Park. The Gunners were expected to bring at least one of the two players to Villa Park for the clash against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Both players were absent from the clash at Villa Park as Leandro Trossard cancelled out Matty Cash's first-half opener. Jesus has recently returned to first-team training following an extended spell on the sidelines. The 28-year-old striker suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury during Arsenal's defeat to Manchester United in the FA Cup third round at the start of the year.",
      "He had been in a rich vein of form, scoring three goals in his previous four Premier League games. Jesus has since returned to action at the Sobha Realty Training Centre, earning himself a place in the matchday squad against Chelsea and Brentford but was afforded the opportunity for minutes under his belt against the Red Devils.",
      "At the end of November, Arteta provided an update on the Brazil international's situation. Speaking to reporters ahead of the 3-1 win over Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League, the Arsenal boss said: \"Very good.",
      "\"He's doing everything with the team at the moment for the last almost two weeks. We're going to give him some exposure as well internally with some games, so he gets that fitness. But he looks really good in training, and he's going to be a big addition to the team.\"",
      "A few days later, Arteta confirmed that he and Ethan Nwaneri had participated in a behind-closed-doors friendly. The Spanish manager revealed: \"It did happen. Gabi participated, and Ethan as well, because he wanted some minutes.\"",
      "He added: \"We took the opportunity; they wanted a bit of exposure to competition, and providing that was very positive.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dowman has been somewhat of a rare sight for Arsenal this season. The 15-year-old midfielder made a few brief appearances at the start of the campaign, becoming the second-youngest player in both the club's and Premier League's history.",
      "After Dowman made his senior debut – at 15 years, 235 days – against Leeds United, a proud Arteta told the BBC: \"Very proud. Big credit to the academy and to everyone who has contributed to that journey.\"",
      "He continued, \"The families, hopefully they lived a beautiful day. The maturity and confidence and the joy he provides to the rest of the team is magnificent.\"",
      "He concluded with: \"Let's do it naturally and organically. We have to look after him and make sure we protect him as well.\"",
      "Shortly after making history, Dowman was given another brief appearance off the bench in the 1-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield. Since then, he hasn't featured in the English top-flight.",

      "Shaw has faced numerous hurdles since making the move, particularly with injuries. But he has now fought back from multiple setbacks to reclaim his place in the United squad.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, the England international has taken on a different role than earlier in his career. Instead of playing as a full-back who pushes on, he operates more as a left-sided centre-back.",
      "This change may help Shaw maintain his fitness for longer stretches of the season, with less physical demand placed on him than charging up and down the wings. Having returned to the starting line-up in recent weeks, Shaw made his 300th appearance for the club against Crystal Palace, contributing to a 2-1 victory at Selhurst Park.",
      "It was a milestone moment for Shaw, which the club celebrated by presenting him with a framed collection of photos and a shirt bearing the number 300. The presentation was made by director of football Jason Wilcox, who delivered a heartfelt speech in front of the rest of the staff in the canteen at Carrington.",
      "Whilst it proved to be a heart-warming occasion, Shaw reportedly felt embarrassed about the recognition, according to The Sun, who suggest he was unsure about the club creating such a fuss over the milestone.",
      "It was an achievement that has taken considerable time to reach, with the defender likely to have racked up far more appearances had it not been for his fitness problems.",
      "That was an observation made by United legend Denis Irwin, who praised Shaw on the Inside Carrington podcast. He said: \"He has been blighted with injuries, Luke, but I've got to say every manager, when he is fit, has picked him\".",
      "\"He has started every Premier League game this season so that tells you that Ruben is definitely backing him. He was brilliant [against Palace] and his recovery in a couple of tackles was needed by the way and particularly in the first half.",
      "\"It suits him to play in that left centre-half [role]. We know he can play the wing-back role, but relating it myself, I would have been more comfortable in that left centre-back role rather than being a wing-back. He has been fantastic for us this season.\"",

      "Paul Scholes' swipe at Ruben Amorim over his treatment of Kobbie Mainoo marks his latest tirade at a Manchester United boss. The United icon took umbrage with the manager's comments about Mainoo, who remained on the bench during United's draw with West Ham on Thursday.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder has yet to start a league game this campaign, being restricted to just 171 minutes in the Premier League. Despite this, Amorim had recently branded the England international a crucial player.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other players,\" Amorim said last Friday. \"I just have to make a choice and then in the end, it's not been Kobbie. In the future, I don't know. Again, I always think the same thing with Casemiro. [He] was not playing and then he plays. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing.\"",
      "Hitting back at Amorim on Instagram, Scholes wrote: \"Bulls***. The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Scholes has subsequently deleted his post about Mainoo. However, this is not the first time the 51-year-old has lashed out at a United manager, with Amorim's predecessors typically not surviving much longer after Scholes delivered a damning verdict.",
      "The pundit believed Erik ten Hag's tenure at the club was nearly over after United suffered a 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace in May 2024, although the side triumphed in the FA Cup final weeks later. Ten Hag was given a fresh contract but the Dutch manager only survived until October before Amorim took his place.",
      "\"Tonight almost felt like a final nail in the coffin,\" Scholes said after the Palace loss. \"There was a lack of know-how in the team, a lack of effort, going to a team like Crystal Palace, who are a good team and doing well, but Manchester United shouldn't be going there and doing 4-0.",
      "\"I felt for a while he [Ten Hag] might get another year and work for a club that has calmed down a little by the new owners but it doesn't feel like that now.\"",
      "Scholes had been equally blunt during Ralf Rangnick's stint as interim boss during the 2021/22 season. Rangnick was appointed with plans to subsequently take an advisory role but he opted to leave the club that summer.",
      "The United legend encapsulated his views about Rangnick's period in charge after a draw with Southampton in February 2022: \"One team have got a proper Coach, the other team has a sporting director.\"",
      "Following United's Champions League elimination the following month, Scholes delivered his assessment of Rangnick's role. \"How [Ralf Rangnick] was chosen to be manager of this club for six months, I don't know. Getting a proper coach for this team is a massive thing,\" he told BT Sport.",
      "\"There is some real talent in this squad. The very first thing this club needs to do to get anywhere near winning the league again is getting in a proper coach who works for this team.\"",
      "Despite Scholes' habit of predicting when United managers might be on their way out, there are reasons for Amorim to remain hopeful. In October, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe hinted that Amorim, who marked his first year at Old Trafford last month, would be evaluated after three years in charge.",

      "United have still won more Premier League titles than any other club, with the likes of Neville, Scholes and Keane involved in a number of those 13 title wins. The last of those came more than a decade ago, though, and United have arguably never looked further from returning to the summit.",
      "According to The Mail, this has prompted \"battle lines\" to be drawn between some current and former players. Criticism has arrived during studio broadcasts around United's league and cup games, and it has been reported that some feel the pundits could show more sympathy.",
      "\"The players feel the weight of what these guys say very deeply,\" an agent close to United's first team is quoted as saying by The Mail. \"They see all the clips and it really p****s them off. Their view is that these guys know what it’s like to feel the pressure of being a United player so they want some level of understanding from them but feel they don’t get it.",
      "\"Some players think the Class of '92 actually don’t want them to succeed so their own legacy can be protected. So, yeah, the relationship has been bad. The lads certainly don’t want to be interviewed by them for TV. It’s gone way beyond that\"",
      "Neville and Scholes aren't the only 'Class of 92' heroes - players who served United well after coming through the academy - to pass comment on the current crop. However, they, as well as one-time captain Keane, are the most prominent on TV and other media.",
      "Scholes, for his part, recently stepped away from TV work to care for his autistic son Aiden. \"He’s non-verbal so he can’t speak. When I say he can’t speak, I think he understands a lot more than we think,\" Scholes explained on the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"He has sounds but it’s only people that are close to him that will know what he’s saying. He has autism, but it’s like a really severe autism – because you can have it and go to school normally and such.\"",
      "United endured their worst ever Premier League campaign last season, with Erik ten Hag sacked after a poor start and successor Ruben Amorim leading the club to their first bottom-half finish in the competition. There have been green shoots of recovery this term, with Amorim's team eighth after 14 games, but there is still work to be done.",
      "Next up is a meeting with winless Wolves on Monday, and Amorim isn't underestimating the opposition. “Everything can happen, and that will change,\" he told reporters.",
      "\"There is no team in the Premier League history that didn't win one game. So, it can be any game. So, we need to try to improve, to rest the players, work really well, and prepare a tough match because, with us, it’s always a tough match.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jamie Carragher has reignited his long-running feud with Rio Ferdinand, who hosted the 2026 World Cup draw. The Liverpool legend took a swipe at his former England team-mate on social media when a clip surfaced of Ferdinand calling himself \"a man of the people\" while addressing the tournament's soaring ticket prices.",
      "The ex-Manchester United defender also addressed concerns over a proposed 'dynamic pricing' system, which some fear could push certain fans out of the market for match tickets. \"I am a man of the people in terms of I'm from a place where we were always hoping for things to be accessible,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"I know that the people behind the scenes at FIFA are aiming and working to something like that now, whether they get there for that remains to be seen. I think we have to be conscious of that and I think FIFA are definitely people who are conscious of that, the powers that be there.",
      "\"I think we can look at every industry, every sector, we have that conversation about things and I think it's more about making sure that there's a product that's super elite that matches what's on the pitch and then everyone can feel that it's justified taking time out and working hard to go and get tickets.\"",
      "In response, Carragher replied to the clip with three laughing-face emojis and three money-bag emojis, highlighting perceived hypocrisy given Ferdinand's immense wealth. By the next morning, Ferdinand had hit back, posting a photo of himself holding a newspaper featuring a doctored front page with his face on it and the headline \"Man of the People,\" while playfully tagging Carragher.",
      "Spats between the pair are nothing new. Over the years, the two Premier League icons - both now well-established media figures - have traded both subtle and not-so-subtle digs, whether during live broadcasts or on social media.",
      "Their most recent clash centred on Carragher's controversial comments about the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Back in February, the 47-year-old sparked backlash by suggesting the competition was not a \"major\" tournament.",
      "He argued that Mo Salah's Ballon d'Or prospects would not be significantly boosted by winning the AFCON - unlike a European player winning the Euros - because of the tournament's perceived lower prestige. Ferdinand, though, publicly rejected that view.",
      "\"The majority of people out there would say [what Carragher said] and I don't think that's right,\" he said. \"I think that's an ignorant thought process because the [Africa Cup of Nations]... if you go to Didier Drogba, Abedi Pele, Samuel Eto'o, Riyad Mahrez, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane they will tell you we have to win this.\"",
      "He added: \"I understand what Jamie is saying but I don't agree with it. But I understand that is the majority's fault and it's not right.\"",
      "Carragher hit back on Instagram, calling Ferdinand a \"clown\" and accusing him of misrepresenting his comments. \"I didn't say that, you clown - stop playing to the gallery like you always do,\" he wrote.",
      "A few days later, Ferdinand took another jab at Carragher after tennis legend Boris Becker called the Liverpool legend \"uninformed\" about Bayern Munich manager Vincent Kompany. After Bayern drew Bundesliga rivals Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League round of 16 last season, Carragher claimed that Kompany's future at the Allianz Arena would be in jeopardy if Bayern were knocked out.",
      "\"Bayern have not convinced me at all yet,\" he said. \"Now they are playing against Leverkusen, who dominated Bayern in the Bundesliga recently. It's a 50-50 tie. In the end, I'm predicting Leverkusen (to advance). If Kompany does not win, there will be many question marks about his appointment.\"",
      "Bayern fan Becker snapped back on X, reminding him that Die Roten were in fact very content with Kompany at the helm as he said: \"Jamie is NOT well informed at all\". Adding fuel to the fire, Ferdinand interjected, saying: \"Boris… he's having a bad couple weeks. Let him off.\"",
      "A year earlier, Carragher had branded Ferdinand a \"poor man's Virgil van Dijk\" and suggested he didn't belong in the debate over the Premier League's greatest-ever centre-back. During Liverpool's 4–1 win over Luton, Micah Richards captured Carragher's animated reaction to Van Dijk's equaliser from the CBS Sports studio.",
      "\"Look at the colossus, look at him, look at him! A marvel of modern science,\" Carragher beamed. \"He is the best centre-back the Premier League has ever seen, by a mile.\"",
      "Richards then asked how Van Dijk compared to other legendary centre-backs like Ferdinand, John Terry, Sol Campbell and Tony Adams. \"JT could play alongside him, I would allow that,\" Carragher replied. \"Ferdinand was a poor man's Van Dijk.\"",
      "The dig followed earlier accusations of hypocrisy and grandstanding between the pair over Saudi Arabia's growing influence in modern football. In recent years, the Saudi Pro League has lured a string of high-profile players with enormous salaries and transfer fees, prompting widespread claims of sportswashing as the country seeks to reshape its controversial global image.",
      "Speaking on his FIVE program, Ferdinand took aim at Carragher for refusing to condemn former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard after he took the reins at Al-Ettifaq. \"Jamie. Jamie Carragher. Where are you man? I heard a lot of talk, a lot of negativity about Saudi. Oh, Bernardo Silva, I can't believe it. It's a disgrace, it needs investigating, this league, etcetera,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"Steven Gerrard's gone. You used to carry his boots and his bag at Anfield to games. Your boy's gone over there and I've not heard a peep out of you. I've not heard how disappointed you are. I want to see him say \"I can't believe Stevie's gone there\".",
      "However, Carragher would later hit back by accusing the 47-year-old of ducking questions over Qatar during the 2022 World Cup. \"I never criticised Silva, Benzema, Neves or SG [Steven Gerrard]. I don't like Saudi trying to buy football like they golf,\" he wrote in a post on X.",
      "\"I knew you'd be all over it @rioferdy5 [three money-mouth face emojis], like you were in Qatar! That's why you refused to do the opening game for @BBCMOTD [because you] didn't want to criticise your paymaster.\"",
      "Back in 2021, Ferdinand said he had to \"mute\" Carragher whenever the Liverpool legend discussed winning Premier League titles. \"Carragher shouldn't really talk about winning leagues,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"He's never done it. He doesn't know what it means. He doesn't know how to do it - he's never navigated a team to that point to win a league. So I find it very difficult when he speaks with such conviction about winning leagues. He should stick to cup competitions, the moment he starts talking about winning leagues, I just mute it.\"",
      "Hitting back at Ferdinand, Carragher posted: \"No [Premier League title] for me but Sky like my opinions! No [trophy] in your career without [Alex Ferguson] and when you stopped winning PL at [Manchester United] you tried to move to Chelsea so please stop giving it the big MU fan one!\"",
      "Ferdinand later claimed he was simply trying to provoke a response, posting an image calling Carragher's comeback the \"bite of the year.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ghana head coach Otto Addo believes Antoine Semenyo is ready to \"take the next step\" amid transfer links with Manchester United and Liverpool. The Bournemouth star faces an uncertain future on the South Coast with Premier League giants circling over a possible move.",
      "The Athletic previously reported that the Cherries were becoming increasingly resigned to losing the 25-year-old, who captained Andoni Iraola's against Everton last time out, in January with a £65million release clause set to become active. Both the Premier League champions and the Red Devils have been linked with his services, while Tottenham Hotspur expressed an interest in the summer before he signed a new deal.",
      "The attacker has been in fine form this season, sparking speculation over a move, with six goals and three assists in 13 Premier League outings.",
      "Addo believes it is a matter of time before Semenyo makes his big-money as he talked up the Ghana international's credentials.",
      "“He has done very well at Bournemouth, but with all the respect for Bournemouth and what they’re doing, surely it is natural for him to take the next step,\" he told The Athletic.",
      "“Whether its in the winter or summer, it is a difference question but it won’t make a difference for us. I’m looking forward to him showing more of what he can to the world.”",
      "Despite Bournemouth being decimated in the transfer window, losing the likes of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool, they managed to retain manager Andoni Iraola and winger Semenyo, with the pair continuing to impress.",
      "\"I've grown so much at the club, both on and off the pitch, and I'm really happy to have signed ahead of returning for pre-season,\" said Semenyo after signing a five-year deal",
      "\"From the fans to the staff and my teammates, I can't speak highly enough of the people around the club.",
      "\"It's a great place to be and I'm excited to get back to Bournemouth and continue the hard work with the new season just around the corner.\"",
      "After last season's 11-goal return, Semenyo netted twice in their season opener against Liverpool before Arne Slot's side scored late on to spare their blushes after squandering a two-goal lead.",
      "He has been linked with a move to Anfield in January as Mohamed Salah faces an uncertain future on Merseyside, despite having signed a new two-year deal earlier this year.",
      "The Egyptian is set to head to the Africa Cup of Nations this month and has had a below-par start to the season, where he has faced criticism for failing to replicate the form that fired Liverpool to the Premier League title last campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, United were linked with Semenyo's services during their pursuit of attacking reinforcements.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side moved to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko as part of their plan to improve their attacking output.",
      "Semenyo's £65 million release clause is said to have a deadline but is in place in order to allow Bournemouth sufficient time to source a replacement.",

      "Any concerns regarding Kobbie Mainoo's future at Manchester United were only exacerbated following a disappointing draw against West Ham. The academy gem was an unused substitute for the fourth time this season as the Hammers struck late to take a point from Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "Still waiting on his first Premier League start of the campaign, Mainoo continues to be all but frozen out Ruben Amorim. And one former United star has empathised with the youngster, suggesting he \"must be furious\" with his manager for how he's being treated.",
      "Another day, another United fixture in which Mainoo has watched largely as a spectator. And despite this being the kind of tetchy game in which the 20-year-old's composure on the ball could have been put to great use, he instead could only look on as his team dropped more valuable points.",
      "Once hailed as the brightest talent to emerge from United's youth ranks in some years, Mainoo appears almost written off by his manager. Murmurs have touted the midfielder for the exit for some time, with Napoli still being linked with a move for his signature next year.",
      "Ex-United defender Paul Parker could only sympathise with the player following his latest no-show. And the two-time Premier League champion could only theorise his relationship with Amorim must be at an all-time low as his chances of making the 2026 World Cup wilt away.",
      "\"I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake,\" Parker told MyBettingSites. \"He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup. He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.",
      "\"It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at [Scott] McTominay. I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out. It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.",
      "\"He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad, and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.\"",
      "That wasn't the only factor in the West Ham draw that drew a \"furious\" reaction. That's how set-piece coach Carlos Fernandes was described after Soungoutou Magassa levelled from a late corner at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "The Frenchman showed the sharpest reactions to convert a bobbling ball into the back of United's net in the 83rd minute on Thursday. And Fernandes' response summed up his emotions as he stormed back to his seat in angry fashion.",
      "Fernandes usually gets up from the dugout to take a closer look at set pieces, both in attack and defence. However, Magassa's late strike may have made him wish he hadn't bothered getting a better angle on this occasion.",
      "The hosts looked lethargic in responding as the ball bounced dangerously around the box in the build-up to Magassa's goal. And the end result was United missing their opportunity to move into the Premier League's top six following two more dropped points.",
      "The fruit of Fernandes' labour is evident in the fact United have drastically improved their threat from dead-ball situations this season. However, West Ham's goal at Old Trafford served as proof there's still work to be done defending those same scenarios.",

      "The night was packed with surprises - although some drew criticism from viewers - who were left scratching their heads at the lengthy duration of the draw. That's also not to mention the numerous segments put together by FIFA president Gianni Infantino.",
      "One of the major decisions of the night was appointing former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand as one of the key presenters for the event, with him taking the spotlight for the crucial moments. The ex-England player guided viewers through the process, breaking down why specific nations ended up in certain groups based on the draw regulations.",
      "During breaks between each pot selection, Hollywood actor Danny Ramirez mingled with the audience, as well, chatting to ex-footballers including ex-Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure.",
      "The former Ivory Coast star was quizzed about his nation's draw, before Ramirez made an awkward observation about Toure and Ferdinand in front of the assembled crowd.",
      "Ramirez said: \"I know you and Rio, you used to play for rival clubs. Are you guys friends now?\" Toure said in reply: \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "Ferdinand appeared somewhat irritated by the question, though, with the United great saying: \"Haha, what you trying to do here Danny? I know you're trying to get in the middle here, what are you doing?\"",

      "It capped off an awkward reunion for the duo - who had clashed numerous times during their Premier League careers. Ferdinand went head-to-head with Toure on 12 occasions throughout his playing days - securing three victories, drawing twice and suffering seven defeats, demonstrating who dominated that particular battle",

The 20-year-old midfielder experienced a meteoric rise at Old Trafford after breaking into the first team a few years ago, but his career has now stalled.",
      "Despite an injury-ravaged start to the 2023/24 season, Mainoo managed to secure a spot in the starting line-up under Erik ten Hag, making 24 Premier League appearances that campaign, most of them as a starter.",
      "Injuries once again marred his progress last season, but he still clocked up over 30 appearances across all competitions, even amidst a mid-season managerial change when Ruben Amorim took over from Ten Hag. However, after rumours of a potential move away surfaced towards the end of the summer transfer window, this season has taken a different turn for the England international.",
      "So far this season, Mainoo has only started one match, a Carabao Cup second-round tie against Grimsby Town at the end of August - a match that Amorim's side lost on penalties following a 2-2 draw in regular time.",
      "Mainoo has made appearances in nine out of United's 14 Premier League matches so far, but all have been as a substitute. Most recently, he was an unused substitute in the 1-1 draw at home against West Ham on Thursday evening.",
      "Following Mainoo's latest snub against the Hammers, a furious Paul Scholes took to Instagram to vent his frustration at the Reds head coach. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes posted in response to Amorim, who said last week he views Mainoo as a starter.",
      "\"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Only four senior members of United's squad have yet to make a Premier League start this season. Tom Heaton, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and, most worryingly, Mainoo.",
      "For most on that list, warming the bench is neither unexpected nor alarming. Heaton is third in line for the goalkeeper spot, Malacia was rumoured to be leaving in the summer and was part of the so-called 'bomb squad' with the likes of Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford as they sought transfers, while Martinez has only recently returned from nearly a year out due to a knee injury.",
      "For Mainoo, there's no such justification. So, it's hardly surprising that whispers of a transfer are resurfacing as the January window looms. Mainoo was linked with Napoli in the summer, where his teammate Rasmus Hojlund was loaned out during the same period.",
      "The harsh truth for Mainoo is that his current situation at United seems unlikely to change in the near future, with Amorim simply favouring other players. The club also continues to be associated with potential midfield reinforcements after a move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba fell through in the summer, which would further relegate Mainoo down the pecking order.",
      "In a World Cup year, time is running short, and Mainoo is fast losing chances to work his way back into Thomas Tuchel's thinking. Following his maiden senior England call-up in the spring last year, the midfielder hasn't featured in a Three Lions squad throughout this calendar year.",
      "The England manager was questioned about Mainoo's prospects earlier this season, but predictably pointed to insufficient playing time as the main factor behind his recent exclusions. \"He's lacking minutes,\" Tuchel revealed during a press conference.",
      "\"I don't think he lacks anything else. He has the experience, the power, the quality, the talent to be on our list - he is on our list - but in his position No6, No8, No10 we have players in full rhythm and play key parts in their clubs.\"",
      "Following such a promising start to his United career, it's disappointing that yet another academy product from the club might need to depart to revive his trajectory. While still relatively youthful, Mainoo clearly faces a crucial choice regarding his future in the coming weeks, as he simply cannot continue being sidelined and disregarded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are grappling with a tough decision regarding the future of Kobbie Mainoo. It comes as the midfielder contemplates a potential move in the January transfer window.",
      "The homegrown talent has found game time hard to come by under Ruben Amorim, who has favoured a double pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro this season. Mainoo has clocked up just 261 minutes on the pitch as a result, with only one start coming in the form of the Carabao Cup.",
      "With playing opportunities looking scarce, The Athletic reports that Mainoo is prepared to seek a loan move away from United in the January transfer window due to his frustration over lack of game time.",
      "The report also suggests that the club hasn't made a final decision yet and isn't expected to do so until after AFCON - which falls in the middle of the transfer window - due to the potential impact of players leaving for the tournament.",
      "This sets a timeline for when the academy star could depart, if United decide that an exit in the coming weeks is the best course of action. Mainoo remained on the bench during his team's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening, sparking fresh speculation about his future at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I see it [frustration]. I just want to win,\" Amorim said ahead of Monday's fixture against Wolves when questioned about whether Mainoo might feel disheartened by his selections.",
      "He added: \"I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case, was out, Bruno, he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "While Amorim has stood by his approach regarding Mainoo, United icon Paul Scholes has been far more critical of the manager following his recent remarks. Taking to Instagram, Scholes said: \"Bulls***. The kid's being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Whether Mainoo will be permitted to leave and develop his career elsewhere from January onwards remains uncertain, with significant decisions still pending.",
      "With ongoing speculation surrounding United and a potential midfield signing on the horizon, however, all signs suggest a possible departure for Mainoo.",

      "Former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand has been a household name for decades, having moved into football punditry after his illustrious playing career. The ex-England defender is considered a Premier League legend, winning six league titles before hanging up his boots.",
      "After being part of the broadcaster's coverage for a decade, he decided to leave to follow his other business interests. His final match for TNT was the Champions League final between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, which saw PSG emerge victorious.",
      "\"Since retiring from football, it has been a privilege talking about the game I love for a decade,\" the United icon said as he announced the move on social media. \"I want to acknowledge the tremendous support from the team behind the scenes, whose hard work often goes unseen but has been essential to our success.",
      "Ferdinand has relocated to Dubai alongside his family in a major lifestyle change. The location has become an increasingly attractive haven for British expats, drawn by the sunshine and tax laws.",
      "\"There's not one reason,\" he told The National as he explained why he made the move. \"I went for the Global Soccer Awards at Christmas and I hadn't been there properly for about seven or eight years. We spent time with some of Kate's friends who live there and I just saw a different side to it. I also have a business out there, Football Escapes.\"",
      "He added: \"In Dubai, it feels like they're valued and the lifestyle means that they're happy and vibrant with a good energy for the kids. Lifestyle, safety, weather - it's just a new life.",
      "\"When I made the decision, I thought, 'This must be 30 years when my life has been driven by the fixture list. Not now.' I'm not leaving football, but it's just not the governing body of my life now. I've got to be honest, it feels nice.",
      "\"The education system felt different, felt better for my kids. The children who are coming are 14, which is perfect because it's their two years of GCSEs starting this August. Then we've got a four and a two-year-old, so it's perfect timing for them as well.",
      "\"The curriculum is English curriculum, but it's just done a different way. I feel the teachers in the UK feel a little bit like undervalued, underpaid.\"",
      "Ferdinand's wife, Kate, who he married in 2019, took to social media to share her thoughts on their move to Dubai in August. The former The Only Way is Essex star said: \"A new chapter, a fresh start - because if we don't try, we'll never know.",
      "\"Ahhh! We've talked about this for so long, and now it's finally real... we're here we are making a new home in the place we met!",

      "Ferdinand is a father to three children from his previous marriage to Rebecca Ellison, who tragically died from cancer a decade ago. Since tying the knot with Kate, Ferdinand and his new wife welcomed their first child together in 2020.",
      "The Richest estimates that Ferdinand's net worth stands at around £57million, accumulated from his football earnings and post-playing income. MoneyInc reports that Ferdinand raked in a salary of £7m per year from his punditry work.",
      "During his playing days, he reportedly earned £6m annually at United, further contributing to his current wealth. While living in the UK, Ferdinand and his family lived in a lavish £4m mansion complete with a swimming pool, gym and expansive dressing room.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker believes Kobbie Mainoo \"must be furious\" at United boss Ruben Amorim for his lack of game time. Parker, part of the United squads which won the Premier League in 1993 and 1994, feels Mainoo may have to leave unless he gets an indication Amorim trusts him to start.",
      "Mainoo has played less than 200 minutes of league football this season, with each of his nine appearances coming from the bench, harming his hopes of a spot in England's World Cup squad. He was an unused substitute for Thursday's draw with West Ham.",
      "According to The Athletic, United are potentially prepared to sanction a January loan exit and the player is ready to move on. However, the club are said to be keen to wait until after the Africa Cup of Nations ends and Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are assessed following their exertions in Morocco.",
      "\"I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake,\" Parker said. \"He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup.",
      "\"He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned,\" added the ex-England defender, who was speaking to MyBettingSites, added.",
      "“It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at [Scott] McTominay. I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out. It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.”",
      "Mainoo has been linked with a move to Napoli, where McTominay has thrived since leaving Old Trafford. The Serie A holders are looking for reinforcements in midfield after Kevin De Bruyne suffered a long-term injury, and according to the latest reports from The Athletic, Mainoo's frustration at his lack of minutes has led him to conclude a January loan could be best for all parties.",
      "“He [Mainoo] is a player and a person I hope the best for,\" Parker added.\"He is a wonderful young lad, and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",
      "Amorim was asked again about Mainoo in his Friday press conference. “You always ask me the same thing. I understand what you are saying,\" he said. \"You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that does not mean I need to put Kobbie (in the team) when I feel I shouldn’t put Kobbie (in the team).”",
      "When asked if AFCON absences could boost the midfielder's chances of action, he added: \"I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s the same question. I don’t know what is going to happen. It depends. If I see in the training it is the best thing, I will put it. That is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has already made his feelings clear on Mason Mount, despite Roy Keane ’s latest assessment of the midfielder in which he branded him a ‘schoolboy’.",
      "The Red Devils have enjoyed something of an upturn in form this season after a dismal campaign last year. However, recent results have been inconsistent - a defeat to Everton last week, followed by a triumph over Crystal Palace at the weekend, and then a disappointing 1-1 draw at home to West Ham midweek.",
      "Amorim’s side initially took the lead in the first half courtesy of a goal from Diogo Dalot. However, they were unable to see out the win and claim all three points as Soungoutou Magassa found the net for the visitors late on to level the scoreline.",
      "Mount started the game on the bench, but came on to replace Joshua Zirkzee with a little over 10 minutes left to play. Soon after, the Hammers found their equaliser and United did not have it in them to claw back the lead in the closing stages.",
      "Keane, who made a little under 500 appearances for the Red Devils during his playing days, issued a scathing assessment of United’s performance post-match, in which he specifically took aim at Mount. Despite scoring the match winner against Palace at the weekend, the 26-year-old was branded a \"schoolboy\" by Keane on this occasion.",
      "\"When you are trying to see a game off, I look at Mason Mount when he came on, some players take longer to get up to speed but he was like a schoolboy out there. You’re looking for players to come on with presence. If anything they brought the levels down at United. That seemed to be the case tonight.\"",
      "It is likely a sentiment Amorim would strongly disagree with, given he has always been quick to praise Mount - even going back to when he first took the reins in November last year. Right from the outset, during his first fortnight at the helm, Mount’s attitude and determination impressed Amorim.",
      "\"Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid,\" the head coach told club media a little over 12 months ago. “You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Even after injuries hindered Mount’s campaign, in which he missed over 20 games with a hamstring problem, Amorim could not wait to have the midfielder back available for selection again. \"I really love Mason Mount,” the United boss told the media prior to the player's return back in March.",
      "\"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club.\"",
      "The praise did not stop there. Even as recently as the weekend, following United’s win over Palace, Mount showed his true colours as he consoled young defender Leny Yoro after a difficult game. The midfielder may have been the hero on that occasion, but his leadership was on full display at the full-time whistle, something that did not go unnoticed by Amorim.",
      "\"For me, as a manager, it’s really important,\" Amorim explained this week. \"But I take it as normal. If you spend so many hours with one guy, if you have a common goal, if you suffer all together.",
      "\"I think we should support each other because, in the end, we have our friends, we have our club but, in the end, we are the guys who can change everything.\"",
      "United return to action this weekend and will hope to get back to winning ways when they take on a struggling Wolves side at Molineux. Then, the run-up to Christmas will be in full swing with tricky tests against Bournemouth and Aston Villa.",

      "For the second time this season, Manchester United got a goal from a wing-back on Thursday night. The manner in which the ball fell to Diogo Dalot was fortunate, but Dalot's finish was not and neither was his positioning.",
      "This was what Amorim so desperately wanted from the wide players in his team. With the ball on the right, left wing-back Dalot moved into a central area inside the penalty box. When Casemiro's deflected shot fell to him, he was ten yards out and had time to take a touch and finish.",
      "The problem for United and Amorim is that it isn't happening enough. The wing-backs in this system are supposed to provide an attacking threat, but they aren't doing it on a regular basis. Amad was lively at times against West Ham, but generally, the quality isn't there out wide.",
      "Dalot continues to give his all and can deliver at times, but the transition to wing-back doesn't come easily and he would probably look a lot more comfortable as a natural full-back with a winger in front of him. Patrick Dorgu is a more attacking wing-back, but he has yet to show he is good enough for this level.",
      "Amorim spoke last week about the anxiety he senses when Dorgu has the ball and the 21-year-old isn't a sufficient attacking threat down the left. The quality is lacking.",
      "During the answer about the anxiety you can feel when Dorgu has the ball, Amorim also expanded on his wing-backs, admitting they weren't good enough at the moment but insisting they were showing more in training.",
      "\"What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games,\" he said.",
      "\"I think they (wing-backs) are far from the best, and they know it. So, like a lot of players in our team, like myself. So I just, I just look at them, and I think they have so much more to give. So let's see, let's see this week if we improve that.\"",
      "He was also asked last month if wing-back was an area he wanted to strengthen, but again said time was needed to \"improve the characteristics of the team.\"",
      "The problem is that Amorim has had a year to turn the wings into a positive area for United and he hasn't done it. It is also surprising that the £25million deal to sign Dorgu in January is the only attempt to strengthen the position in the transfer market, with the £215m summer spending spree focusing on a striker and two No. 10s.",
      "Things might be about to get worse as well. Amad will head to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) later this month, as will Noussair Mazraoui, who is only a very occasional fill-in at wing-back these days. Amad's absence will be felt keenly. He is easily the most attacking wing-back in this squad and the one who looks most likely to provide the incision from out wide.",
      "Unless Amorim decides to move Luke Shaw back out wide, then Dalot and Dorgu will be the only available wing-backs while Amad is away with the Ivory Coast. It's hard not to think that will reduce United's wide threat and put more of an onus on goals and creativity on Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "If this system is to ever click into gear and work on a regular basis, then either the wing-backs have to improve or better players have to be signed for the role.",

      "There have been boos to greet the final whistle at the end of the last two games at Old Trafford and it feels like Bonnie Tyler's 'It’s a Heartache’ hasn't been heard quite as often in Manchester United ends recently, but it would be stretching it to say matchgoers have lost faith in Ruben Amorim just yet.",
      "It's clear concerns at the lack of progress are growing and the momentum built up a month ago has again been replaced by introspection, but United fans are generally reluctant to turn on a manager. They didn't really turn on Erik ten Hag in stadiums and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer only properly got abuse on his final day in charge after a 4-1 defeat at Watford. Amorim hasn't had anything like that yet.",
      "But from his adherence to a system that isn't working to concerns over a playing style that is hardly thrilling to watch, the pubs around the ground will be ablaze with fans who aren't convinced at what they are seeing. The issue that might finally drive a wedge between supporters and Amorim is a player we get barely to see, however. Kobbie Mainoo has managed just 171 minutes in the Premier League this season and as the weeks have gone by, Amorim's faith in him seems to decline.",
      "There is a similar precedent towards the end of Solskjaer's reign, when fans used his refusal to play Donny van de Beek as a stick to beat him with. The difference is that Solskjaer was right and Van de Beek hadn't shown enough for United, and never would do. With Mainoo, the feeling is different.",
      "Fans have already seen what the gifted 20-year-old can do. He burst onto the scene in 2023/24, has played in a major tournament final, scored some brilliant goals for United and been at the heart of an FA Cup final win against Manchester City. But now he is the last option in midfield for Amorim, the break glass in case of emergency player on the bench, and even then, Amorim would rather look elsewhere.",
      "With United needing a goal against West Ham on Thursday, the Portuguese head coach opted for Lisandro Martinez as his fifth and final substitute. It left Mainoo kicking his heels again, but it was clear to everyone else inside Old Trafford that he was the more likely source of a goal.",
      "To compound matters, Mainoo is the Stockport-born United fan who is the current poster boy of an academy being turned into a cash machine rather than a source of first-team footballers. Supporters are baffled at his lack of involvement and angry at Amorim's approach to homegrown players.",
      "It won't have helped matters that Amorim was so dismissive of Mainoo in his press conference ahead of facing Wolves this weekend. He gave the impression there were very few scenarios in which he would play the youngster and was clearly sick of being asked about him.",
      "Mainoo has no option but to pursue a loan move next month. His development is stalling for a lack of first-team football and whatever it is Amorim and his coaches are trying to improve in training, the approach clearly isn't working.",
      "But if Mainoo moves to the continent for six months and starts lighting up games again with his wonderful close control, ability to manipulate the ball near the box and find space in tight situations, the frustration at Amorim's approach to him will only grow.",
      "If United were flying under the 40-year-old, then this would be less of an issue. Supporters would still be frustrated, but they would be willing to trust Amorim and let it slide for now. But they are not flying. They are going nowhere at the moment.",
      "United would have no interest in letting Mainoo leave permanently in January and the midfielder wouldn't want to. He wants to make it at Old Trafford and right now he is probably looking at it and thinking he is far more likely to last the course than Amorim.",
      "The former Sporting boss is under pressure and his refusal to give Mainoo a chance is only raising the stakes. It might be the issue that finally sees patience snap for many fans.",

      "'Best in class' was the buzzword used by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in several interviews during his courtship of Manchester United. Ratcliffe was adamant that only the best would be good enough, from boardroom hires to recruitment, to restore United to former glories. That plan is currently not working.",
      "There were boos at Old Trafford following the final whistle against West Ham, another disappointing result that has led many fans to suggest Ruben Amorim should face the axe. Wolves is a must-win for Amorim and the next few weeks will decide his future. United have an incredibly kind run of fixtures and Amorim should bite the bullet if he cannot string together a run of results.",
      "Amorim was Omar Berrada's appointment. Jason Wilcox has been the driving force behind recruitment since Ratcliffe's investment. It would reflect badly on United's chiefs if they do decide to sack Amorim. Berrada and Wilcox were supposedly 'best in class' hires, but they will be sweating if Amorim is kicked out of the classroom because the headteacher will demand answers from his staff.",
      "Sacking Amorim would cost around £10million. That would be a major waste of cash, without mentioning that United paid £9.2m to buy Amorim out of his Sporting Lisbon contract. If Amorim departed, Ratcliffe would be frustrated at the time United have wasted. He is a man in a hurry and wants to win the league by 2028, in line with the club's 150th anniversary, so sacking Amorim would set the Ineos project back, but there is no point in staying on a train heading in the wrong direction.",
      "After the Manchester derby defeat, Wilcox spoke at an event at Old Trafford for ex-players and it was illuminating to hear him speak about his challenging start to working at United. YouTube channel Man Utd The Religion recorded the interview.",
      "“It has been a rollercoaster,\" said Wilcox. \"I came in last April, around 18 months ago, and it’s been a real challenge, I can’t lie. I thought the club was in a much better place than it was. We had no football identity, we lacked alignment between ownership, the CEO, football and the academy.",
      "“And we’ve just been working so hard behind the scenes. There’s been a lot of work that’s gone on to change the staff. I know in the media, there's an awful lot of coverage around the redundancies.",
      "“But the football club needed to go through a period of transformation, without a doubt. Forget the redundancies. The whole structure of Manchester United needed to change… I would have done it from a sporting side. I did the same at Southampton, at Man City.",
      "\"It's important we have a leaner workforce that provides accountability and responsibility for people. It's really sad to see people lose their jobs, but it needed to be done.\"",
      "He continued: \"Now we’ve got a platform to rebuild. I didn't realise how big this club was, even though I've competed against this club as a player and as a coach. This club is a wonderful club.",
      "“I just pray we get the opportunity to turn it around. I really feel it's not 'will we win again', I think it's 'when will we win again'. It's going to take time and it's not a quick fix, especially now with the regulations.",
      "\"We needed to change the playing squad. We've made some really good additions this summer. Sometimes taking players out of the squad is as important as the players you bring in.",
      "\"We have to bring back the culture and respect back to Man United, whether you work for us, or play against us, you feel like you're part of something special. I'm extremely proud, I'm extremely privileged, but I am extremely frustrated as well because we can't fix it quickly enough.\"",
      "The positions of Wilcox and Berrada should not be immune from scrutiny in this mess.",

      "There were no caveats presented when Sir Jim Ratcliffe stated in October that he wanted Ruben Amorim to have three years to prove himself at Manchester United. The statement didn't come with a list of terms and conditions.",
      "Everything Ratcliffe has said has pointed to his desire to give Amorim time. United have been through a succession of managers in recent years and none of them have managed to bring consistent success back to Old Trafford. In Ratcliffe's view, the issues are as much structural as having the wrong man in the dugout.",
      "But there will surely come a time when Amorim's position comes under intense scrutiny once again. Perhaps we're there after desperately disappointing results in the last two home fixtures. Monday's trip to Wolves sticks out as a banana skin fraught with danger.",
      "Lose to a team who have just two points from 14 Premier League games and the damage will be difficult to recover from. A win should be a given, but it might only be a matter of time until the next result that puts the Portuguese head coach back in the spotlight.",
      "All eyes at Old Trafford will be on the league table. Amorim's side are eighth at the moment, only two points off fourth but equally only three points off 14th. They need to be moving in the right direction.",
      "United can spin the positives of one season out of Europe, which includes extra time on the training pitch for Amorim and a group of fresh players to target the Premier League every weekend. But right now, they are not making the most of those advantages.",
      "A second campaign outside of the Champions League and the riches on offer in the expanded competition would be damaging. A second season outside of Europe would be disastrous entirely.",
      "The difference between the Europa League and the Champions League is north of £100 million and missing out on that kind of cash is going to hurt. It will limit what United can do in the transfer market, damage their ability to attract players and impact revenues at a time when building a new stadium is a top priority.",
      "We can't be sure how much that will come into Ratcliffe's thinking. As a businessman, he will clearly have an eye on the bottom line, but could he be willing to suck up the pain for another season in the interest of standing by his man? It would be a brave call.",
      "However, one area of potential conflict is with the Glazer family, who remain the majority shareholders, even though it's Ratcliffe who is currently running the show. The Glazers are all about the finances and they know how expensive not getting in the Champions League is.",
      "They have been ruthless with managers before when Europe has slipped away, often dismissing them when qualification for the Champions League became impossible. United's long-term ambitions can only be met with consistent entry into the Champions League.",
      "The Premier League is likely to have a fifth spot again next season, giving United more room to bag themselves a seat at the top table. An encouraging run of fixtures in December might yet see them put themselves firmly into that race.",
      "If that doesn't happen, however, and the gap grows, that is when things could get nervy for Amorim. It is also when Ratcliffe's desire to give him time and the Glazers' focus on revenue could potentially rub up against each other.",
      "For now, the Glazers are letting Ratcliffe and his team get on with running United. But you guarantee they are keeping a close eye on events at the club and they will be well aware of the consequences of missing out on the Champions League again.",

      "Press conferences with Ruben Amorim have rarely been short of insight in his time as Manchester United head coach. He is unflinchingly honest, too much so at times, and has often revealed more of himself and his team than some at Carrington would want.",
      "But for the first time on Thursday night, he also looked like someone feeling the pressure. He held his press conference to digest a disappointing draw with West Ham and then went straight into the preview for the game against Wolves, and Amorim's mood was as dark as the Mancunian night.",
      "The United head coach was confrontational when asked about his substitutes against the Hammers, but it got worse when thoughts turned to Wolves. He was pressed on Kobbie Mainoo's lack of action and became defensive. Having let out a laugh when it was suggested Mainoo was an attacking option he could have used off the bench against West Ham, he offered no sign of an olive branch after that.",
      "It was clear the questions on Mainoo were getting to Amorim. \"My job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing,\" he said when asked if he understood the interest in the player.",
      "When it was put to him that he didn't trust the academy, he shot back with a 'why?' and went defensive on his record of promoting young players and explaining why he hadn't given Shea Lacey a debut, having put the teenager on the bench for the last three games.",
      "Amorim had said he was \"frustrated and angry\" at the West Ham result and that much was clear to see. His press conference wasn't helping his mood.",
      "He had said \"I don't know\" on at least three occasions during his responses to questions about Mainoo, which probably summed up how uncomfortable he is talking about the subject more than anything else.",
      "But when it was put to him that he had used that phrase several times later on, he demanded to know when and an awkward moment only ended when the subject was closed by Amorim's press officer, who moved the press conference on.",
      "The only other time Amorim appeared to say \"I don't know\" was when it was put to him that the players had a mental blockage about moving into the top five, having failed to take that opportunity on a couple of occasions now. He did go on to try and explain why.",
      "It's no surprise Amorim doesn't have all the answers, but his Old Trafford reign is back in the spotlight. A month that should have been an opportunity has started badly and Monday's trip to Wolves is a banana skin that really could signal the end if it goes badly.",
      "That might be why Amorim is showing signs of feeling the pressure. He has occasionally shown an edgy side in media dealings and was surprised when he arrived in England at the number of obligations he had to fulfil. Although he tries not to speak to his players after disappointing results, his own frustration can linger.",
      "But Thursday night was the spikiest and most volatile he has been so far. He needs a result on Monday to ease the pressure valve.",

      "Manuel Ugarte should have had a head start on his Manchester United teammates when Ruben Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024. After all, Ugarte played 85 games under Amorim at Sporting.",
      "His form was good enough in Lisbon to earn a move to Paris Saint-Germain and although his stay in the French capital lasted only one season, he was signed by United in the summer of 2024.",
      "Erik ten Hag wasn't entirely convinced the Uruguayan was the right man, but spoke warmly of him after his arrival for £50million. A relatively slow start to life at United was supposed to gain momentum under Amorim.",
      "That isn't how it has played out. He has started just 21 of Amorim's 41 Premier League games in charge and none since defeat to Brentford at the end of September. There have been just 77 minutes in eight league matches since then and he has been an unused substitute for three of the last five games.",
      "These are damning statistics for a £50million midfielder who had a prior relationship with his head coach. Given Amorim has a plug-and-play system that he used at Sporting, Ugarte should have picked it up quicker than any of his teammates. Instead, he has drifted to the fringes of the team.",
      "Amorim accepted a couple of weeks ago that Ugarte was finding it difficult at the moment, but insisted he wanted to help the 24-year-old come out the other side of it.",
      "\"You can sense a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" he said. \"He is struggling at the moment but it is our job to try to help and help him to feel like I felt when he was a Sporting player.",
      "\"But it is a different world. He needs to adapt, and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "Amorim told Ugarte he wasn't at the level he showed at Sporting in a team meeting after the Europa League final defeat and the evidence continues to mount that he might not get back there.",
      "He is probably the most defensive midfielder in this squad, given Casemiro's penchant for getting forward and into the opposition box, but he isn't making the team look any more secure when he plays.",
      "Part of the reason for his introduction 13 minutes from time against West Ham on Thursday was to see out a 1-0 lead, but United conceded. That might not have been directly down to Ugarte, but the case against him is mounting.",
      "United have conceded 14 of their 23 goals this season when Ugarte has been on the pitch and that isn't a great reflection of his ability to offer protection to his defence.",
      "It looks increasingly likely that a United midfielder will leave on loan in January, with Kobbie Mainoo playing even less than Ugarte. The 20-year-old has managed just 171 minutes in the Premier League and hasn't started in that competition this season. It seems Amorim has no faith in him.",
      "Ugarte is faring only marginally better. There has to be a question as to his long-term future at Old Trafford and if a midfielder is to leave the club next month, there is an argument it should be Ugarte rather than Mainoo.",

      "Despite any existing friction between Manchester United and Marcus Rashford, the Premier League heavyweights clearly hold their player in high regard. Rashford has experienced a resurgence while on loan at Barcelona this season and could make his move to the Spanish giants permanent in the summer.",
      "However, United have made a bold move by bestowing a new title upon the player mid-season. This could potentially stir up controversy among some supporters given his standing with the club at the time of his departure.",
      "In other news, United have been dealt a blow with the news that another academy graduate could be facing a stint on the sidelines due to a \"quite serious\" injury. The MEN delves into all the latest happenings at Old Trafford ahead of Monday's trip to Wolverhampton.",
      "There was a point when Rashford seemed a cert for legendary status at Old Trafford after he first broke into the first team in early 2016. Much has happened over the past decade, and his bond with the club seemed to break when he first went on loan to Aston Villa nearly a year ago.",
      "The relationship became even more complex when his loan to Barca, complete with an affordable purchase option, was confirmed in the summer. However, United have demonstrated their spirit by listing Rashford under the 'Legends' section on their official website.",
      "The 28-year-old enters elite territory, joining the ranks of Sir Bobby Charlton, Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Wayne Rooney and Denis Irwin in that exclusive group. The move reflects how United view the player, regardless of recent events.",
      "It had been claimed Rashford's rapport with manager Ruben Amorim deteriorated at some stage as his fortunes in England declined. Yet while he may not currently be performing at his peak for United, it evidently hasn't overshadowed his considerable achievements while wearing the famous red.",
      "Before departing on loan, Rashford contributed to the club winning two FA Cups, a Europa League trophy and two League Cups. Whilst others in the Legends category may have triumphed during more successful periods, Rashford is still acknowledged for playing a crucial role in keeping the club competitive during the post-Sir Alex Ferguson years.",
      "It may not be the Camp Nou, but United youngster Toby Collyer had demonstrated genuine potential on loan at the Hawthorns this campaign. The 21-year-old moved to West Brom during the summer, with the intention of accumulating vital game time before returning to Old Trafford next season.",
      "Unfortunately, Collyer has made his way back to Manchester earlier than anticipated following an injury Baggies manager Ryan Mason described as \"quite a big\" one. This now casts doubt over his remaining time with the Championship outfit.",
      "\"It's quite a big injury,\" Mason told BBC Radio WM. \"He's at United at the minute where they're assessing him and then in the coming weeks we'll decide his plan regarding his rehab.",
      "\"We've got him on loan for the season and normally any loan player that gets an injury that's a bit more than a small one, more a significant one, it's only right for the parent club to look at them, check them over, and we're in dialogue and hopefully he can do his rehab and come back better.\"",
      "Collyer has featured 13 times for United's senior side and was regarded as someone with the capability to secure a position under Amorim's management. He's made 12 appearances for West Brom thus far and had a short stint in the starting XI back in October.",

      "Ruben Amorim dismissed claims he had no faith in the Manchester United academy but refused to offer Kobbie Mainoo any guarantees that he would get a chance when the club lose players to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute during United's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday despite being one of only two attacking options on the bench. He has managed just 171 minutes of Premier League football this season and his only start came in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old will return to the scene of one of his best moments in a United shirt on Monday night. Mainoo scored a stunning winning goal at Molineux in February 2024, during a remarkable breakout season that ended with him playing in a European Championship final.",
      "However, he has fallen out of favour under Amorim and doesn't look like forcing his way into the team anytime soon. Manuel Ugarte came on for Joshua Zirkzee against the Hammers and quizzed about Mainoo's prospects before the trip to Wolves, Amorim became frustrated at the topic coming up again.",
      "“Of course I understand [why you ask], and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing,\" he said.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.”",
      "Amorim accepted that Mainoo's situation was becoming deflating for the academy graduate, who could leave on loan during the January transfer window.",
      "But he insisted his team selection was purely down to picking the best players and that he didn't see Mainoo in the best XI this season.",
      "“I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch,\" he said.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "Asked if AFCON could be Mainoo's route into the team, Amorim added: \"I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Amorim's faith in the academy has been questioned recently. He has shunted Mainoo to the margins of the squad and although youngsters such as Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey have made the bench this season, they haven't made it onto the pitch.",
      "It was put to Amorim that he didn't trust the academy, and he went on to explain why Lacey has made the bench for three games in a row but not made an appearance.",
      "\"“But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard,\" he said.",
      "“So you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.”",

      "It was all too painfully familiar for Manchester United fans on Thursday night as they watched their side draw against West Ham at Old Trafford. The Reds managed to get a goal from Diogo Dalot to give them the lead but they were unable to push on.",
      "Instead of looking to kill off the game, United retreated to their more comfortable position of consolidation. Ruben Amorim's decisions saw him bring on mainly defensive players and ultimately the Reds were punished as they succumbed to a late equaliser.",
      "After the match, Amorim was questioned on his substitutions in the second half. He replied: \"No [I don't regret the substitutions], we are losing because of the second ball. Sometimes there's not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?",
      "\"It was the second ball. I was worried with Matheus [Cunha]. I know that Bruno [Fernandes] has reached the box really well. Mason Mount is playing in his position. They were trying to push us. Bryan [Mbeumo] has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one position. So that was my idea.\"",
      "Whether Amorim would have done the same if he had more options available to him is unknown. The truth is the Portuguese head coach did not have the attacking options on the bench needed to change a game.",
      "Shea Lacey and Mount were the only two players on the bench who could be defined as attackers but while the latter did come on and could do a similar job in attacking midfield to those who started, neither man can do the centre-forward role which Joshua Zirkzee is currently performing. Right now, once the Dutchman leaves the field, United's striker options are exhausted.",
      "That is why Amorim should consider recalling a player back to the first-team squad who he would rather not see return just yet - Chido Obi. The youngster made eight senior appearances for United last season out of necessity and did impress at times considering his age.",
      "However, the 18-year-old has been kept in the academy this season as he continues his development. Obi is currently out with an injury but upon his return to full fitness, United need to look at recalling him.",
      "The Dane would offer United another attacking option on the bench while Benjamin Sesko is out and while it is not ideal to be relying on him, beggars cannot be choosers. Obi is not a player who Amorim would like to recall to the first-team this season, not because he doesn't rate the teenager but due to him not wanting to rush Obi back into senior football.",
      "Amorim said recently: \"I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team. That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that.",
      "\"The perfect conditions. We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon.",
      "\"And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "Amorim has said it himself there, Obi needs to be in the squad on a necessity basis only. The truth is, it is now a necessity for him to be in the squad - the West Ham game proved as much.",
      "There was no way United could alter their plans once they took the likes of Zirkzee and Cunha departed. Once they were off the pitch, the Reds had to hope their defensive gameplan would work - it didn't.",
      "Once he is fit again, Obi should be on that bench and offering United and Amorim another attacking option which they desperately need.",

      "Ruben Amorim channelled his inner Gennaro Gattuso when discussing why Manchester United have been unable to take advantage of a couple of opportunities recently to move into the top five in the Premier League, only he did so without the expletive the Italian memorably opted for.",
      "\"Sometimes we play good, sometimes we play bad,\" said Amorim, matter-of-factly and truthfully. It wasn't far from Gattuso's \"sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe...\", well, you get the gist now. It has since been turned into an iconic and widely used meme.",
      "It's unlikely Amorim's blunt dissection of United's form will get the meme treatment, but it's a worryingly accurate representation of the team he is in charge of. The reason United aren't fifth is that they play poorly as often as they play well.",
      "That much is clear in the failure to put any kind of consistent run together in his nearly 13 months in charge of the club. Three-game winning runs in January and October remain the gold standard.",
      "United have had presentable chances to get themselves higher than eighth in this table, but every time they seem to take a step forward, they just as quickly regress.",
      "They were five unbeaten when they conspired to lose at home against 10-man Everton. They had just won at Crystal Palace, becoming the first team to beat them at Selhurst Park in the Premier League since February, when they turned in a dire performance against West Ham.",
      "That kind of inconsistency is clearly beginning to infuriate Amorim, who found it especially difficult to hide his emotions after the game on Thursday night. He knows this kind of form is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.",
      "It's ingraining an idea that his reign is going nowhere, or in a more generous interpretation, isn't going anywhere fast enough. He is more than a year in now, but still results and performances like those against Everton and West Ham are too common.",
      "That is something Amorim really needs to stamp out. In a low-scoring sport susceptible to moments of fortune, results will always come and go to a degree. You can only stack the odds in your favour by delivering performances, but too many of United's recent performances offer no hint of a brighter future.",
      "That needs to change. They head to Molineux on Monday to face a Wolves side who are flirting with the possibility of being the Premier League's worst ever and only a win will do. But as much as they need the three points, they also need a convincing display.",
      "After that is an out-of-form Bournemouth team. A trip to Aston Villa is laced with difficulty but home games against Newcastle and Wolves offer the possibility of a strong finish to the year.",
      "The problem is that it's proving impossible to predict United's performance levels, and therefore their results. They should win all three home games against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Wolves, but many Old Trafford regulars will be raising eyebrows at that statement and expecting a draw or defeat somewhere in there.",
      "Amorim's blunt analysis was spot on. United are sometimes good, and they are sometimes bad. But that isn't good enough.",

      "A left-footed midfielder, there are high hopes for Jacey at the United academy and he has been involved in the England Under-15 set-up, but Saturday was the first time he had a place in the squad for Darren Fletcher's Under-18 set-up at United.",
      "Jacey played with Kai Rooney for United's Under-16s in the SuperCupNI during the summer, a prestigious youth tournament in Northern Ireland, and his progress has continued this season. He has won national titles at Under-14 and Under-15 level, playing a key role in both of those triumphs.",
      "He came on against Newcastle with 20 minutes remaining, replacing in-form 15-year-old striker JJ Gabriel, although for once it wasn't the Barcelona target who got the goals for Fletcher's team.",
      "With the game goalless at the break, 15-year-old attacker Douka Nkoto came and produced a dazzling display, scoring twice to bag his first goal at Under-18 level.",
      "He bagged his first from close range after Godwill Kukonki did well in the build-up. The centre-back had a role in Nkoto's second as well, with another finish from in front of goal doubling the lead.",

      "The United icon slammed the treatment of the 20-year-old academy graduate after recent transfer business at Old Trafford has seen the likes of Scott McTominay go from strength-to-strength in Serie A with Napoli. Mainoo was an unused substitute for the draw with West Ham United on Thursday.",

      "The scenes during Euro 2022 will live long in the memory. The nation was gripped with Lioness fever as England made history by beating Germany to lift the trophy at a sold-out Wembley Stadium. But the legacy of that tournament – which saw 16 nations battle it out across a total of 31 games in 10 venues from Wembley to Rotherham – has been huge for the women’s game.",
      "Close to 575,000 fans watched the matches live, many of them attending a women’s football match for the first time, while more than 365 million people tuned in on TV from 195 countries. The sport boomed on social media as fans found their new heroes, while money began pouring into the sport.",
      "In the past three years since that tournament, the game has just continued to grow in terms of awareness, investment, publicity and interest. So the news that the UK is so far the only nation in the running to host the 2035 World Cup is something everyone associated with the sport should be excited and delighted about – and the December edition of the Mirror's Women's Football News is certainly that.",
      "If it is confirmed when the final decision on the hosts is made in April that football is coming home, it will see 48 teams competing in what will be a truly stunning festival of football. A list of 22 venues across all four nations have been put forward by the UK bidding team including the new Old Trafford, Wembley, Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, Glasgow’s Hampden Park, Belfast’s Windsor Park and Newcastle’s St James’ Park. And although that list will be whittled down once the decision on the host nation is confirmed, by the size of the stadiums put forward, organisers are expecting big crowds.",

      "Despite picking up a very good victory over Crystal Palace, there was a sense of trepidation ahead of Manchester United's clash with West Ham on Thursday evening. Last time United were under the lights at Old Trafford, they came unstuck as ten man Everton picked up a deserved victory.",
      "In the second half of that fixture, United had plenty of the ball but offered very little attacking threat. Joshua Zirkzee struggled to lead the line while build-up play, particularly down the left, often broke down. There were simply no solutions to turn to on the United bench, either.",
      "This is why what happened against West Ham was not a shock. On this occasion, United managed to score the opening goal through Diogo Dalot but instead of pushing for a second and killing off the game, the Reds made changes to consolidate their advantage. Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Lisandro Martinez were all brought on, the latter after the Reds had conceded.",
      "The only attack-minded substitution was Mason Mount. who replaced Zirkzee. The Dutchman has had his critics but at least he was offering good link-up play and having left the pitch, United were ill-prepared to refocus on attacking if West Ham found an equaliser, which they managed from a corner.",
      "After the game, Ruben Amorim was quizzed about his substitutions. He initially said his plan was to win more second balls after making the substitutions, but it was telling that Amorim also asked this question in reply: \"We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?\"",
      "This statement could be perceived as a message to the United boardroom. As he continues to overlook Kobbie Mainoo, who is more attack-minded than Ugarte but still obviously not an out-and-out attacking player, there were very few options Amorim would be willing to turn to.",
      "Since the international break, United have played three matches without Benjamin Sesko. In those matches, United have had a maximum of two players who are offensively-minded on the bench - during the Crystal Palace game it was just Shea Lacey.",
      "But the new norm at the minute is Mount and Lacey on the bench. Amorim simply does not have the options available to him to make attacking changes - even if he wanted to. Would throwing Lacey into the game on Thursday night have been helpful for the Reds? Probably not.",
      "He is a young player who has a bright future but he needs to be eased in to senior football. Lacey shouldn't be thrust into a game like that with an expectation to come up with a goal to kill the game off - not at this stage of his development, anyway.",
      "Amorim has uncovered a major priority heading into the January transfer window. If United pick up any more injuries or absence in their forward line, they will be even more stretched. Adding reinforcements to the squad - particularly a centre-forward - should be at the top of the manager's wishlist heading into 2026.",
      "There should be genuine concerns ahead of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad leaving for AFCON soon. Should Sesko be deemed unfit to return when Mbeumo and Amad leave, who does Amorim turn to then? Until this issue is addressed, United can expect to find goals difficult to come by.",

      "Manchester United loanee Toby Collyer has suffered \"quite a big injury\" on loan at West Brom. Collyer has returned to Carrington to be assessed, but West Brom are hopeful he can contribute to their promotion push in the second half of the season. Collyer received permanent and loan interest from over a dozen clubs in the Championship during the summer transfer window, but West Brom won the race for his signature.",
      "The youngster's loan at the Hawthorns hasn't gone to plan, though. Collyer picked up a muscle injury in October, which kept him out for four games, and suffered a more serious issue after his return. Collyer was absent from the West Brom squad last weekend. Their manager, Ryan Mason, spoke to the Express & Star on Thursday and confirmed he has returned to Carrington to be assessed.",
      "Mason explained: “It’s quite a big injury. He’s at United at the minute. They’re just assessing him, and then I think in the coming weeks we’ll just decide his plan regarding his rehab.”",
      "When asked if the injury could impact Collyer's loan, Mason said: \"We’ve got him on loan for the season. That’s the plan. Normally, any loan player who gets an injury that’s a bit more than a small one, more of a significant one, I think it’s right for the parent club to look at them to check them over.",
      "\"We’re in dialogue and hopefully he can do his rehab and come back better. We’re looking into it, both clubs. He’s disappointed, naturally. When you’re trying to build your career when you have setbacks that hold you back, it’s challenging. But I guess the reality is to get to the top in any industry there’s going to be challenges. I think if he’s clever, if he uses it wisely, then for sure it can make him stronger in many different aspects.\"",
      "Collyer made 13 first-team appearances in a breakthrough 2024/2025 season at Old Trafford. Last year, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",
      "Collyer's contract at United runs until the summer of 2027, with the option of another year.",

      "With West Ham level in the 83rd minute, the United head coach then took off Luke Shaw for Lisandro Martinez and left Kobbie Mainoo on the bench, despite his team needing a winner. But Amorim said he had made the changes because his team were losing too many second balls and he felt they still had the firepower to score goals.",
      "\"No,\" he said when asked if he would change the replacements. \"We are losing because of the second ball. Sometimes there's not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?",
      "\"It was the second ball. I was worried with Matheus. I know that Bruno has reached the box really well. Mason Mount is playing in his position. They were trying to push us. Bryan has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one position. So that was my idea.\"",
      "Asked how he felt after seeing his side concede a late equaliser that cost them a chance of going fifth in the Premier League, he said he was \"frustrated and angry\", but then rejected claims his team were failing to progress.",

      "Manchester United are facing a difficult decision over the future of Kobbie Mainoo, as their England midfielder angles towards a potential during the January transfer window.",
      "The academy graduate has struggled for minutes under Ruben Amorim, who has preferred a double pivot with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro - particularly this season.",
      "Mainoo has played just 261 minutes so far this term, making just one start, which came in the Carabao Cup. He hasn't had much tome off the bench in the Premier League, either.",
      "That has seen the 20-year-old fall out of favour in the England system, too, with his last appearance coming in September 2024, which comes as quite a blow, considering it is a World Cup season.",
      "With opportunities seeming hard to come by, it seems as though Mainoo is willing to take things into his own hands, as The Athletic report that the midfielder is ready to seek a loan move away from United in the January transfer window, owing to his frustration over game-time",
      "The report also indicates no final decision has been made by the club, who aren't expected to make one until after AFCON, which is in the middle of the market, due to the potential impact of players leaving during the competition.",
      "It puts a timeline on when the academy star could leave, if United decide that the best course of action is an exit during the coming weeks.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in his side's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday night, with further questions arising over his future at the club.",
      "\"I see it [frustration]. I just want to win,\" Amorim said before Monday's clash against Wolves when asked whether Mainoo may be demoralised by his decisions. \"I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games,\" the Portuguese went on. \"One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "While Amorim has defended his stance on Mainoo, United legend Paul Scholes is less forgiving with the manager after recent comments he made.",
      "Scholes took to Instagram and said: \"Bulls***. The kid's being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether Mainoo will be allowed to depart and progress elsewhere - from January onwards - with some big calls still to make. However, with links continuing around United, and a midfield transfer in over the near future, everything points towards a possible exit for Mainoo.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "A passionate seven-year-old Manchester United fan whose celebration of a Bruno Fernandes penalty went viral - and caught the attention of the club captain - shed tears after walking the teams out with his hero at Old Trafford.",
      "Bobby Moore was United's mascot for the derby day draw with Manchester City earlier this month, leading the players out alongside Fernandes and becoming the first club mascot to use a powerchair or wheelchair.",
      "Bobby's celebration of a United penalty in his signature red powerchair went viral on social media and was seen by Fernandes, who then received a letter from the Belfast youngster as part of the Premier League's Fan Mail series. Two days before the clash with City, Bobby was invited to Carrington to take part in a powerchair football session before being surprised by Fernandes.",
      "Bobby, dad Terence, and mum Clare were at Carrington waiting for the event when Fernandes appeared after finishing training ahead of the derby.",
      "\"He came out to see Bobby. He invited him up to the restaurant to have lunch with the players. He got to meet all the players and have a bit of lunch with them,\" said Terence.",
      "\"Then Bruno took him outside to do a bit of powerchair football with the United powerchair team. He was brilliant, to be honest, you didn't feel like he was rushing and it felt like he wanted to be there. He seemed just a genuine guy.\"",
      "It was just during his chat with Fernandes that Bobby's weekend got even better. While his parents knew he was going to be a mascot, something Terence said Fernandes had \"greased the wheels\" on, the youngster only found out he would even be going to the game two days beforehand.",
      "\"A couple of players had kept asking if he was going to the match on Sunday, and Bobby would say, 'No we're not going'. And then Bruno is talking away and asking, ‘Will you go to the match on Sunday?’ And Bobby says, ‘No, I just came here.’",
      "\"Bruno was like, ‘Who told you that?' He says, ‘No, you're going and you're going to lead the team out with me’. It was just a really emotional day and it was amazing. I just couldn't believe it. I knew it was happening, but just seeing the reaction was amazing.\"",
      "With the Saturday to themselves, the family headed to the Trafford Centre for food and a visit to the Sea Life aquarium, but Bobby only wanted the day to pass as quickly as possible before the match on Sunday.",
      "When he got to Old Trafford for the first time, the size of the occasion started to sink in for the United-mad youngster.",
      "\"He was in his element on matchday, so excited in the morning telling us what was happening, but he was just a bit quieter when he realised how big the stadium was and that he was going to be walking out there with the team,\" said Terence.",
      "\"He had said he was going to shout ‘Bruno, Bruno’ into the camera, but then he decided he wasn’t going to do that. He kept making things up that he was going to do. I said just go out there and smile, it’s an amazing experience that you’ll never have again.",
      "\"He was a bit nervous leading up to it, but when we were down in the tunnel with the rest of the mascots, he started talking to a couple of the other mascots, and he sort of felt a bit more at ease, like they were talking away to him.",
      "\"And then when the players came out, a couple of players signed autographs when they were coming out to do their pre-match warm-up. And then Bruno, too, he put him at ease.\"",
      "\"They focus on Kevin De Bruyne and his last derby as the teams come out, and then it pans down to Bobby and Bruno and they gave a bit of detail about Bobby being the first powerchair user to be mascot at Old Trafford. They even named him, we weren’t expecting that,\" said Terence.",
      "\"My phone just blew up. We had only told close family, then I messaged friends to watch from the start on the morning, telling them we were sat behind the net and they would be able to see us. Pretty much Bobby’s whole school was watching. It was just a proud, proud moment, for me and my partner.\"",
      "Fernandes is Terence and Bobby's favourite player, but all of the squad helped put Bobby at ease and make his weekend special, with Terence referencing Rasmus Hojlund as one who went out of his way to chat at Carrington on the Friday.",
      "After the game, Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Mason Mount saw Bobby in the tunnel and went over to chat to him about the game, before one final farewell with Fernandes before it was time to leave.",
      "\"He got a bit emotional on the way out of the stadium,\" said Terence, \"because he was saying that he'll not get to see Bruno again.\"",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Chelsea) – £45m",
      "5th (Everton) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Crystal Palace) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Sunderland) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Liverpool) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Spurs) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Brighton) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Newcastle) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Manchester United) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Bournemouth) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Brentford) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Fulham) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Leeds) – £13.3m",

      "19th (Burnley) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",
      "MORE ON PREMIER LEAGUE SPENDING FROM F365\n👉 Premier League net spend table over the last five years\n👉 The biggest spender in every Premier League season – and how they fared",
      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (21 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £18.5m in 2024/25",
      "3rd) Nottingham Forest (20 games) – worth around £17.7m",
      "=4th) Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle (19 games) – worth around £16.9m",
      "=8th) Manchester City and Spurs (18 games) – worth around £16.1m",
      "10th) Leeds (16 games) – worth around £14.3m",

      "20th) Burnley (9 games) – worth around £8.5m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Arne Slot once rejected an offer from Leeds but would they repay the ‘compliment’ if the tables were turned and the Liverpool manager became available?",
      "Manchester City applied the pressure on Arsenal in a reinvigorated title race, while Everton are making a quiet push for the Champions League.",
      "Spurs failing to beat Brentford might have been terminal for Thomas Frank, but his ex helped finally spark something in the relationship he left them for.",
      "A 3-1 thumping at the hands of Leeds has once again poured cold water on any Chelsea hope of a title bid in the near future.",
      "Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick.",

      "“I don’t care about that. I just try to put the best players on the pitch. You have (Manuel) Ugarte that played two games – one of them, Case (Casemiro) was out. Bruno (Fernandes) is always fit. He’s the guy that is doing his (Mainoo’s) position so maybe it has to do with that.”",

A high level meeting is on the horizon, where they’ll need to resolve their differences and decide the future direction of the club. It’s a critical moment for Manchester United, and the pressure is mounting from the fans.’",

      "Parker told MyBettingSites: “I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake. He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup. He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.”",
      "“It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at McTominay. I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out. It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.”",
      "“He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is prepared to look for a loan move away from Old Trafford in January as he seeks regular minutes, according to reports.",
      "The England international has not started in the Premier League for Man Utd this term with Ruben Amorim preferring other players in midfield.",
      "Mainoo, who has been linked with a loan move to Napoli, has made nine appearances off the substitutes’ bench but his only start in all competitions came as Man Utd were knocked out of the League Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town earlier this year.",
      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "However, Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox managed to persuade Mainoo to fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",
      "There has been no progress on him getting minutes under Amorim and now The Athletic insists that Mainoo is ‘ready to seek a loan move away from Manchester United in January after becoming deeply frustrated about his lack of minutes’.",
      "READ: Man Utd fans left incensed by ‘muppet’ Amorim: ‘Get rid before he sells Mainoo’",
      "After being an unused subsitute in their 1-1 draw against West Ham on Thursday night, Mainoo seems to have made up his mind but The Athletic adds: ‘United are, however, expected to wait until after the African Cup of Nations finishes in the middle of the winter window to make a decision on Mainoo, given the uncertainty of how the tournament will impact Cameroon’s Bryan Mbeumo and the Ivory Coast’s Amad.’",
      "When asked on Thursday if he could understand why Mainoo’s lack of football was a talking point, Amorim replied: “Of course I understand. My job is to answer but I am trying to answer always the same thing. And you ask me always the same thing.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England, but that doesn’t mean I need to put Kobbie (on) when I feel I shouldn’t put Kobbie (on).”",
      "Amorim added: “I see it and I just want to win. I just put the players. I don’t look who it is, I don’t care about that, I just try to put the best players on the pitch.",
      "“You have (Manuel) Ugarte that played two games, one of them, (Casemiro) was out. Bruno (Fernandes) is always fit, he’s the guy that is doing (Mainoo’s) position so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "When asked if Mainoo’s prospects of getting into the starting XI would be improved when players depart for the Africa Cup of Nations later this month, Amorim said: “I don’t know. It’s the same question. I don’t know what is going to happen. It depends.",
      "“If I see in the training it is the best thing, I will put (him in). That is the only way I know how to respond to that.”",
      "Shea Lacey has been in Amorim’s last three squads but not come off the bench and when put to him whether he trusts the Man Utd academy players, Amorim continued: “Why? (I don’t pick) any players? We have (only) Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“When Bryan (Mbeumo) is not there, I put Amad because I have other wing backs to play and sometimes it’s hard. You are asking me why don’t I put Lacey to play when I have other guys that are international and they are also on the bench.",
      "“I try to put the best prepared guys for this moment of the club and try to win a game, that is the only thing guys.”",

      "Sources in Greece indicate that Olympiacos are resigned to losing their academy product within the next 18 months. And while the club have no desire to sell their prized asset mid-season, they are bracing themselves for formal approaches as early as the January transfer window for a player who first flagged up for United by former sporting director Dan Ashworth.",

He added: “Yes, it was the second ball and I was worried with Matheus, I know Bruno [Fernandes] reached the box really well, Mason Mount is playing in his position, they were trying to push us, Bryan [Mbeumo] has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one transition, so that was my idea.’",

      "Gary Neville, meanwhile, was left baffled by Man Utd’s performance against West Ham as he explained what he didn’t understand about the display.",
      "“Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he’s not going back into the changing room saying ‘guys, play slowly tonight’. He’s saying ‘let’s get the ball moving quicker, let’s run forward, let’s play with real threat and vigour’.",
      "“It doesn’t transpire out on the pitch, so I don’t know, why does that happen? I’ve got no understanding.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firmed up again. Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper. But then came another clean sheet against Burnley.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (77.8%).",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. Remarkably, conceding four against Aston Villa was bang on the PSxG for that game.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheet v Bournemouth was more like it.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive. Back to being solid at Palace and it wasn’t his fault v West Ham.",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up. Conceding three goals was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet v Wolves was very, very welcome.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1. He was rather more tested v Brentford.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched. Conceded four goals v Fulham and now looks a little lost.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have lost one in eight. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five v Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",

      "Good to see Chelsea bought down to earth by Leeds. Chelsea seemed sterile without Caicedo but that takes nothing away from the good performance by Leeds. They are looking good and put in a good account of themselves against City.",
      "Now Aston Villa away. Why, after feeling relieved to get games against certain title challengers off the list, we come up against a new contender in good form. All this talk about Arsenal being dead certs for the title is wrong. If that was the case, with a record so far of ten wins, three draws and only one defeat, Arsenal would be further ahead than they currently are.\nChris, Croydon",
      "",
      "Why is it that when the league is bunched up, or when teams outside the traditional “big 6/7” (or whatever we’re calling them now) do well, people suggest the league is weak? Monty in the mailbox falls foul of this when he proclaims, “It’s wild that we could win at Leeds and go fourth; a real reflection of how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season”. I put it to the jury, it’s actually a reflection of how incredibly strong the standard of the league is now.",
      "This is reflected in how tricky games have become against any team in the league, with the exception of Wolves (and Liverpool – titter) who have looked poor up until now (cue them taking points off us on Monday) but even they drew with Spurs and Brighton. It’s not just that my team are consistently inconsistent, I look at the fixture list now and can barely come up for air! Any team on their day will give you a game. Just look at how well the promoted teams can hold their own. Even Burnley – are you confident of your team going to Turf Moor and getting 3 points? Because I sure as shit am not!",
      "Oh you want some evidence and not just anecdotal ramblings of a mad man, you bunch of pedants? Look at how well English teams have been doing in Europe recently. Last season all 4 made it out of the group stages in the CL, with Arsenal and Villa going relatively deep. Spurs and Utd reached the final of the EL (can’t remember who won), and Chelsea breezed through the EC and won it. This season, Arsenal are flying in the CL with the other 4 teams in with a strong chance of qualifying; the same for the teams in the lesser comps (although Palace could be doing better to be fair).",
      "So why is this? Well there is obviously the money. Contrary to what slippery Puffy might have opined, mo money does not equal mo problems in football. Mo money in fact equals better players. However, something that has been nagging at me for years is that the main influence on the league is actually the standard of manager (or coaches) and the evolution of tactics.",
      "I’m not sure how to easily prove or disprove this theory, and maybe the better players and better coaches go hand in hand, like the old nature vs nurture conundrum. Or did the better coaches follow the better players or vice versa, like the old chicken and egg conundrum. But the influx of better coaches (typically foreign – they took our jobs Randy!) and ideas has really ramped up the standard of the league, and improved domestic coaching too.",
      "If there’s an Econometrics student out there looking for an idea for a dissertation, feel free to run a regression model on all of this and write in with the results. Otherwise, you’ll all just have to take my word for it. And when have I ever been wrong, right guys? Guys? Guys?!\nGarey Vance, MUFC",
      "",
      "…In his mail, Monty, LFC wrote that the standard of the Premier League this year is “incredibly low”. This got me thinking. What is the right way to measure the quality of the League? One approach that I can think of is to look at the average points per game so far this season of the teams that finished in the top 6 last season, and compared them to their average points per game over the whole of last season. Here is what I found:",
      "Liverpool (last season = 2.21 / this season = 1.57)\nArsenal (1.95 / 2.36)\nMan City (1.87 / 2.00)\nChelsea (1.82 / 1.71)\nNewcastle (1.74 / 1.36)\nVilla (1.74 / 1.93)",
      "And for good measure, I am going to add Man Utd. and Spurs because they are in the original Big 6.",
      "Man Utd (1.11 / 1.62)\nSpurs (1.00 / 1.36)",
      "Out of these 8 teams (who, in recent seasons, regularly competed for Champions’ League spots), Liverpool, Newcastle, and Chelsea are averaging fewer points per game this season. So, this measure, while inconclusive, does not really indicate that the League is weaker this season. What are other measures that people can suggest?\nNick",
      "",
      "…Ah Monty LFC in this morning’s mailbox wins the bitter fan bingo.",
      "‘….this shows how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season’",
      "Translation: my team is playing badly and can’t beat teams I consider weak or midtable so I’ll say it’s a low standard season.",
      "The alternative opposite view is the league is more competitive than it’s ever been. Currently there’s only 3 genuinely weak teams, but if you’re slightly off it against anyone else particularly away from home you’re liable to get turned over no matter who you are and no matter what perch you’ve toppled off.",
      "In Liverpool’s case the alternative view is also that they are incredibly lucky that so many good sides are taking points off each other to enable Liverpool to stay 1 win away from the Champions League places, as they certainly don’t deserve to be that close based on performances this season. Just think where Liverpool would be if they got the results their performances deserved in the first 5 games of the season!\nRich, AFC",

      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places, but they’re not going to finish in the top five of the Premier League if they don’t a) make some signings in January and b) win more than one game in a row.",
      "Will their finances allow a big spending spree in the winter transfer window? Probably not. Are we going to create a scenario where Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos spend around £250million? Yes. Absolutely.",
      "These five transfers would make for a perfect January for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, with a Liverpool hijack, Vinicius Junior and Mason Greenwood all thrown into the equation.",
      "",
      "It’s obvious that Manchester United need and want to sign a new central midfielder. The question is: who?",
      "If this was Career Mode or Football Manager, it would be one or two of Federico Valverde, Sandro Tonali, Declan Rice, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong or Moises Caicedo. But this is the real world. And in the real world, it’s going to be Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton. Which is still absolutely fine, by the way.",
      "Ruben Amorim is never shifting from his beloved 3-4-2-1 formation, so looking at previously successful English clubs operating in the same way, the Red Devils need a player like Nemanja Matic, N’Golo Kante or Jorginho. So it really isn’t all that simple. The best option, that also happens to be realistic, is Anderson.",
      "The Nottingham Forest star’s 2025/26 statistics put him up there as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. He has made 24 key passes (6th), 802 passes (5th), 111 progressive passes (1st), 111 ball recoveries (1st), 35 tackles (9th), 14 interceptions (23rd), won 29 fouls (2nd), and only received two yellow cards. And in Forest’s defeat to Brighton, Anderson became the first player in the last 10 Premier League seasons to record 100+ touches, 10+ ball recoveries, 10+ duels won, 5+ key passes and 5+ successful dribbles.",
      "He might not be Kante, but he could be Matic, and we’re confident he can become better than Jorginho, if he isn’t already.",
      "It would be a statement signing for Manchester United and there isn’t a better option out there among the players who would actually want to join. The fact he can do absolutely everything and has the engine to play midfield on his own makes him perfect for Amorim’s system. The only issue is the price. In January, you’re looking at £100m. In the summer, maybe closer to £80m. Better, but still very pricey. For England’s No.6, though? Probably worth it…",
      "",
      "Not only would Guehi massively improve United and walk straight in as a leader and their best defender, but signing him means Liverpool don’t, which is probably top of the list of positives, next to a blank column of negatives.",
      "There isn’t really much more to say about it. He would be an absolutely outstanding signing, but the odds are heavily stacked against United.",
      "Liverpool put all the groundwork into signing Guehi last summer and were hours away from getting it done, putting them comfortably ahead of the Red Devils in the race. He can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1, which gives Real Madrid a big advantage. They love a free transfer, need a centre-back and have dropped their interest in Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.",
      "But it’s still in United’s hands if they want it to be. Offer Palace £30m and they might struggle to reject it, considering he’s in the final six months of his deal. Just make a sufficient offer well before the deadline, lads.",
      "Liverpool are also in a much worse place than they were when Guehi agreed to join. They were reigning champions – and still are, technically – and looked set to dominate England and Europe after spending over £420m. Now they are mid-table, out of the title picture, and on an abysmal run of form. It’s not the place to be for someone like Guehi, though he could help fix the problem.",
      "And does Guehi even want to leave England? You’d have to ask him. Some players are reluctant to go abroad, especially if a top English club is offering a fat contract and guaranteed minutes. Real Madrid is the exception, though. You don’t turn down Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "It would be audacious to even try, and the noise surrounding Vinicius‘ situation at Real Madrid is probably a ploy to get a better contract. When he realises his only options are Manchester United or Saudi Arabia, he’ll likely return to Florentino Perez with his tail between his legs.",
      "But let’s say he actually does want to leave and refuses to renew. United would actually stand a chance. They are still, in the eyes of many, the biggest club in the world. They are an institution. Players are addicted to the idea of being ‘the one’ who finally fixes them after years of chaos.",
      "Out of all the big names United could chase, Vinicius would be the most ambitious and exciting. Leaving Real Madrid at 25, after being Ballon d’Or runner-up two years earlier, is not a normal career move. Joining United might be career suicide, but if anyone who is remotely gettable can single-handedly fix them, it’s Vinicius.",
      "",
      "Signing Anderson or Wharton, Guehi, and Vinicius is impossible without a significant sale or two. The best sale for everyone is Ugarte. Casemiro could work if the right offer arrives, but he’s actually been pretty good since Ruben Amorim came in. You could argue he’s been the Portuguese coach’s biggest success story so far. Then there’s Kobbie Mainoo, who is a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ pure profit option.",
      "Truth be told, only Saudi Arabia can bail Manchester United out when it comes to Ugarte. No Champions League contender will want him after back-to-back disappointing spells at two giant clubs. Sporting might want to re-sign him, but for nowhere near the £50m United paid Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. That leaves the filthy-rich Saudis, who will surely be interested in a big name like Ugarte, who is still only 24.",
      "It’s unrealistic, but not completely delusional. And United will only sanction his sale if they’ve already signed a new midfielder, or have one lined up.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules will probably still punish United anyway, but they can at least tell supporters they lived and enjoyed the dream while it lasted.",
      "",
      "Another significant windfall could come via the sale of Mason Greenwood from Marseille.",
      "Reports suggested United wanted to reintegrate Greenwood after his charges of attempted rape and assault were dropped, but after putting the feelers out, fan backlash was fierce. They quickly U-turned and pretended they always wanted to sell him. After a year on loan at Getafe, he joined Marseille for £26.7m, which was a low fee, but United’s hands were tied. In an uncharacteristically savvy move, they included a big sell-on clause, believed to be 50%.",
      "Transfermarkt says the 24-year-old is worth around £35m, but 10 goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season, coupled with his potential and previous seasons, suggests he will go for much more – perhaps around £60m, giving United £30m.",
      "And when Greenwood does leave Marseille, Manchester United will finally be able to close a dark chapter.",
      "READ NEXT: Top 10 transfer flops of the season: Liverpool trio shamed as Premier League clubs waste £500m",
      "Man Utd are ready to splash out on one of two Real Madrid players in the summer, while they want Antoine Semenyo in January, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to break their transfer record next summer on one of two players as they look to bring in a new midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",
      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has been backed to play for England again on one condition as he would solve “many problems”.",
      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100m for Elliot Anderson after Man City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports."

      "World Cup winner Uli Hoeness has been one of the great supporting characters in the Premier League story this season, offering his no-filter takes on transfers like a grandparent with their third Baileys of the evening muttering about the immigration policy in this once green and pleasant land.",
      "The now honorary president of Bayern Munich called Newcastle’s £69m signing of Nick Woltemade “completely crazy”, suggested their record-breaking £13m loan deal of Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea was in fact good business, and can barely open his mouth without saying something salty about Liverpool landing Florian Wirtz ahead of the Bundesliga giants, most recently exposing Arne Slot’s “broken promise” over the playmaker’s shirt number.",
      "He’s a 73-year-old man struggling to come to terms with the Premier League’s gold-laden hands reaching out into a market that Bayern have cornered for decades, plundering the cream of the crop from the Bundesliga that they have historically hoovered up to dominate that division to the tune of 20 titles this century.",
      "“One farmer comes to another and says: I sold two cows for €50,000 each and bought four chickens for €25,000 each,” he joked through gritted teeth when discussing the inflated transfer market.",
      "In a bid to further rattle the old man’s cage, we’ve come up with ten transfers – based mainly on the rumour mill – to encourage what we hope will be some further wonderfully bitter witterings.",
      "",
      "Harry Kane to Chelsea\nA huge long shot for so many reasons, most of which are amusingly listed by the nameless ‘5 elite reporters’ working on the now infamous X account who got one thing right once, were credited by David Ornstein, and are now further buoyed to treat things overheard in a pub or proclaimed by an Uber driver as genuine transfer news.",
      "‘Kane’s age, his hefty wages, and the length of his contract are all hurdles,’ they admit, but insist the Tottenham legend (another ‘hurdle’ they didn’t consider) is Enzo Maresca’s ‘dream target’ who can be ‘the difference-maker in Chelsea’s quest for the Premier League and Champions League titles’.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich\nAfter insisting Bayern only actually paid £11.8m as Jackson and his agent paid the rest, which is definitely actually a very good deal for a striker that would likely cost roughly £1m per goal based on his past goalscoring antics, Hoeness went on to explain why the conditions required to trigger the further £56m to make his loan deal permanent would “never” be met.",
      "“The big money only has to be paid if he starts 40 games. He never does that.”",
      "With just five starts to his name it doesn’t look hugely likely that clause will be met, but a Harry Kane injury or January move could do the trick.",
      "",
      "Michael Olise to Arsenal\nQuite why Arsenal are ‘prepared to submit a record-breaking offer close to €150m (£131m)’ for a guy who’s played 173 games in his career on the right wing when they already have Bukayo Saka and have just signed a very serviceable back-up in Noni Madueke, over signing someone for the left wing, where Olise has played just nine times, isn’t entirely clear.",
      "But we’re not here to question the validity of Fichajes’ claims, we’re here to imagine the steam cascading from Hoeness’ ears when Arsenal sign Bayern’s most valuable player just because they can.",
      "",
      "Lennart Karl to Manchester City\n“It’s like Monopoly: move forward to Schlossallee [the German Mayfair], then some sheikh will come along and then you can buy,” Hoeness said during his rant on Newcastle pinching Woltemade from under their noses.",
      "But there’s more than one sheikh in this multicultural haven (mainly featuring sheikhs and Americans) that we call the Premier League and you, Uli, will soon be forced to admit is The Greatest League In The World.",
      "With Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki you may be asking if City even need Karl, the 17-year-old superstar taking European football by storm, but then you are again missing the point. Need and want are very different things for the clubs able to provide for these players what Bayern aren’t: silly money.",
      "",
      "Aleksandar Pavlovic to Manchester United\n“Uli Hoeness sees Pavlovic as one of the crucial faces of the project for present and future,” Fabrizio Romano said after insisting there’s “absolutely nothing” to the rumours linking the midfielder with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It’s thus absolutely “crucial” in order to push Hoeness over the edge that Manchester United sign him for £60m as the man to fill the midfield doughnut before his inevitable plunge into the pit of despair that’s claimed the last 427 players bought to plug that hole.",
      "",
      "Nico Schlotterbeck to Liverpool\nBayern have a rich, rich history of poaching the best Bundesliga centre-backs. Mats Hummels, Niklas Sule, Dayot Upamecano, Hiroki Ito and Jonathan Tah are the notable recent examples in the last decade.",
      "Schlotterbeck looks to be next on the block, but Liverpool’s need is far greater than theirs, and as proved by their signing of Wirtz, they are a far, far bigger (wealthier) football club.",

      "",
      "Mike Maignan to Chelsea\nChelsea’s summer chase of Maignan appears to have lit a fire under Robert Sanchez, turning him into a strangely competent goalkeeper this season, but the Frenchman – seen by the Bayern powers-that-be as an ideal replacement for Manuel Neuer – will be a free agent in the summer and can take over the domestic cup role currently played by Filip Jorgensen and ahead of the dozen or so alternatives currently on the Blues books playing elsewhere.",

      "Manchester United are running out of turning points.",
      "They can’t keep taking one step forward and then two steps back, and that’s the incredibly unsexy dance they performed once again in their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham after beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "That was a huge win, an unexpected win, against a very good team. They had to back that up with another win against a pretty poor one. Alas, they didn’t.",
      "Ruben Amorim should be criticised for his substitutions, which ultimately cost them victory on Thursday night. He even managed to spark debate with his starting XI.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made the bold call to hand young defender Ayden Heaven his first start of the season, with Matthijs de Ligt – the club’s player of the month – out due to a minor injury. Heaven didn’t come in for De Ligt, but for Leny Yoro, whose dropping to the bench was a “tactical” decision.",
      "Heaven needed to settle quickly, and he did the opposite, smashing into Jarrod Bowen with a slide tackle and receiving a yellow card after only eight minutes. Not ideal, but it clearly didn’t rattle him because he didn’t have a poor first half. Still, he evidently wasn’t good enough in Amorim’s eyes as he was substituted at half-time for Yoro, with the booking clearly concerning the Portuguese.",
      "Heaven starting on Thursday reaffirmed what we already knew: Kobbie Mainoo is in Man United exile.",
      "After emerging as one of the club’s best players under Erik ten Hag, becoming an England regular and starting in the final of Euro 2024, Mainoo can’t get a kick anymore, and a January sale is looking more likely with every passing week.",
      "Another appearance on the bench while Heaven was in the starting XI left Mainoo in worrying company with Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia as United’s only first-team players yet to start in the Premier League this season. If you were unsure, that’s their third-choice goalkeeper, a guy who has been injured all season, and someone who was in Amorim’s pre-season bomb squad.",
      "While his standing in the Red Devils’ squad hierarchy is striking, it’s not like he’d have transformed a cautious United performance.",
      "Amorim has said that he’s competing for a starting spot with club captain and best player Bruno Fernandes, and from the minor minutes we’ve seen of them together, it actually makes sense. But for Mainoo, it’s a horrible situation; Fernandes is literally undroppable. His form needs to fall off a cliff to be benched, and he’s only missed nine Premier League games in five full seasons, largely due to suspension.",
      "Casemiro has also been pretty good in midfield for the Red Devils and is Amorim’s biggest success story. He has been criticised for his rashness in the past, but he is more disciplined in that position than Mainoo.",
      "Man United fans are desperate to see Mainoo play more because they love him and he’s an academy graduate with incredible potential, but during a disappointing performance against West Ham, there can’t have been many people watching and thinking the game was crying out for him.",
      "Their performance made for a very dull first half at Old Trafford, highlighted largely by Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s defensive contributions.",
      "The first genuine moment of quality came from Alphonse Areola, who acrobatically tipped Bryan Mbeumo’s cross-cum-shot over the bar, denying United another set-piece goal that would have seen them overtake Arsenal in that statistic in the 2025/26 Premier League season.",
      "In terms of attacking quality, that was really all she wrote in the opening 45 minutes. There was a brief flurry of shots that could have sparked Ruben Amorim’s men into life; Wan-Bissaka cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off the line, Matheus Cunha had an overhead kick blocked, and Bruno Fernandes’ scissor volley clipped the post. It wasn’t the shot in the arm United needed, just three shots.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was player of the half, adding an incredible sliding tackle on Cunha in his own box before producing an expertly read headed clearance from a tantalising Fernandes cross.",
      "It was unfortunately much of the same when the game restarted, but in a match between two teams that can be excruciating to watch that was crying out for a goal, we finally got one just before the hour mark, and in fairness, it did improve proceedings.",
      "Diogo Dalot benefited from a bit of luck when Casemiro’s blocked shot fell straight to him, though he still had plenty to do. His first touch was perfect and the finish was that of an experienced No.9, shifting the ball past Wan-Bissaka and in the opposite direction of Areola’s momentum.",
      "Beating West Ham at home was the only acceptable outcome for United, and going up into the Champions League places would’ve been a welcome bonus. But after taking the lead, they didn’t push for a second, and as the second didn’t come and their opponents found an equaliser, Amorim’s substitutions will rightly be criticised.",
      "Patrick Dorgu on for the goalscorer, Manuel Ugarte for Matheus Cunha, and Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee suggested that Amorim thought it had to be a case of holding onto the one-goal lead rather than pressing on against one of the worst teams in the Premier League this year and putting the game to bed.",
      "Ironically, when Nuno Espírito Santo brought on Andy Irving, his first contribution was to instantly take a corner kick that led to Soungoutou Magassa’s 83rd-minute equaliser.",
      "United might feel aggrieved that Wan-Bissaka wasn’t shown the most blatant of second yellow cards you’ll see all season, but the fact of the matter is that they didn’t do nearly enough to win the game.

      "Man Utd fans are desperate to see Mainoo make it, especially after he starred under former manager Erik ten Hag and quickly emerged as one of the club’s best players.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for a Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances which now incredibly sees Frank-less Brentford above Frank’s Tottenham.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",

      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that.

      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault.",

      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But , well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs went to Newcastle – and got a barely deserved draw – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ and a rare home win over Chelsea does anything more than delay the inevitable.",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend card...",
      "Freddie Potts has made a big impression since stepping into the West Ham midfield, adding much needed steel, aggression and tenacity to an area that was lacking under Graham Potter. The midfielder has been fouled eight times in his last four starts and across his last 31 club starts he's averaging 1.8 fouls won per-game.",
      "Only three teams have made more fouls since the start of last season than Brighton, who play a very high-tempo and aggressive game in midfield. Potts to be fouled at least twice at 5/4 with Sky Bet is a tasty prop to attack.",
      "This is usually part of the season where Marco Silva's team find rhythm and are peak performance level. Whilst other teams, like Crystal Palace, are flagging due to fighting on multiple fronts, Silva's team play with an added edge. In the period after the final international break and Boxing Day, Silva has a Premier League win strike-rate of 52 per cent from 19 matches. That's a huge figure for a club with the expectations of Fulham.",
      "One of their wins that has slipped under the radar was their 1-0 win over Sunderland at home. The metrics behind that win were so strong, winning the expected goals battle 2.16-0.17 and posting 24 shots, 18 of which came from inside the box. They dominated a team who have proved to be a very difficult opponent for Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool this season.",
      "And Palace are a team to bet against when the time is right during this hectic period. This is their fifth game in 16 days and Oliver Glasner has made the fewest changes to Premier League starting XI's this season (12). Palace are a fantastic team but this group can't keep going to the well and performing at the highest level. Fulham to win at 8/5 with Sky Bet does the job.",
      "Hold your breath, Wolves fans, this isn't going to be pretty.",
      "Wolves have joint-fewest points (2) after 14 games by any team in a top division season and have lost their last seven Premier League games, going 495 minutes without a goal. Rob Edwards has got the same amount of bounce as throwing a brick on the floor.",
      "But in football, these runs don't last forever. They snap. And when they do, it's often in a fixture where the market has started to write the goal-shy side off.",
      "A six-hour scoring drought isn't a reflection of a team with no threat, it's a reflection of a team due a correction and variance. And there are few defences better suited to gifting opportunities right now than Manchester United's away from home. Since April 1, it's no joke that United have gone 12 away games without a clean sheet, conceding 24 goals - only Bournemouth have conceded more in that period. Also, their expected goals against of 1.72 per 90 is the worst of any ever-present Premier League side during those 12 games.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals is the play at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "The final will be held in Rabat almost a month later on January 18, meaning it could be a long Christmas and New Year period for some Premier League sides without a number of key players",

      "Most nations are yet to announce their final squads but going by recent selection and injury status, here's the realistic scenario for how many players each Premier League club could lose to the tournament...",
      "Of the 458 players used in the Premier League, 45 have been from the African continent - with Sunderland the most reliant on their ranks. All seven of their African players arrived in the summer, and all seven look set to be called up to their respective squads for AFCON.",

      "There are no worries for Arsenal, Chelsea, Leeds and Newcastle who haven't been represented by a single African player between them this season - and will not see their squads impacted by the tournament.",
      "Sunderland might have given almost a third of their playing minutes to African players but given all of their three attacking signings have struggled for minutes, they find themselves well down the list of goals and assists across the Premier League this season.",
      "Instead, Fulham lead the way on that front, not least after Samuel Chukwueze's double and Alex Iwobi's finish in their pulsating 5-4 defeat to Man City.",
      "Individually, no African player has contributed more to his side's attacking output than Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, piquing further interest from Premier League suitors ahead of a potential January transfer - when a new release clause will come into being, albeit only briefly.",
      "Whether he stays or goes, for the moment Bournemouth will be happy to keep their flying forward at the Vitality Stadium for the next month, with Ghana finishing bottom of their qualifying group and missing out on AFCON for the first time since 2004.",
      "On paper at least, Aston Villa have the hardest set of fixtures across the six Premier League rounds played during AFCON.",
      "Man Utd are slated to have the easiest, facing both Wolves and Burnley, ranked 20th and 19th, in that time.",
      "Sunderland, the team losing the most players to the competition, have the triple whammy of facing Man City, Brighton and Crystal Palace across the month.",
      "Man Utd play Bournemouth on Monday Night Football on December 15, after the deadline for clubs to release their players for AFCON.",
      "The club have been in talks over extending that deadline for their three affected players - Noussair Mazraoui, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo - to feature in that game, but it is still not clear whether that will be possible.",
      "Speaking ahead of their game with Wolves, Ruben Amorim was asked if he had received any clarification about when he may lose the trio and replied: \"No, with everything, They are going to play the next game [at Molineux] and that is the only thing I care [about].\"",

      "Ayden Heaven, making his first start since the debacle against Grimsby, was withdrawn at half-time having picked up an early booking, but the United boss maintained his 3-4-3 structure, of course. And it was his left wing-back of all people who opened the scoring.",
