      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana was unable to guarantee that he'll be fit for the start of the new Premier League campaign after missing all of their pre-season fixtures so far. Onana, 29, suffered a hamstring injury during United's first week of training last month.",
      "The Red Devils weren't at their best as they drew 2-2 with fellow tourists Everton in Atalanta, Georgia, although they did enough to win the Premier League Summer Series. But when the real stuff gets going for United against Arsenal on Sunday, August 17, Onana could still be on the sidelines, even though he feels 'great' ahead of their final pre-season friendly at home to Fiorentina on Saturday.",
      "On United's chances of a successful 2025-26 season, Onana added: \"If we have a good start against Arsenal, everything is possible.\"",
      "Speaking last week, Amorim insisted that Onana would have a better season amid simmering speculation that the Red Devils boss wants to bring in a new goalkeeper as competition for the 29-year-old. But Amorim's observations from training have poured cold water on replacement talk.",
      "\"I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers,\" the United manager began. \"Even Tom is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper. Altay did really well, and Onana is going to be better, like the other guys, this year.\"",
      "Amorim's comments were in line with his larger assessment of United ahead of his first full season at Old Trafford. \"I think are we better in every detail, in the organisation of the day-by-day,\" the Portuguese explained.",
      "\"The nutrition is better, the way we cook, what we eat, how we prepare training. I think that we are more organised. I think we have people now that help us to be better. I'm not concerned with small things and I was last year.",
      "\"So, those things help us and help me to think more about watching the game, watching the team. So it's a big help for me. When it's a big help for the technical staff, it's a big help for the players.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Bryan Mbeumo made a promising start to life at Manchester United but has conceded the forward is still getting up to speed. The forward made his first start for the club as the Red Devils won the Premier League Summer Series following a 2-2 draw with Everton in the United States.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, played the opening 45 minutes of the clash in which Amorim's side put in a frustrating display. The club's newest signing arrived in a £71million deal from Brentford to join up with the squad for their pre-season tour but made his first appearance on Sunday, having previously only participated in training.",
      "The forward played in attack with Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha against the Toffees in Atlanta and occupied positions across the whole of the front three. Mbeumo already appears to have been handed some responsibility too as he took on some free-kicks for his new team.",
      "Cameroon international Mbeumo played a role in United's opening goal as he delivered a first-time pass to Amad, who went on to win a penalty that Fernandes converted. And he went close to opening his account after having two shots blocked in quick succession.",
      "But Amorim warned that Mbeumo must still get up speed ahead of the new season and explained his new charge would continue to learn his role in the side.",
      "\"He played well,” said Amorim. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but [his] first touch, the way you connect with one touch, open[ing] a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he’s not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",
      "United have been linked with more additions this summer, with the club said to be in contention to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. The Red Devils face competition from Newcastle for the striker's signature.",
      "And the Premier League giants are still looking to offload a number of stars including Antony and Jadon Sancho. But Amorim has suggested he would be happy with this squad heading into the season.",
      "\"Of course, one team can also always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition,” Amorim continued. “We need to improve as a team. We have potential to improve with our players. I'm really happy with the squad.\"",

And now he is set to be afforded an opportunity to impress over a longer period with Hull hoping to get a deal ratified ahead of their first match of the season against Coventry City, per Hull Live.",
      "Williams, 24, was released by United little over a year ago and has been without a club since. Earlier this year he was handed a suspended jail sentence for a 99mph car crash.",
      "The Red Devils academy product was sentenced to a 14-month jail term, suspended for two years, at Chester Crown Court. In the aftermath, he stated his ambition to get back on the pitch.",
      "“I have always accepted that my driving that day fell below the standard that is expected of me. It was never my intention to cause injury to anyone but I am responsible for the standard of my driving. I make no excuses. I have learnt from this experience and will ensure there is no repetition.",
      "“I wish to apologise again to those who were involved in the accident. Now that the case has concluded I look forward to resuming my career with a new team later this year.”",

      "\"I spoke with him very honestly, and I explained to him what I expect from him. We will be very careful, very, very slow. We have time, so we will try to help him.",
      "\"I think the quality is there because he was on a high level at Man United, so his quality is there. We need him to bring good fitness, and then we will make a decision. For me, his mentality is good. From our conversations, he's a very normal guy.",
      "\"He just asked me yesterday (Monday), 'can I play?' and then I asked him, 'do you feel comfortable to play some minutes?' His desire is there, and so is the hard work. On Saturday, we left him here in Hull to carry on training and so far, everything has gone according to the plan.\"",

      "Fernandes, who played the full 90 minutes, scored the opener from the penalty spot, but Ruben Amorim’s side twice relinquished the lead, which drew a strong reaction from the skipper. “It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,” said Fernandes.",
      "“It’s a game of football, there’s always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it’s normal, it is part of the game.",
      "“It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players. We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that.",
      "“I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about. I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "United ended last season in 15th place, their lowest finish for half a century, with Fernandes admitting there had to be a change in attitude and mentality after such an embarrassing campaign.",
      "\"It’s every detail, every small detail matters,” said Fernandes. \"At this football club you can’t do anything wrong on the pitch and off the pitch, because it’s too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "“You get the attention of the media and your fans and you have to be aware of that. At this club the culture here was winning and we need to bring that back.",
      "\"Not only the winning mentality that we need, and I think that’s always been there, but obviously if you don’t win you don’t show it.",
      "\"The club is trying to improve other things, the facilities have improved, we tried to improve the team, the staff, a lot of things. A lot of people have suffered from this, a lot of people who had been working at the club for many, many years had to go.",
      "\"The fans are paying more for tickets and we appreciate all the effort they put in for us so now it’s up to us to pay it back on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim said he welcomed such straight-talking from Fernandes and said it showed his skipper knows there is still much work to done for United to get back to challenging for the major trophies.",
      "“I’m happy for the players to have that feeling,” said Amorim. “It's saying that they understand the situation. So it's a good feeling.",

That, however, may require a number of players to exit the club and reports suggest five different members of the first-team squad could potentially move on.",

      "Manchester United and Everton played out a draw in the final game of the Premier League Summer Series at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium.",
      "Bruno Fernandes gave United the lead from the penalty spot, before Iliman Ndiaye equalised with a fine angled finish. Substitute Mason Mount restored United's lead, but an Ayden Heaven own goal 15 minutes from time ensured it ended honours even.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side lifted the trophy, after remaining unbeaten in the Stateside mini-tournament, with two wins and a draw. Here are five talking points from the final fixture of the US tour:",
      "Bryan Mbeumo made his long-awaited United debut, following his £71million move from Brentford, having sat out the first two tour games in the US to work on his fitness.",
      "Playing as a right-sided No.10, Mbeumo had a quiet start to the game, but played a role in United's opener, delivering a first-time pass to Amad, who won a generous penalty when he went down after little contact from James Tarkowski, with Fernandes converting from the spot.",
      "Mbeumo had earlier been involved in a slick attacking move involving Fernandes, Amad and Matheus Cunha, the latter unable to get his shot on target. Mbeumo was unlucky not to score just before the half-hour, when he had two shots blocked in quick succession, racing on to the loose ball after Jordan Pickford had blocked a Fernandes effort. Mbeumo was replaced at half-time by Patrick Dorgu and United's newest recruit still has work to do to get up to full fitness for the start of the new season.",
      "Manuel Ugarte was one of United's most impressive players in their opening tour game, a 2-1 win over West Ham at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. Pressing high, winning back possession with tenacity and speed, Ugarte's high-tempo performance suggested he was in pole position to start United's Premier League opener at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Here, though, the Uruguay midfielder's shortcomings resurfaced, never more so than in the 40th minute, when he attempted to bring the ball out from just outside of his own penalty area, only to be dispossessed by James Tarkowski. Idrissa Gueye picked up the loose ball and crossed for Iliman Ndiaye, who applied a clinical angled finish at the far post to make it 1-1. The goal was entirely Ugarte's fault and it remains to be seen if Amorim feels he can trust him to start against Arsenal.",
      "At the start of United's US tour, Amorim said he had “big plans” for Kobbie Mainoo this season, in contrast to last term, when the England midfielder fell out of favour under his new boss. A sub for United's final three games, Maino came on with a minute left as United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham. On tour, however, Amorim's selection and praise of Mainoo suggests the 21-year-old will play a bigger role in the upcoming season.",
      "“Mainoo, with those feet, playing the ball, if he finds the right pace, I will find a new solution,” said Amorim. “He's going to be faster.” Unlike Ugarte, Mainoo looked assured in midfield, with Fernandes – who played deeper in the previous game - operating higher up the pitch. Given the way last season fizzled out for him, the upcoming one is one of huge significance for Mainoo, for club and country, with the World Cup back here in the US at the end of it.",
      "Having been a hostage to injury for most of his two seasons at United, following his £60m move from Chelsea, Mason Mount has become a somewhat forgotten man. Although he ended last season on a positive note, returning to the starting line-up for the Europa League final and scoring three goals, the jury remains out on Mount because of his unavailability through injury.",
      "But on tour he has looked sharp and, most importantly, free from the persistent injury issues that have held him back from showing his best since joining United. Here, Mount showcased his goal threat, producing a fine angled finish 10 minutes after coming on in the second-half, to put United ahead.",
      "Although there will be huge competition at United next season, with one game a week following their failure to qualify for Europe, Mount has served notice he can play a key role and make up for lost time.",
      "Too often, these pre-season games can be insipid affairs, where players play within themselves to avoid injury or overload before the start of the new campaign. But there has been a competitive edge to all six games as part of the Premier League Summer series and, in this encounter, some needle between United skipper Fernandes and Everton goalscorer Iliman Ndiaye.",
      "Deep into the second-half, Fernandes tried to recover the ball from Ndiaye, with a robust challenge from behind that the Senegal forward deemed too excessive. Pushes were exchanged between Fernandes and Ndiaye, with team-mates rushing to intervene between them, while play continued and Everton made it 2-2 with an own goal from Ayden Heaven. When the dust had settled on their flare-up, Fernandes and Ndiaye made up, but not before both had been shown yellow cards.",

      "Berrada, speaking before United's final US tour game against Everton in Atlanta, said he, director of football Jason Wilcox and boss Ruben Amorim are doing all they can to strengthen the squad with new faces.",
      "“We have to do a lot of multitasking,” said Berrada. “We have a team back home led by Jason, the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it.",
      "“Of course, adding players helps. We have seen the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. They have adapted really well.",
      "“We've seen Bryan play for the first time, Matheus has already shown his quality and Diego has shown that he is adapting very quickly, having just come from Paraguay, so all of the signs are positive and we are cautiously optimistic. We hope we're going to have a great season.",
      "“The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level. We have very high standards, Ruben is very clear about that and so is Jason.",
      "“It's something we want to see with the players, with the staff, with everyone, because what we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",
      "“It's about raising standards, being very disciplined and the way you approach the application of those standards. We have to make sure that everybody abides by them, that everybody believes in them and that nobody falls out of line. It is really important for us to create that sense of togetherness around a single idea.”",
      "Reflecting on United's three-game US tour, Berrada said: “It's been amazing, it's been very good. I'm really pleased with how it's gone.",
      "“The team has trained really well, the interaction with the fans, activations with our partners, everything has been excellent. The Premier League has put on an excellent tournament.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The burst down the right hand side, the cut inside onto the left foot, the finish.",
      "It became something of a trademark for Bryan Mbeumo at Brentford, but if the Cameroonian's first outing in a Manchester United shirt is anything to go by then we're going to be seeing that signature move a lot less.",
      "On this evidence, as Mbeumo played in attack with Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha against Everton in Atlanta, he's going to be tasked with making an impact all across the front line and not just down the right, where he was a constant menace and presence across most of his 242 Brentford appearances.",
      "Fluidity is going to be the watchword for this particular United attack, with Mbeumo taking up all three positions in the front line across the first half hour, and as a result Fernandes and Cunha doing the same.",
      "With the width given by wing-backs Amad and Diogo Dalot, Mbeumo and Cunha were often required to focus their attentions on haring towards goal from deep, with Fernandes pulling the strings behind them and moving into ever dangerous positions.",
      "The link-up play between the trio was promising in the opening exchanges, but Fernandes had already scored from the penalty spot - something Mbeumo would often do for Brentford - before the debutant would start to exert his authority on the game.",
      "Notably Mbeumo was on free-kicks for United, and after a poor delivery into the box for his first, he brought a save from Jordan Pickford from one closer to goal. Shortly afterwards Mbeumo was the first to react as Pickford pushed out a Fernandes shot, but Vitaliy Mykolenko blocked impressively.",
      "Ever willing to get involved, Mbeumo found that his close control let him down on a couple of occasions later in the first half, and that is an area that he is going to have to improve in the role that he will be expected to play.",
      "As if to underline the flexibility within his side, Amorim withdrew Mbeumo at half-time and replaced him with Patrick Dorgu, shifting Amad further forward into that ever-changing attack.",
      "That change will have been to protect Mbeumo's legs in his first outing of pre-season, as the new arrival got a glimpse of just what will be expected of him at his new club.",
      "He's going to have to do more than just his Brentford trick, and while he is certainly capable of it, it might just take a little time to get up to speed with his new surroundings.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Ander Herrera transfer saga of 2013 was a unique situation that saw Manchester United miss their target for the strangest of reasons. The Red Devils were known to be in pursuit of the former Spain midfielder when three agents sought to hijack the transfer.",
      "David Moyes, who was United manager at the time, said the deal collapsed due to Athletic Bilbao's extortionate demands over the fee. However, fans could hardly believe their eyes when reports emerged suggesting the move was actually off because 'impostors' claiming to act on United's behalf had arrived at Athletic's offices offering to pay his buyout clause on deadline day.",
      "The details were like something out of a Hollywood script rather than transfer negotiations. So many will have been even more shocked to hear Herrera himself confirm that truly was the reason his move to Old Trafford never materialised 12 years ago.",
      "\"I didn't even know them,\" the 35-year-old said on the UTD Podcast in 2022. \"I know my lawyers and I know my agent. It is the same agent as when I was 18. They [hoaxers] were trying to make easy money – I don't know how.",
      "\"I think they wanted to be there if the negotiation was successful, they wanted everyone to think that they were the ones who did it and, maybe after that, they can have more players or more negotiations.",
      "\"But I didn't even know them, honestly. It was funny because some of my friends say, 'Your lawyers are in La Liga and they are going to pay the money,' and I said, 'No, they are not my lawyers. I do not know them.'\"",
      "La Liga sources appeared eager to downplay the 'impostor' aspect of the storyline at the time, insisting the three lawyers, Rodrigo Garcia Lucas, Alvaro Reig Gurrea and Guillermo Gutierrez, were indeed working for United. Moyes added more intrigue when the Scot admitted that the collapse was due to the club feeling \"the buyout was the wrong valuation.\"",
      "After missing out on Herrera, United instead rushed through a £27.5m deadline-day deal for Marouane Fellaini from Everton.",
      "The Herrera debacle went down as one of the more obscure transfer failures witnessed in modern times as United endured a slow summer of business under Moyes. There was a sentiment United were under-prepared in navigating the complexities of Spanish football's transfer system at such a late juncture in the window.",
      "Lucas, Gurrea and Gutierrez were the same three lawyers responsible for orchestrating Javi Martinez's blockbuster move to Bayern Munich in 2012. However, while that deal had been drawn up over the course of a month, they were attempting to execute Herrera's 2013 transfer in a matter of days (at most).",
      "Herrera, now playing for Argentinian giants Boca Juniors, moved to Manchester the following year after Louis van Gaal replaced Moyes at the helm. And United facilitated the move by transferring funds so the midfielder could trigger his own buyout clause.",
      "The Basque icon made 189 appearances for United, the same number of outings he managed for Athletic across two separate stints. He won the Europa League, an FA Cup and one League Cup during his time in England before joining Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2019.",

      "Ruben Amorin sat down in Chicago from a break during Manchester United's summer tour of the US and chatted openly and honestly about his first season in charge, the challenges he faced and why he believes he will lead the fallen giants back to the top, where so many other managers have failed.",
      "Ruben, we've spoken a lot to the players here. They've said it's been a very positive tour. They've talked a lot about the change of culture that they feel is happening. When you arrived, what was the culture like and what have you done to try and change it?",
      "“First of all, I think it's one thing that is all about the club. It's not one person that arrives and says we need to change everything. Omar and Jason, they were aligned about everything we need to change. Of course, the manager is an important piece. Because if the manager doesn't want [it], it's really hard. But I feel that we are more organised nowadays. I think everybody knows their places. You know that this is my job. Everyone knows that. And that looks like a small thing, but it's a big thing. I think we improved in even the medical department, the nutrition. We are so much better. What we eat, the way we behave on tour, on the pitch. The rules. I think everything is important. I know that they are not kids and I don't treat the players like kids. But I think these small rules can help a group to be strong.”",
      "You said there that it's been made to feel like it's your job. Do you feel like you've been given the authority to make all those changes you've just made? And that it's your way?",
      "“I don't know, but I think all the managers that come here can change things and can dictate some things around the team. I think that is clear. But the manager cannot do that by himself. Because I cannot change, I cannot contract people. There are some things that I don't know. So I need to have top people around me to help me to change the culture. So I think it's not the question of if I have the authority. It's my job. They [the club] want that. But it's bigger than that. I need all the club in the same direction.”",
      "I know you don't want to dwell too much on last season. But because it was so tough, was there ever a point last season where you thought I don't know if I can change this?",
      "“It's not that feeling. But there was mostly a feeling that I'm disappointing all these people. That was the feeling that made me think 'what should I do?' There were some moments last year that were really hard on me. Not because...I know what to do to change the club, but because I'm disappointing all these people. And I know that in football, when you lose so many games, it's hard on everybody to believe in one idea and all the changes. So there were some moments last year that I was really, really frustrated.”",
      "You said in your last press conference that you don't need new players to have a new team. I think some fans will think that results were so poor last season that you need a load of new players. You obviously don't feel like that?",
      "“Yeah. I think if you look at every player, I think everyone can look at the player and say, he can play better. I have that feeling. And I think it's more, I say that so many times, it's a team thing. It's more like all the culture, the pace, the intensity, all these things. It's to understand the way we want to play. Last year was tough to do that with so many games and so many problems. That is the truth. We are in a better place, but we are just beginning. Because even the pressure of the game is going to be different. We are playing well, you can feel more freedom in the players. But then, when it starts, the Premier League is going to be different. We will be ready for that. But I truly believe that there are a lot of players who can do better. And I can do better.”",
      "It maybe feels like a long way off, but do you at this club, if everything was to go right, that this club could still be Premier League, Champions League winners? Do you feel like everything is here for that to happen in the future?",
      "“I have no doubts, because there are some things that you cannot buy. And this club has. The pedigree, the history, the fans. We have that. I think that is clear. Then the money. We have money. We have money without the Champions League. So we can, we'll have money and more money in the future. And we are doing everything. You talk with Omar and all these guys, they are making all the strategy to have more money in the future. So that will not be a problem. And then I think it's clearly the culture. If we have a different culture, with all that, with all the pedigree, the money, all these things, we can return to our place. And that is clear.”",
      "You mentioned about last season and how you felt. But for someone who has gone into management and everything has gone pretty well, you come to England, you've got a young family. What did it feel like when you were going home after another defeat and more problems and more negativity? How did that feel when you got back?",
      "“To tell you the truth, it's not how I returned to my house after the games. How I left to go to the games. Because I felt that sometimes we will struggle. All the struggles that we had in the games, I feel it before the games. So that is the hardest part. To go to the games and know that we are not going to be competitive, how we should be. That is the hardest part. When I returned, I just looked to my family and tried to think in different things. But I was really frustrated. But if you want to know the most difficult moment, it was before the games. Because I knew that we will struggle in specific games.”",
      "Is that feeling gone now?",
      "“Nowadays I'm better. I'm completely… I can feel... I'm more excited. I think also I learned a lot. Small things. How to build up. How to sometimes not be so romantic. All these things are gone now. I think we will be a better team. Not just because I truly believe that we can be better. But I truly believe that I will be better managing the season.”",
      "You did have support in the stadium. That's not unusual for Manchester United managers and supporters. The team did finish 15th. Everybody knows. You know. I know. Everyone knows. That is not acceptable. But most people have said we trust Ruben to get it right. And you say it will be better. Is that a pressure? Because against Arsenal, against Fulham, against Burnley, against Man City, against Chelsea, it has to be better otherwise people will say you're lying to us.",
      "“Yeah. It's not... Sometimes you are right or wrong. But if I say it, it's because I believe it. And that is really clear. And again, we cannot control the results. But the way we play, the way we perform, the way we connect with the fans, all these small things, we are going to do it no matter what. And so that is going to improve our club and is going to improve our team. And I know that all the credit that I had when I arrived, I know that last year was used on that. And now we have to perform. And I really like the pressure. And I will be OK. If I have the feeling that before the game that we are going to be competitive we'll be OK. I just don't want to return to that feeling that we are thinking that it's not a 50-50 game.”",
      "How do you deal personally with pressure?",
      "“I think this is not the moment that I felt more pressure in my life. I had my career as a player and I remember to finish my career really soon because of the injuries. I remember that me and my wife we have an Excel with all the money that we have, all the things that I need. I want to help my family. All this responsibility. And I felt the pressure in that time. Nowadays, I don't feel any pressure about that. I just don't. It's more like an ego thing. I want to be manager of Manchester United for a while. And I took five years to choose this club so I don't want to fail. That is the only pressure. The other pressure that is that pressure at the end of my career as a footballer was different. That was more difficult to deal with.”",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was here for a long time. But everybody that's followed has gone after two or three years. You must feel you need to stay longer than that?",
      "“Yeah, I want to stay. I want to stay 20. That is my goal and I truly believe in that. Something will happen. Always do. In some moments I will be lucky. I had a lot of luck during my career as a manager and my idea is to stay for many years. But again we know that the results will dictate that. I know that last season I used all the credits but I'm ready to start fresh.”",
      "I know you want to speak about the players who are here but the players who aren't here obviously generate a lot of headlines. Marcus clearly has gone to Barcelona. You still have four players there that you didn't bring on tour. you mentioned that they may come back in the squad but most people don't think they will. You go back home to the training ground on Wednesday. What do they do? What do you do? How does that interaction work?",
      "\"I think it's like we just need to follow the markets. So the market is open. There are players that clearly show that they don't want to be here and that is normal. They are not bad and I’m good. I'm not the bad and they are good. it's not that situation. It's a simple situation that they want new challenges. So we will try to use this space to prepare the team that I think is going to be here. If the market closes and then they are Manchester United players we as a club have to treat them in the same conditions. But in this moment I'm just working with the players that I think is going to stay and the other guys are trying to find a solution for their careers.\"",
      "You said that you don't need a lot of players this year because there is no Europe we don't know how the Cups will go. Is this squad the right size or have you still got too many players or is this what you will work?",
      "\"I think we have a good size. Of course we have young kids that are not going to be 100% of the time with us. Something can happen but for someone to come to our team we need to do all that work that we did with Brian and Cunha. We need to be really careful to assess the character the way they play. Try to imagine if they play abroad, try to imagine them physically, technically playing in our club. But I'm really happy with the team and without European competitions I want a small squad so everyone feels really important. If you have a lot of players you have one week to prepare and a lot of players are going to be out and then in training they will be frustrated and then the training will drop, the quality. So I want a small group. I think we need to improve the academy. We need to use all the academy players to put in these positions to have space to train in. the first team.\"",
      "Was the Malaysia and Hong Kong post-season tour the end of last season or was that the start of a new beginning?",
      "\"I think it was more the end. I think if you look to everybody, everyone was really tired. Everyone was really frustrated. I was really happy for the end of the season. I think we start. We start the new season when we catch the plane to return to Manchester.\"",
      "How confident are you about this season?",
      "\"Confident. When I see team training and team playing, my humour - you call it humour - it goes with the team. If I feel that everything is aligned, I feel more excited. If I feel more excited, I see more video, I see more football, I have more ideas. So I'm really confident in this moment.\"",
      "You look quite animated and excited. At times last season, you didn't look that way. Did you ever have any doubts about what you'd taken on at this club?",
      "“It's not the case of not knowing what to do to change the club. I felt last season in some moments I just needed to survive to the end. Because everything I need to do, I will need to do with a new start, with more time, with some changes that I cannot do now. And that is even people around the staff and players. My goal in that moment, three months to the end, was trying to win the Europa League. We struggled a lot, trying to save players, to play 60 minutes. You play against Newcastle, all these clubs, and you have to perform. Or else we will have problems, but you need to take one guy 60 minutes. And you cannot do it in Manchester United. You cannot think like that. I cannot change three guys because I have to try to maintain the team fit to win the Europa League. I had that feeling during the season that I'm so frustrated, I cannot do nothing and I acknowledge that, so I have to wait. And to wait, and being manager of Manchester United, is like going to a fight with my hands like this (puts hands down his side). So that was the frustration.\"",
      "Did you have conversations with the club at that period? Reassurances? Because you're so much surviving, it felt maybe fragile at that point, that you might even think you had to walk away at that point.",
      "\"No, to walk away is more an ego thing. I'm like that. If you saw Sporting: I won the league and we had the second place in the next year, in the third year, when we lost Matheus Nunes, Palhinha, and all these guys, we were fourth in the league, and I put my place in the... So it's a thing that my agent says, you don't need to sign a big contract. Because when things go bad, I put my place, because it's, I don't know, maybe an ego thing. I'm maybe really romantic about things.\"",
      "I think people appreciate that emotional side to you, that you've got that connection with the club and with the fans. How do you translate that into making this a successful season? What kind of things are you doing on this pre-season tour?",
      "\"I think we need to be a little bit more emotional in this team. With the emotion, we become more sacrifice, more pace, more energy. And I think we are improving on that. I think competition is going to help. So if you see the teams like, if Cunha is playing, Mason is on the bench. Bruno and Kobbie are in the same position. Of course, Bruno can do different positions and even Kobbie. So these things are going to help us. And I think it's a perfect year to do that without European competition. So we need to put the standards, and then I think we'll be ready in the next season, in the other season, to cope with less trainings and all the culture is already here, so we can play, play, play.\"",
      "How important was the cultural change that you've implemented? How important was it to make those changes and try and change the culture around this club?",
      "\"I think it's really important, especially when you are losing. Sometimes you have that feeling that we are losing, let's change a little bit the standards just for them to be with me. I didn't feel that last season and they also saw that. So they understand that when I say one thing, I will do it. That is really important. And I think the change of culture is more a club thing than a manager thing. I cannot do everything by myself. But I think we improved in every department. Medical department, nutrition, we have a new chef, we have new rules. We have rules, and the rules are not to treat the players as babies. They have sons. I treat them as a man, but they have rules now. And that can change the way you train. If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you. And I show you in front of everybody. So I'm always on top. I will expect to be in one phase, that I don't need to do anything. Because they will push each other. But in the moment, if you train one time bad, I will show you the image. I will not speak with you, just speak. I will show everything. So that really requires a lot of energy. But what I feel in this year is that I have more people to do that. And we have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys now. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with that. I said to them in this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.\"",
      "Who is in the leadership group?",
      "\"We have Bruno, we have Licha, we have Harry, we have Diogo, we have Tom and we have Nous. So it's not just the oldest one, Nous is in the group because he's a character that I like. And I try to understand the dynamic of the group. Try to reach every space. They are the guys that are responsible to keep everyone in line.\"",
      "You made a couple of big signings this summer. I know your focus is only on United but you look at Liverpool, who have made significant signings, spent a lot of money. They were champions last season. Manchester City have done a similar thing. Is there a concern that you look at them and you think that gap is only just going to increase and, whatever you do, it's not going to bring you closer to them?",
      "\"I think if we were in a different moment, I would be more concerned about that. We have so big issues here that I'm so excited to change all these things that I'm not thinking in that way. If we had maybe a better season, we are looking at less problems, I would look at the opponents and say, I'm just focused on what we need to improve here. I'm really happy with the players that we bring. They proved in the Premier League, so I'm not concerned about the physical aspect. If they are fit to play in the Premier League, if they are struggling. I'm really happy with that. I'm really happy with the character. And I think it's a good thing. I think it personally, I think Jason and also Omar, that all the players that we want to bring to Manchester, any coach will want them. This is not my style. And I can guarantee you, if you bring any manager here, they will say, Bryan Mbeumo? Thank you. Matheus Cunha? Thank you. And then you have the potential of these kids that are really important for us. And when we have a really, really, really strong base, I think it's going to be the core business to bring these really potential guys to fill in the team because it's really hard to buy players.\"",
      "And as the target next season, Europe, we spoke to quite a few of the players who said that an immediate return to Europe has to be the priority. Whether that's top four or not.",
      "\"I know that is a massive gap, from where we finished last season and the Europa League. But it's Manchester United. We need to return to Europe.\"",
      "You said you're happy with the squad and it's shaping up quite nicely. In goal and at the other end with the striker, there are areas of interest. Would you still hope or expect to have new personnel in those areas?",
      "\"To hope is a strong word. We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see. But I'm really happy. And I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers, even Tom is linear (think he means leaner), he's a different goalkeeper. Altay [Bayindir] did really well and Andre Onana is going to be better like the other guys that are getting better this year. \"",
      "Ruben, the club have had a lot of managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left. There have been a lot of plans and ambitions, then the team's results get problematic, the ownership lose the nerve and they change the manager. A lot of fans are sick of seeing that and they accept that there might be some hard days to come, but they have to see this through. How confident are you that even if there are challenges this season, the club realise they can't keep doing what it's done before? They have to back you long term.",
      "\"I always felt that. In some moments in the last season, I was more concerned about me than them. They always show the support. And if you try to remember one team, one big team, massive team, that lost so many games and the manager kept their job, you will not find it. So that shows more than words that they support me. I think it's really important to say to the fans that this is a club thing. Of course the manager is really important, but all this idea of the culture, how we want to buy players, what kind of players we want, is a club thing. In the meetings with Bryan, with Cunha, we said that. Don't go to a club because of the manager. Go because of the idea of the club. And they are here because of the idea of the club. \"",
      "On Sir Jim Ratcllffe, he spoke very enthusiastically about you. He said 'I like Ruben, he tells me to “f**k off”'. Can you just talk about how often you two speak? Do you message him a lot? You seem to have a very frank and honest relationship.",
      "\"We speak on the phone, he sends me messages, he sends me gifs. You call it gifs? Joking. So we have this kind of relationship. I think it's really easy to deal with Jim. Easy in the sense that if you know your stuff, if you know how to explain any decision, you'll be fine with him. If you try to use some bullshit in big words with him, he's going to knock you. So for me it's really easy. I will say whatever I need to say with, of course, a lot of respect, like with everybody, I know that he's the owner of the club, I know my place. But when I need to say something, I will say it naturally. With no bullshit - I can say that - with no bullshit, I'm not around the subject, I'm really direct. I think it's something that he likes a lot.\"",
      "You seem as sure in your own mind about what you wanted to do as you ever did, you've been quite clear since you came to the club. What you wanted to do. Has that ever changed?",
      "\"Not because I believe, but I changed so many things during my short career as a manager. When I see a different thing that works, I will use it. I copy so many things about other managers, the way they play, warm-ups. I stole warm-ups. So I'm not so stubborn, but I truly believe that to be a really strong team, we need to have a base. When the base is okay, we will start doing different things. I truly believe in that, it's a process. I'm not the coach, I'm not the coach. And I said that in the interview. I'm not the coach that is going to try, in that case, to survive, to put an idea that is not mine. Since day one, it's the only way I know what to do. Let's build the base, are we going to suffer? Yes.\"",
      "When you talk about midfielders and a lack of pace, is that a general fitness thing? Or is that a personal thing?",
      "\"Of course there are players that are not going to have a bigger pace. It's something that you cannot change. But if you look at the same players in these games, the pace is different. That is my feeling. I think it's the time to train. That I think is clear. I think even the certainty of the movements can help a player to be faster. If you are thinking, I jump, I don't jump. We train, when they need to jump, they already know. So I start sooner. Sometimes it's one meter. Sometimes it's one second. And that is something that the tactical aspect and the physical aspect are together. \"",
      "Like Kobbie Mainoo with the interception for the pass for Bruno to score against West Ham?",
      "\"Mainoo, with those feet, playing the ball, if he finds the right pace, playing like every time I give the ball, I find a new solution. Every time the guy is running back, I can follow the guy because he can. He's going to be faster. \"",
      "You said you want to be here for the long term. You said 20 years. You know, we all know, the average lifespan of a manager is two or three years now. With the exception of Pep, Klopp, Fergie and Wenger before. What makes you confident that you can stay here long term?",
      "\"One of the things is the experience that I had. I know that it's different. But if you look, Sporting was the same thing. They said that in three months I'm out. They said that I had 3% chance of winning one title with Sporting. It was the same thing. I know that the pressure is different. But I truly believe on that and I don't like to change club. I like to bond with people and carry on. So, I took, I don't say five years because I was not thinking about leaving during the five years but the last years I was waiting for the right club. I know it sounds crazy. But I chose this club. But I had the feeling. So, I think I'm not going to have that feeling of I need to experience pain. I just want to bond, to be part of it. Until I can, I will stay here.\"",
      "Just finally, you've made some big decisions. With Alejandro, it seemed like there was a willingness from your side and his side to make it work. And you praised him a lot. You must feel it's a pity that it's not worked out?",
      "I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.”",

      "Manchester United and Everton face off in a highly anticipated Premier League Summer Series clash as both clubs continue their preparations for the 2025/26 season. The Red Devils are eager to build momentum after a poor 2024/25 campaign, with new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo looking to make their mark.",
      "Everton, meanwhile, are entering a new era as they gear up for their debut season at the state-of-the-art Hill Dickinson Stadium. However, their pre-season has got off to a rocky start with a heavy 3-0 defeat to Brighton on Day 1 of the Summer Series, and a 2-1 defeat to West Ham on Day 2.",
      "The friendly between Manchester United and Everton is being held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, USA, with a capacity of 82,500. The match kicks off at 7pm local time on Saturday, July 26, which translates to 12am UK time on Sunday, July 27.",
      "Alternatively, NOW TV passes are available for non-subscribers. MUTV will also broadcast the game live for subscribers, accessible via Sky (channel 418) or Virgin Media (channel 526). For US viewers, the match will be shown on NBC Sports.",
      "Summer arrivals Cunha and Mbeumo are expected to be involved for United, with Ruben Amorim's new-look attack beginning to take shape. While Cunha has already featured heavily for the club this summer, Mbeumo has been left out of their initial pre-season games to allow him to build some fitness up, and could make his official bow against Everton.",
      "As for the Toffees, summer signings Carlos Alcaraz, Thierno Barry and Mark Travers - all of whom have made their debuts - are expected to be given run outs. However, the fixture may come a little too early for the club's latest capture, Adam Aznou, whose move from Bayern Munich was confirmed on Tuesday.",
      "After facing Everton, United will head back to the UK for their final pre-season game: a clash with Fiorentina at Old Trafford. The match will take place on Saturday, August 9 ahead of their Premier League opener against Arsenal eight days later.",
      "Like United, David Moyes' men are set to travel back to England after the game, with a final pre-season tie with Roma to come. The game will take place on August 9 at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, marking the Everton senior team's first ever fixture there.",
      "The Toffees then kick off their Premier League campaign against newly-promoted Leeds United on August 18, before hosting Brighton on Merseyside on August 24 in what will be the first competitive match at their new ground.",

      "Kadeem Harris' own goal had given the away side the lead in the eighth minute before he made up for his gaffe by getting Neville's men level moments later.",
      "But Crewe quickly took control of the game just before the half time interval as Conor Thomas netted a brace in the space of a few minutes.",
      "Salford could not stage a fight back after the break and Neville was seen looking downbeat in the stands as he was pictured inside the directors' box holding up a hand against the window.",
      "And Crewe couldn't resist teasing the former England defender as they posted the picture of Neville holding up his hand, showing five fingers, and writing: \"Nah it was three Gary.\"",
      "The cheeky post went down a hit with football fans on Twitter as one joined in with the fun, adding: \"Clearly saying it should have been five by half time.\"",
      "Another wrote: \"Counting how many places off the bottom of the league they are,\" as a third said: \"It should have been how many Gary?\"",
      "Neville has been one of the owners of Salford since 2014, agreeing to purchase the club alongside fellow Class of 92 members David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and brother Phil - as well as businessman Peter Lim.",
      "However, Neville acquired Lim's stake in the club in 2024 and this year it was announced that only Neville and Beckham remained shareholders out of the Class of 92 legends following a takeover by a new ownership group.",

      "Amorim is hoping for a clean slate in the 2025-26 season as he looks to turn the club's fortunes around following a disastrous last campaign that saw them finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon boss came under fire after failing to stop the rot after making their worst ever start to a league season under Erik ten Hag, who was sacked last October.",
      "Amorim has attempted to overhaul his squad after sending Marcus Rashford out on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have also been told to find new clubs. Christian Eriksen, Viktor Lindelof and Jonny Evans were released.",
      "He has started his rebuild by signing two high-profile players in forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who arrived for £63.5m and £71m respectively, but Amorim is not happy to stop there as he also looks to bring in Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "And the manager has also outlined plans for a leadership group who he hopes can give the team more stability this season - after watching the team fall apart and succumb to 17 league defeats in 2024-25.",
      "\"We have a leadership group now,\" Amorim said during a wide-ranging interview. \"It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group.",
      "\"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible.

If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you - and I will show you in front of everybody. So I'm always on top. But in one sense I don't expect or need to do anything, because they will push each other. But if you train badly one time, I will show you the image. I will not speak with you, just speak. I will show everything.\"",
      "In the same interview, Amorim revealed he wanted to stay at United for 20 years and said he was confident of bringing the good times back to the club - but also admitted he feared going to games last season knowing knowing his side could lose games.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, it's not how I returned to my house after the games but how I left to go to the games,\" he said. \"All the struggles that we had in the games, I feel it before the games.

      "It led Amorim to question whether he was good enough to lead United and he even offered to quit with no compensation if the club felt that was right. But United stood by Amorim, who has carried on the task of reviving the fallen giants, after admitting he went into games last season fearing the worst.",
      "“To tell you the truth, it was not how I returned to my house after the games,” said Amorim, during a break from United's US tour. “It was how I left to go to the games, because I felt that sometimes we would struggle.",
      "“All the struggles that we had in the games, I could feel it before, so that was the hardest part - to go to the games and know that we were not going to be competitive, how we should be. That was the hardest part.",
      "“When I returned, I just looked to my family and tried to think about different things. But if you want to know the most difficult moment, it was before the games, because I knew that we will struggle in specific games.",
      "“I had the feeling during the season that I was so frustrated. I could do nothing, I acknowledged that, so I had to wait.",
      "“Being manager of Manchester United was like going to a fight with my hands like this [down by his side]. So that was the frustration.",

      "Managing United may be one of the most high-pressure jobs in world football, but Amorim has a healthy sense of perspective when it comes to his role. “This is not the moment I felt the most pressure in my life,” said Amorim. “I had a career as a player and I finished really soon because of injuries.",

      "Ruben Amorim has opened up on his “no bull****” relationship with Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Amorim revealed he talks and messages Ratcliffe on a regular basis and the pair get on because they share the same straight-talking approach.",
      "“We speak on the phone, he sends me messages, he sends me GIFs,” said Amorim. “You call it GIFs? Like joking. So we have this kind of relationship.",
      "“I think it's really easy to deal with Jim. Easy in the sense that if you know your stuff, if you know how to explain any decision, you'll be fine with him.",
      "“If you try to use some bull**** in big words with him, he's going to knock you. So for me it's really easy. I will say whatever I need to say with, of course, a lot of respect, like with everybody.",
      "“I know that he's the owner of the club, I know my place. But when I need to say something, I will say it naturally, with no bull****. I can say that - with no bull****. I'm not around the subject, I'm really direct and I think it's something that he likes a lot.”",
      "Amorim's claim about Ratcliffe comes amid a lofty claim by the Portuguese coach. He has suggested that with the backing of the INEOS supremo, as well as other Red Devils chiefs, he can restore the club at the top of the English game.",
      "He said: “I have no doubts, because there are some things that you cannot buy and that this club has. The pedigree, the history, the fans. We have that.",
      "“I think that is clear. Then the money. We have money. We have money without the Champions League. So we have money and we'll have more money in the future. We're doing everything.",
      "Where will Man United finish next season? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“You talk with Omar [Berrada, chief executive] and all these guys, they are making all the strategy to have more money in the future. So that will not be a problem.",
      "“Then I think it's clearly the culture. If we have a different culture, with all of that, with all of the pedigree, the money, all of these things, we can return to our place - that is clear.”",
      "Amorim will continue his preparations for the new season this weekend as United take on Everton in the USA. They then face a final pre-season game against Fiorentina ahead of their season opener against Arsenal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said he has no hard feelings over Alejandro Garnacho's desire to leave Old Trafford for a new challenge.",
      "Winger Garnacho fell out with Amorim after he was dropped for the Europa League final, which United lost 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the defeat, Garnacho criticised Amorim's decision and said he would consider his future over the summer.",
      "Amorim responded by telling £40million-rated Garnacho he was not part of his future plans and left him off United's US tour, with several other players who want out of the club.",
      "But Amorim said the best solution was for United and Garnacho to part ways, given the 20-year-old clearly wants to play elsewhere.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” said Amorim. \"But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that.",
      "\"So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge.",
      "\"So we try to make everything OK for all parties. To the club, to the coach and to the player. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Garnacho wants to join Chelsea, who have enquired about him, while there has also been interest from Aston Villa and Serie A side Napoli.",
      "The Argentine is not the only player to have fallen out of favour with Amorim after Marcus Rashford also disagreed with the coach last season before being sent on loan to Aston Villa. He's since secured a loan move to Barcelona.",
      "Garnacho is now one of four players in the group known as the \"bomb squad\" - United outcasts who have been excluded from the US pre-season tour as they look for new clubs - including Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",

      "Manchester United's summer recruit, Matheus Cunha, picked the Red Devils over Newcastle despite the Magpies having Champions League football this season, while Ruben Amorim's men are going without. Newcastle were heavily interested in bringing the tricky Wolves forward to the North East off the back of his impressive performances last year.",
      "Alongside the added incentive of being able to line up alongside his compatriots, Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton, the Brazilian was also said to be on the hunt for Champions League football at his next club, something Newcastle were able to provide.",
      "However, after qualifying on the final day of the campaign, which is set to guarantee the club £32million, Newcastle were rebuffed by the 26-year-old, despite being told a deal to secure Cunha hinged on European participation.",
      "Cunha stunned Toon officials by picking United instead. United wrapped up the deal for £62.5m despite Amorim's team finishing 15th last season and missing out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Reports suggested that the Red Devils were able to offer higher wages to Cunha, while the player himself later claimed United were indeed the team he supported as a youngster.",
      "\"It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player,\" he said after his signing was confirmed. \"Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.\"",
      "The overall maximum prize money for a participant in the Champions League is £137m, with Newcastle at least guaranteed £32m, meaning the Magpies were expecting a thrilling summer of deals. Yet Newcastle's transfer activity has been middling at best so far.",
      "Despite signing Anthony Elanga for £55m from Nottingahm Forest and securing Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan, Howe has seen a series of top targets elect to play their football elsewhere for this upcoming season. While Cunha headed to Manchester, another target, in the form of French striker Hugo Ekitike, joined Liverpool from Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford, who was eyed by Howe, later signed for Manchester City. Both Ipswich's Liam Delap and Brighton's Joao Pedro, who were fancied by Newcastle, then joined Chelsea, while former Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo also chose United over Newcastle.",
      "A move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is currently in the works, with Newcastle having had a £65.5m offer, with 4m in add-ons, rejected for the player. Fears are now rife at St James' Park that United will swoop in and steal the towering Slovenian forward, with Amorim holding a firm interest in the striker. If that were to happen, Sesko would be the third player this window to pick United over Newcastle.",
      "Matters have been compounded for Newcastle this summer after Liverpool lodged a £110m offer for superstar striker Alexander Isak. The Swedish star has made it clear he wishes to explore opportunities away from St James' Park but the club are determined to fight to keep him.",
      "Speaking about the situation, Howe said: \"I think from my situation, I am very much removed from everything that is happening back home.",
      "\"I was made aware there was a bid yesterday. That bid was turned down before I heard about it. There are people back in England dealing with the situation. I really don’t know what is going to happen next, but from our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.\"",

      "They are not attractions that merit plinths in the club museum or will get supporters flocking to the Old Trafford tour. United did not beat Everton in Atlanta but this has been one of their most buoyant tours in years.",
      "This was the least accomplished of United's performances in the States. The only post-match activity Ruben Amorim must have relished would have been the on-pitch training session as opposed to a trophy presentation.",
      "Even without a new No.9, United have rallied eight goals across three games. They have avoided casualties in defence, a department usually hit by injury crises, but their midfield is thin.",
      "In this squad with a surfeit of No.10s, another popped up with a goal. Mason Mount's goal evoked memories of his tie-killing strike against Athletic Bilbao in May. That goal and cameo effectively earned Mount a promotion to the starting XI for the Europa League final. He is now even more up against it to regain a starting status.",
      "A commentator familiar to American soccer audiences announced the line-ups as if it were a wrestling event. In case anybody could not hear him, the 360-degree giant screen listed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the same United line-up together for the first time.",
      "United's warm-ups consist of defence-versus-attack drills and their set-up in the magnificent Mercedes-Benz Stadium confirmed Cunha would be the centre forward. He was the only one not to hit his cue in the fifth minute when played in by Amad.",
      "The most striking sequence in the move were Mbeumo's two touches - his first two in a United shirt. It advanced the attack and enabled Bruno Fernandes to accelerate it. Mbeumo's prompt play drew 'ooh's from a starstruck crowd. Then he generated a round of applause following a canny dribble out of defence in the 33rd minute.",
      "Mbeumo was on the right of the two playmakers but popped up on the left wing. His first time through-ball for Amad to win United's penalty was exemplary.",
      "That opening was fashioned by Cunha, Fernandes and Mbeumo all combining from deep. Mbeumo's awareness of teammates' positioning was so natural that it belied the fact that this was his first appearance for United. The trio clicked quickly.",
      "Amorim never entertained the prospect of playing a strikerless system in the final weeks of last season when it was worth trialling amid Hojlund's impotence. He has had a change of heart following £133.5million worth of investment in the attack.",
      "Amad, a winger-cum-playmaker, is one of three players to have started all three tour matches. As starry as Cunha, Mbeumo and Fernandes are, the signing driven by John Murtough remains one of the most integral in Amorim's side. Amad has played wide right and as one of the two 10s and is emerging as a hidden asset with his lung-bursting sprints on the defender's blindside.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "As game as Cunha is, there were flickers of frustration from him as he operated as the centre forward. It is in his and United's interests that he does not remain there for most of the competitive season, though he is possibly more suitable than a Slovenian playing for the seventh-placed side in the Bundesliga. Cunha still rallied to press and embark into a rousing sprint.",
      "The incumbent striker, Rasmus Hojlund, feels he is being forced out at United and emerged to vent again. Hojlund kicked the post after Patrick Dorgu kicked the ball at goal rather than across the goal.",
      "United still have issues further back. Manuel Ugarte went from domineering against West Ham to dominated by Everton. He erred for Iliman Ndiyaye's equaliser by attempting to dribble the ball out of United's third.",
      "Everton sensed Ugarte's vulnerability and they were quicker to press him in the second half. Ugarte pleaded with the referee for extra protection, which merely fuelled Everton whenever he next had the ball. He attempted to match them and fouled Ndiyaye overzealously.",
      "Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Toby Collyer is not a midfield quartet that is going to cut it over the course of a season. Even without European football. United intend to loan out Collyer and Casemiro has been omitted from the new six-man leadership group, having been a member of the eight-man team under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Mainoo was replaced by Mount and Fernandes dropped back into midfield. That worked a treat when Fernandes shifted the ball inside for Mount to leather the ball past Jordan Pickford.",
      "You could play Fernandes in goal instead of the errant Altay Bayindir and he would still be the most influential player in the United shirt. He is papering over the cracks in midfield now, though he erred for both of Everton's equalisers. Fernandes was squaring up to Ndiyaye, having kicked out at him, when Amad's attempted clearance deflected in off the luckless Ayden Heaven.",
      "Fernandes does at least have a new cast list to ease the burden on him. And perhaps possibly win the actual Premier League trophy in the future.",

      "Cunha",
      "Some decent connections. 6",
      "The half-time whistle goes at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium and it is 1-1 at the break",
      "Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring via the penalty spot with 19 minutes on the clock, but Everton responded shortly before half-time through Iliman Ndiaye.",
      "Fernandes switched off momentarily there and it was enough. Ugarte didn't cover himself in glory trying to dribble out of the United third there and Everton were ruthless with one touch to cross and one touch to finish.",
      "Everton have been competitive and had some moments before they equalised. United have not had as much control as they did in the first halves against Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Everton are back on terms. Ugarte loses the ball, a cross goes to the back post and Ndiaye fires a smart finish past Bayindir.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes in and Mbeumo can be pleased with his maiden appearance for United. He has used the ball impressively, taken up impressive positions and had two or three goalscoring opportunities.",
      "Cunha has shown the odd flicker of frustration. He's done okay but this isn't his role and it shouldn't be going forward.",
      "Mbeumo is somehow denied a debut goal after attempting to gobble up the rebound after Fernandes was denied by Pickford.",
      "The Cameroonian has been very lively.",
      "Mbeumo has made a really positive start. His awareness of teammates has been excellent and he is clicking quickly with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Amorim really ought to have trialled a strikerless system in April or May but evidently didn't feel he had the tools at his disposal. It is different now after United invested £133.5m in the squad and they have been slick so far."

      "Ruben Amorim has established new rules for Manchester United players to abide by this season.",
      "Amorim has settled on a softer form of discipline than permanent predecessor Erik ten Hag, though he has reiterated the importance of punctual timekeeping.",
      "Club sources say there are defined rules and codes of conduct now, with players encouraged to sign autographs and pose for photographs with supporters, though former executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward advocated such humility as far back as 2019.",
      "United have encountered issues with a number of high-profile players in recent years. Jadon Sancho confessed while he was at Borussia Dortmund he had to improve his timekeeping and it was also an issue at United.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not play during the 2022 pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia after he was late for a meeting and Marcus Rashford was dropped for the New Year's Eve fixture at Wolves later that year following his late arrival for a pre-match team meeting. Rashford came on at half-time to score the winning goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Rashford and Garnacho from the squad for the Manchester derby at City in December over their attitude in the 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen three days earlier. Rashford has not played for United since and Garnacho is expected to be sold before the end of the transfer window.",
      "After finishing 15th and trophyless last season, Amorim is striving to raise the standards at United and believes the clubs have improved their medical department and nutrition. He stressed that he will always be \"on top\" of the players and if they train poorly he will show them video evidence in front of their teammates.",
      "\"I think it's really important, especially when you are losing,\" Amorim said of the changes he has made. \"Sometimes you have that feeling that we are losing, let's change a little bit the standards just for them to be with me. I didn't feel that last season and they also saw that.",
      "\"So they understand that when I say one thing, I will do it. That is really important. And I think the change of culture is more a club thing than a manager thing. I cannot do everything by myself.",
      "\"But I think we improved in every department: medical department, nutrition, we have a new chef, we have new rules. We have rules, and the rules are not to treat the players as babies. They have sons. I treat them as a man, but they have rules now.",
      "\"And that can change the way you train. If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you. And I show you in front of everybody. So I'm always on top.",
      "\"I will expect to be in one phase, that I don't need to do anything. Because they will push each other. But in the moment, if you train one time bad, I will show you the image. I will not speak with you, just speak. I will show everything.",
      "\"So that really requires a lot of energy.\"",

      "\"At the moment I am told that there is nothing concrete in it,\" he said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"Also because, the first point is Barca don't want to sell Fermin Lopez.",

      "Manchester United open the doors to their new first team building at Carrington on Friday. We shall see whether they have replicated the Chicago Fire's press conference room set-up.",
      "At the Fire's plush Endeavor Health Performance Center, the proximity of the media room is canny, situated to the right of reception. Even one of the MLS's consistently low-ranking teams who share their name with a TV series are quick to show the media to the door.",
      "Upon our arrival on Friday, we gave our name at reception and obtained a lanyard. Then we were requested to wait in that room while Ruben Amorim completed another media engagement on camera. \"Arrange it however you want,\" the United press officer breezily suggested.",
      "Chairs were laid out in orderly rows, as is custom for a press conference. Settling with a press conference-style format would have ensured Amorim had a more comfortable and cushioned seat on the dais but this was a more intimate setting and his first interview sans cameras.",
      "Forming a circle seemed sensible. This worked with Erik ten Hag at AAMI Park in Melbourne in 2022. Our expectations for that sit-down were low, going off his succinct press conference unveiling at Old Trafford. Ten Hag turned out to be terrific value.",
      "He was undeniably more relaxed without cameras present. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer quipped how much he enjoyed the sit-down in Perth on his only pre-season tour in 2019 as the only devices visible were dictaphones.",
      "Myself and a colleague did a careful head count in the Chicago press room: eight journalists and one manager. So we assembled the correct number of chairs and awaited Amorim's arrival.",
      "He strode in around ten minutes later, flanked by three officials from the communications department and a security staff member. Amorim was in his tour training regalia: tight black tracksuit bottoms and a purple Adidas training shirt. The initials 'RA' are even affixed to Amorim's box-fresh white trainers.",
      "There was the familiar, \"Hi guys\" when Amorim entered and he shook hands with everyone. We expressed gratitude for him giving up his time. Amorim cheerfully assured us it was \"a pleasure\". That was a first with a United manager.",
      "At AAMI Park, we had 25 minutes with Ten Hag. We had 18 with Amorim. But you do not need 20 minutes with Amorim.",
      "One of the longest-serving stalwarts of the Manchester pack insisted it was the best of all of the managerial sit-downs he had been present for. That dates back to Sir Alex Ferguson's era.",
      "One could have feasibly written up lines well into double figures:",
      "Our interview was pooled with the broadcasters' chat with Amorim, when he candidly admitted he dreaded travelling to certain games last season and was targeting a 20-year stint managing United. More work.",
      "That warmth that Amorim exudes is as hot as the Chicago weather. He stressed on the post-season tour he did not feel the need to disconnect in the close season and his mood is as sunny as it was during those torturous weeks last season. That is some going when United literally could not string two Premier League wins together and went eight league fixtures without victory in April and May.",
      "Once the questions were underway, the first word Amorim used was \"confident\". Amorim feels emboldened by the backing he has received from the United hierarchy and the harmony he has restored during pre-season has been well received by the players. A dressing room source said there is a \"much better feel\" in the happy camp.",
      "It was such an optimistic chat that no members of the bomb squad were mentioned until the final question. Once Amorim had said his piece, he expressed his gratitude and was in such a chipper mood he bade farewell by clasping hands until one of the more traditional hacks caused him to switch to a handshake.",
      "Amorim headed out of the door, flanked by United staff. The doors will soon be reopening at Carrington.",

      "United completed the £71million signing of Mbeumo from Brentford two weeks ago but he did not figure in their first two tour matches against West Ham United in New Jersey and Bournemouth in Chicago as he was behind in pre-season training.",
      "Mbeumo played for 45 minutes against Everton and impressed with his role in two attacking sequences, one of them eventually leading to the penalty that Bruno Fernandes converted.",
      "Amorim played Mbeumo alongside Fernandes as one of the two No.10s in his 3-4-2-1 system, with fellow summer signing Matheus Cunha picked as the false nine.",
      "\"I think he played well,\" Amorim said of Mbeumo. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements. But I think the first touch, the way he connects with one touch, opened a lot of space.",

      "The Everton game was the least accomplished of United's three performances in the United States and Amorim suggested it would reinforce their focus ahead of returning to England.",
      "\"I think we struggled today a little bit,\" Amorim acknowledged. \"So it's just that, the feeling of not performing like we're supposed to do, but it was okay. I think it has to do with the long balls and then second balls, but sometimes even with different players you struggle. You see all the games from Everton, even different midfielders suffer with this kind of game.",
      "\"They break the team with two centre backs changing possession and then they kick the ball and then the second ball. We struggle a little bit with that, not just the second balls, but the first balls. We struggle in the build-up, but we create chances and that is really important to win any match.",
      "\"You can perform, I don't like to say bad, but we can struggle a little bit in the game, but if you create chances you can win even that kind of game.",
      "\"If you play well, they will say that we play really well, something on the opposite side. It's the same thing, so we need to be really consistent. We already knew that we had two weeks, this will not change in two weeks, but we are better.",
      "\"Even in this game we create chances and that is really important. But of course, I think it's the perfect feeling to go back to Carrington. I think the momentum of the tour was perfect.",

      "In a bid to try and correct last season's wrongs, United have spent north of £130million in the transfer market so far, bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo - who made his first appearance for the club in Sunday night's 2-2 draw with Everton in the United States - and Diego Leon.",
      "Although Berrada has acknowledged new additions will strengthen United's chances of making progress in 2025/26, he has also hailed the improvement in the mood around the club, praising the work that has been done by the likes of head coach Ruben Amorim and football director Jason Wilcox.",
      "Berrada, speaking ahead of the draw with Everton, told MUTV: \"The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level.",

      "On United's plans to continue strengthening the squad ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1, Berrada added: \"We have to do a lot of multitasking.",

      "United played with a sense of purpose, producing a really encouraging performance. Although pre-season caveats have to be accounted for, their performance was energetic, vibrant and really encouraging.",
      "The tempo they set allowed them to move the ball with speed and a sense of conviction. One of the biggest criticisms they have faced in recent years has been for how uninspiring they have been to watch.",
      "Clearly adapting and becoming more and more familiar with Ruben Amorim's system, United's improved collective performances have raised the levels of several individuals. Patrick Dorgu, who arrived from Lecce in February, was particularly impressive against the Cherries, contributing a goal and an assist.",
      "With just two pre-season friendlies remaining, Amorim's team selections for the clashes with Everton and Fiorentina could provide a firm indication of the starting XI he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",

Some positions have greater strength in depth than others, but that does not necessarily mean there isn't an obvious candidate to occupy top spot in the pecking order.",

      "In the wing-back department, Amad and Dorgu were both on target against Bournemouth. The latter has been superb in the opening two games of the tour and was involved in both of United's first half goals against the Cherries.",
      "Amorim wants his wing-backs to operate as wingers and occupy attacking positions. Dorgu did exactly that against Bournemouth and West Ham, pushing high up the pitch.",
      "Amad started as the right-sided No.10 against Bournemouth, but his starting position could change depending on what Amorim considers as Mbeumo's best position. The Cameroonian could feature for the first time this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was not on the scoresheet against Bournemouth, but his performance was just as influential. He regularly got on the ball in the centre of midfield and combined with Mason Mount and Amad in the No.10 berths.",
      "The Portuguese international is United's best player by some distance and will be a shoo-in for however long he remains at Old Trafford, meaning he could afford to have a dire pre-season and still make the team for the first competitive game of the season. His influence and importance is unrivalled.",
      "Fernandes linked up brilliantly with Cunha against West Ham and they will be hoping to develop a fruitful bond this season. The Brazilian has arrived from Wolves for £62.5million and has quickly demonstrated the sort of qualities he will bring to Old Trafford.",
      "His running power, technical ability and creativity levels inside the final third make him a guaranteed starter. He is also a natural fit for the left-sided No.10 spot.",

      "Bailly lasted merely three months at Besiktas before his deal was cancelled. He returned to Villarreal but parted ways with the Spanish side when his contract expired last month.",
      "Whilst seeking fresh employment, he has been proposed to Serie A outfits Cagliari and Cremonese, according to Calciomercato. However, both clubs have declined the opportunity to recruit the former United defender due to his salary expectations, believed to be around £860,000 for the campaign.",
      "Recent years have represented quite the decline for Bailly, who appeared destined for greatness when he joined Mourinho at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, the duo maintain a close bond as Bailly revealed the chat he had after contacting the renowned manager following his dismissal at Tottenham.",
      "\"When he [Mourinho] was sacked from Tottenham I sent him a message and when he signed for Roma I spoke to him on the phone,\" Bailly told The Times. \"We had a few laughs. He's a coach I've always been good with. Hopefully, we'll meet in the future.\"",

      "After joining Barcelona on loan, Marcus Rashford remains tight-lipped about a potential permanent move from Manchester United. The forward has moved to Catalonia for the forthcoming season after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford's temporary switch to Barca provides the reigning champions of La Liga an opportunity to secure his services for £30million. This sum is significantly less than Rashford's value just a few seasons ago, before his standing took a hit at Old Trafford. The Spanish side are also covering his salary, saving United in the region of £12million over the course of the year.",
      "However, there are uncertainties surrounding Barcelona's financial health and whether Rashford will be registered in time for the season's kick-off. La Liga's financial fair play regulations have recently caused problems for the club, with the eligibility of Dani Olmo and Pau Victor being questioned last season.",
      "Spanish star Olmo even missed some game time last season while Barcelona sought approval over their salary cap issues. Yet when asked about any potential stumbling blocks, having already made a couple of pre-season appearances for his new team, Rashford responded nonchalantly.",
      "\"I'm not worried,\" he told Catalan newspaper Sport (via The Mirror), addressing his registration concerns. \"It's something the club needs to resolve, and I trust they will. I'm focused on training and being ready for the start of the competition.\"",
      "Rashford then clarified his stance on a permanent departure from United, emphasising he simply wants to \"enjoy the moment\" rather than think too far ahead. The 27-year-old made his Barcelona bow in a 3-1 friendly triumph against Japanese side Vissel Kobe at the end of July.",
      "Yet the cameo seemed to go awry. The England star entered as a substitute, only to be hauled off again after 30 minutes. The episode was portrayed as rather awkward for the player, who spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Nevertheless, new manager Hansi Flick was swift to reject any suggestions of embarrassment or shame. And he maintained the choice was purely to manage the player's fitness levels.",
      "\"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball,\" said the German after that match. \"He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford excelled on loan under Unai Emery and assisted Villa in making a historic run in the Champions League. He should be back among Europe's elite this coming season, though the same cannot be said for parent club United after they missed out on continental qualification altogether.",
      "It's also clear Rashford is prioritising his new team's requirements ahead of any personal ambitions. And he believes his capability to contribute from various areas of the pitch puts him in good stead.",
      "\"I can play in different positions and score goals from any of them,\" he said. \"It's about creating chances from different areas and taking advantage of them.\"",
      "Such an approach could well persuade Barcelona to secure his services on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, the United academy graduate faces a considerable journey to demonstrate that he merits the move, having copped criticism from pundits and United icons alike for not 'deserving' the transfer to Spain.",

      "Manchester United are confident of financing a deal for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko before selling any members of their 'bomb squad'.",
      "United have opened discussions to sign Sesko, 22, in a deal that could cost up to £79million. Newcastle United are resigned to Sesko joining United, having lined up the Slovenia international as a potential replacement for Alexander Isak if he joins Liverpool.",
      "Newcastle have suggested United are at an advanced stage to sign Sesko, though club sources have denied that.",
      "United figures believe they have extra headroom to do a deal for a striker without any imminent sales following the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford. Barcelona are covering Rashford's salary in full, which has saved United around £14m.",
      "The club raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses following transfers involving academy players Anthony Elanga, Alvaro Carreras and Maxi Oyedele, as well as £5m from the penalty fee Chelsea paid to not buy Jadon Sancho.",
      "United have made additional savings following a frugal winter transfer window in which they signed Patrick Dorgu for an up-front fee of £25m and loaned out Rashford and Antony, with the majority of their salaries covered by Aston Villa and Real Betis.",
      "The signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were structured with instalments, so although United have committed to investing £133.5m in the pair, the cost is spread over a period of time.",
      "United's profitability and sustainability position has improved following a second round of redundancies in as many years. United have slashed their workforce by roughly a third since co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority stake was ratified in February 2024.",
      "The next three-year PSR cycle will also omit the extravagant signings of Casemiro and Antony, bought for a combined fee rising to £156.3m in August 2022.",
      "United still intend to sell 'bomb squad' members Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia but expect there to be movement nearer the September 1 transfer deadline.",
      "Chelsea are interested in Garnacho, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund have held informal discussions about a deal for Sancho and Malacia has been linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League.",

      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim replied when asked if he hoped to have a new striker and a new 'keeper. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.",
      "\"But I'm really happy. And I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers. Even Tom (Heaton) is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper. Altay (Bayindir) did really well and Onana is going to be better like the other guys that are getting better this year.\"",

      "The striker merry-go-round has Newcastle chasing Benjamin Sesko and PIF pals Al-Hilal setting Liverpool up to sign Alexander Isak by signing Darwin Nunez.",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Aleksandar Mitrovic – Al-Hilal to the Premier League\nFour trophies and 68 goals in 79 games across two seasons might be all she wrote for Mitrovic in Saudi, as Al-Hilal’s relentless pursuit for a new striker as demanded by Simone Inzaghi is likely to see the Serbian forced out of the picture. A Premier League return is on the cards with Manchester United among those mentioned.",
      "",
      "19) Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Borussia Dortmund\nThe Gunners man is on Dortmund’s list of winger targets, with Jadon Sancho also under consideration. Arsenal could reinvest some of the money into Rodrygo, which means their supporters are bang up for this.",
      "",
      "18) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nFootball Insider’s Mick Brown is hearing things again, folks. Guehi to Liverpool could accelerate following Luis Diaz’s transfer to Bayern, apparently. The Crystal Palace captain’s “heart is set” on a move to Anfield, says the ex-Manchester United chief scout, who remains very well-connected within the game. FI’s words, not ours.",

      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",
      "",
      "16) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "14) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "12) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to AC Milan\nAn article from Gianluca Di Marzio stated that Nunez is Milan’s ‘first choice’, with Rasmus Hojlund, Dusan Vlahovic and Kalimuendo the back-up options. It looks like being Italy or the Middle East for Captain Chaos…",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t. United are now behind their league rivals in the race for Sesko.",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "7) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal is dropping down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nNewcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters but a Magpies bid is in. Let’s see whether or not Leipzig reject it and if the Red Devils react…",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool rejected an offer of around £70m from Al-Hilal for Nunez in January and will not delude themselves into thinking a summer sale could generate nearly as much. But another piece in their Isak puzzle could fall into place thanks to the Magpies’ owners. PIF want to give the Saudi Pro League runners-up a shiny new centre-forward and Nunez has been earmarked as that man, with the Uruguayan described as ‘receptive’ to that interest ahead of bidding.",
      "",
      "3) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Armando Broja – Chelsea to Burnley\nA ‘Here we go’ out of nowhere was delivered on Friday night. It will be a permanent move for Broja.",
      "",
      "1) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs got the ‘Here we go’ on Thursday night and has completed his medical. It’s a loan for Palhinha, with an option to buy for 30 million euros.",

      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £134.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

This example of this unacceptably frequent misstep upsets more than most, given the otherwise 10/10 shirt they’ve decided to slightly spoil for simply no good reason.",

      "6. Manchester United away\nFair play, giving both Arsenal and Liverpool away/third kits this season that look very Man United away kit and then giving Man United an away kit that is better than both anyway is quite a good bit.",
      "We like this one a lot, especially for the clever use of the ‘snowflake’ imprint. It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",
      "But if it works, it works. And what they’ve done for United here that maybe isn’t quite so true of the (nevertheless strikingly excellent) Arsenal away kit is do something new and different with it. In this case that means making it all massive.",

      "It’s not far off a direct facsimile of the 2001-03 Leeds kit, but none the worse for that. The yellow details are all spot on, and the yellow-white-yellow for the adidas stripes is absolutely the correct choice as well.",

Very bold, and it turns out very correct. Because this is excellent. Lovely shield on there, as in the 93-95 umbro kit to which this doesn’t so much subtly nod as hold up great big neon arrows with flashing signs on them saying “Remember when Eric sorted out that wrong’un lol”.",

      "The self-stripe is subtly done, with little Red Devil logos hidden in there rather nicely. We’re very greedy and would very much have liked those to instead have been silhouettes of Cantona mid-kick, but we do also understand why such an obviously correct idea is in the real world outside our head a non-starter.

There’s something just nice and wholesome anyway in the way one of the two football kit giants is willing to acknowledge the work of the other and, while most would correctly agree that adidas are the correct company to make Arsenal kits – we will not and cannot elaborate, it’s just fact – Nike certainly made some cult classics.",

      "It is so, so much better than last year’s away kit when, instead of drawing inspiration from a beloved Arsenal kit from the past a rare yet gigantic mis-step from the Germans saw them instead influenced by a bottle of Lynx Africa.",
      "The only minor grumble one could reasonably have here is the similarity to a third kit Arsenal had a few years ago, and thus the fact that this shirt could be argued to represent the running out of ideas, with adidas leaning on the lightning bolt motif yet again on yet another retro-inspired Arsenal shirt.",
      "To this we say: Yeah, whatever, just look at it. It is lovely. And that’s the real quiz.",
      "Another thing in this shirt’s favour is that we vastly prefer the simple cannon logo to Arsenal’s full shield badge. We know why they don’t, but we strongly feel they should always just have the cannon. It is better."

      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",
      "Big themes for this season include: round collars, local ‘inspiration’ and more immediately obvious divergence between ‘replica’ and ‘authentic’ versions of shirts. We’re not really happy about any of those themes, if we’re honest.",
      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",

      "19) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",

      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",

      "15) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",

Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

Honestly, some people.",

      "12) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves.

      "10) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "9) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",

      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

But better to wait for a nice one than confirm a sh*t one, as we always say.",
      "Inevitably, the combination of red-and-white stripes plus hummel leads us down a vaguely Southampton route here, but while ‘is it obviously a Team X kit’ is one of our core criteria we are going to cut some slack here because we simply don’t think there’s any way around that particular puzzle without abandoning hummel altogether, and we’re very much in baby-with-the-bathwater territory there.",
      "Lovely simple kit, this, so much so that we don’t even mind the centred badge because everything is at least balanced. Collar is 10/10, the chevrons look as magnificent as ever, and quite simply hummel have done it again, as they nearly always do. Great bunch of lads.",

      "2) Manchester United\nYour mileage may vary, but personally we’re fans of predominantly black trim on a Manchester United shirt, and that feels even more important this year with Liverpool also back in the adidas fold. You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",

      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",
      "Hilarious japes aside, excellent shirt this. Unmistakably United, significantly different to – and we’re going to say better than – Liverpool’s own adidas effort.",

      "“I am finding out what is happening after it has happened, so we will try to bring the best to the football club – I will make that clear – but I can’t talk about individual targets.”",
      "Howe was also asked whether there was a scenario that may exist that he signs Sesko and keeps Isak, adding: “We are looking at the best players we can get.",
      "“We are only looking at the best we can get, I see all situations open and available to us. I feel that is the only way we are going to get where we want to go, which is to maximise quality over quantity.",
      "“That is the way it has always been, the way we work, we try to improve, we have don it pretty well to this point.",
      "“It has been a challenging summer as you know. We have missed out on loads of different targets for different reasons.",
      "“But we are still very competitive and we are still in there trying to bring good players to the club, that won’t change until the window shuts.”",
      "Liverpool could ‘step up interest’ in Real Madrid winger Rodrygo if they can’t get a deal for Alexander Isak over the line, according to reports.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Liverpool ‘sent a clear message’ to Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak with four points earlier this week.",
      "Liverpool are the ‘horny bull’, not Newcastle. And their inability to pull Alexander Isak could be offset by a potential position change at centre-half.",
      "Liverpool are expected to come back with an improved offer for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, if the Magpies sign a replacement, according to reports.",
      "Sesko has been confirmed as Isak’s ‘replacement’ in a boost for Liverpool in their bid to land their dream striker this summer.",
      "Why would Liverpool sign Alexander Isak when they’ve already got Darwin Nunez? And is there a way back for the Swede in a dressing room of ‘disgusted’ teammates?"

      "The Reds made a £110m bid for Isak on Friday, which was quickly rejected by Newcastle, who are holding out for £150m, with transfer expert Ben Jacobs suggesting Liverpool are now pulling out of negotiations.",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: “Exclusive: Liverpool have no plans as it stands to bid again for Alexander Isak this window. Nature of #NUFC’s rebuttal means Liverpool will NOT follow up with a second offer. Regarded as futile unless Newcastle change their stance and contact Liverpool.",
      "“Offer rejected was £110m. Terms with Isak not a problem.”",
      "Newcastle have reached out to Brentford over Yoane Wissa, who’s said to be training alone to force a move to St James’ Park, but the Bees are adamant he’s not for sale, at least until they can source a suitable replacement.",
      "And journalist Sacha Tavolieri confirmed overnight that Sesko is therefore ‘clearly ahead’ of Wissa as a Newcastle priority.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Benjamin Šeško now clearly moved ahead of Yoane Wissa on Newcastle United’s list of priorities. While the Congolese forward hasn’t been forgotten, the club is growing frustrated with Brentford FC’s behavior and wants to move forward with its striker plans. #NUFC moving forward on Šeško deal.’",
      "RB Leipzig want at least £64m for the 22-year-old and amid strong interest from Manchester United, it was claimed last week that Sesko was leaning towards a move to Old Trafford, even without European football, amid claims from Fabrizio Romano that footballers are now “scared” to join Newcastle.",

      "The Premier League kicks off in two weeks. Some clubs are ready; others are miles off it. We’re ranking all 20 by how catastrophically screwed they are – from the ones cruising to the one contemplating its very existence.",
      "",
      "20) Liverpool\nNot f**ked in the slightest. The reigning champions have strengthened beyond belief in the summer transfer window, smashing their transfer record for 22-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold with Jeremie Frimpong, improving at left-back by signing Milos Kerkez, adding one of the Bundesliga’s best players in Hugo Ekitike, and likely signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle United.",
      "Even without Isak, Liverpool are ridiculously strong. Adding him would just take the p*ss quite frankly.",
      "Their ambitious summer transfer window has been enabled by the club’s shrewd transfer business in recent seasons. Before the 2025 summer window opened, they were tenth in the five-year Premier League net spend table. They’re currently seventh and buying Isak wouldn’t take them into the top four unless Arsenal sell Bukayo Saka for £200million before then.",
      "Arne Slot won the title after signing one player for 2024/25; Federico Chiesa started four times across all competitions and will leave after just one year at Anfield. You can’t blame the club’s hierarchy for not backing the manager heavily last summer, and having gathered the strongest evidence possible, they know they have an elite title-winning head coach and spending big on players he wants makes absolute sense. The Reds have played it to perfection.",
      "Manchester United should be taking notes after giving Erik ten Hag hundreds of millions in his first transfer window, and going all in on players for Ruben Amorim’s system, knowing that if it goes tits up, they’ll likely appoint a manager who doesn’t want half of the playing squad…again.",
      "TL;DR: Liverpool won the league comfortably and have strengthened like no champion has before. They are title favourites and signed all of their pre-planned transfer targets weeks before the Premier League season kicks off.",
      "MORE: Liverpool keep or sell: Eight Reds sold as Nunez, Elliott help fund record Isak transfer",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea\nThese guys are set…for the next five years. They can and should relax a bit, but we all know they won’t. They must fuel their transfer addiction. Chelsea have always been erratic and ambitious in the transfer window, but things have been cranked up a notch in the Clearlake era.",
      "Joao Pedro and Liam Delap are excellent striker additions, Jamie Gittens is a questionable one for £50m, but we’re not writing him off, Andrey Santos is Like A New Signing, and Estevao is a genuine wonderkid. We like this Chelsea squad and their title credentials.",
      "",
      "18) Arsenal\nNow that a striker is through the door, it has to be said that Arsenal are only an elite left-winger away from having the perfect squad. And that signing is more desirable than required, with Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard and Noni Madueke capable options on that side for now.",
      "Signing Viktor Gyokeres was the big one for the Gunners, with Martin Zubimendi’s addition in midfield also significant. It’s always been about the need for an out-and-out centre-forward, though. The big Swede made his debut against Spurs in Hong Kong on Thursday, but could not prevent a 1-0 defeat that we are not looking into too much, even if Mikel Arteta’s side were toothless in attack and many of the same issues from last season were on display. Not looking into it, though.",
      "All in all, the club’s transfer activity has been uncharacteristically ruthless, but still well planned out and meticulous. They took their time weighing up their options before picking Gyokeres over Benjamin Sesko, for instance.",
      "If this isn’t Arsenal’s year, then it’s never happening under Arteta, whether it’s in the Premier League or Champions League. Although Arsenal are where they are because of the Spaniard, it does feel like do or die for him. After so much money spent and five years of his #process, this club needs something tangible to show for their improvement, and it might take a proven winner in the dugout for that to happen.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City\nPep Guardiola got the majority of his transfer business done early this summer due to the club’s involvement in the Club World Cup. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki were all through the door in time to play in the United States, and Norwegian wonderkid Sverre Nypan and goalkeeper James Trafford have since signed.",
      "They are all set for another season under Guardiola and you wouldn’t put it past them steamrolling to the title, even if the two clubs who finished above them last term have improved.",
      "Rodri is back, but Kevin De Bruyne is gone, so it’s not easy to predict how City’s year will pan out.",
      "One potential issue is the lack of a right-back signing. Matheus Nunes can’t be the long-term option in that position. Then again, Guardiola is probably planning to make natural centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov the best right-back in the league, and there’s nothing anyone will be able to do about it.",
      "",
      "16) Brighton and Hove Albion\nFor me, Clive, Brighton had to get a new centre-back in early doors, and they did just that with Diego Coppola, who was among Europe’s top aerial duel winners last season.",
      "For good measure, they added Olivier Boscagli from PSV on a free transfer. He could end up being the bargain of the summer. Let’s not look past Maxim De Kuyper as well. He’s why Pervis Estupinan left without a fuss.",
      "They might have lost Joao Pedro, but £30m wonderkid Charalampos Kostoulas and Stefanos Tzimas have joined. Brighton won’t just be fine, they’ll be looking at the clubs above them who are stumbling through this transfer window, thinking there’s an opportunity.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester United\nSo, United look pretty decent. Their pre-season performances have been promising, and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are two excellent additions.",
      "This is a huge summer for the club, with Ruben Amorim’s players needing to adapt to his 3-4-2-1 system after over half a season of being unable to do so. This break – and reset – was needed.",
      "The Red Devils could obviously add more players to up the expectations even more, but we think the only position they *need* to improve is centre-forward.",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland\nWe’re big fans of the business conducted by newly-promoted Sunderland. Granit Xhaka, in particular, is a ridiculously good signing. He’s a Champions League midfielder, for crying out loud.",
      "The Black Cats have been ambitious, but so were Burnley, Ipswich and Luton Town over the last two seasons. It’s going to be tough, but this team is becoming well-equipped to survive.",
      "",
      "13) Nottingham Forest\nAfter signing a striker, replacing Anthony Elanga was Forest’s top priority, and they’ve done so excellently with the addition of Switzerland international Dan Ndoye.",
      "For Forest, keeping their best players was the most important thing, though bulking up the squad is necessary after Nuno Espirito Santo’s men ran out of steam in their Champions League pursuit last term. They successfully scared off Spurs and extended Morgan Gibbs-White’s contract, and haven’t been forced to deal with any serious interest in Murillo, Callum Hudson-Odoi or Elliot Anderson.",
      "Last season exceeded every Forest fan’s expectations, but we’re predicting another fun year, especially with a European campaign to look forward to. The City Ground under the lights on Thursday nights will be special.",
      "",
      "12) Tottenham Hotspur\nMohammed Kudus improves an area of the pitch Spurs needed to improve, and some of their depth issues were addressed in January, so the Europa League holders don’t need to do too much.",
      "Another midfielder is needed, and there are reports of Joao Palhinha coming in. He’d add something different to an energetic midfield, but after missing out on Gibbs-White, we wouldn’t be surprised to see Thomas Frank go for Harvey Elliott, or someone similar.",
      "And on Frank, that’s a top appointment. Getting the managerial situation sorted quickly was vitally important and Daniel Levy did exactly that.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nQuestion marks over Daniel Farke’s future were squashed before Leeds’ transfer business started, and their business has been impressive for the most part. Anton Stach is the standout signing, while Lucas Perri and Jaka Bijol are savvy additions for a newly-promoted side.",
      "It will be a long season for the Elland Road faithful, but there are ten clubs, six of which they’d fancy pulling into a relegation battle, who are in a worse position going into it.",
      "",
      "10) Burnley\nBurnley haven’t necessarily found themselves in a position where they are, per se, f**ked, but they’re hardly filling us with confidence. Kyle Walker is past it but remains a solid addition; we rate the Marcus Edwards deal, and think Sam Johnstone would be a good replacement for James Trafford.",
      "Whatever happens between now and the start of the season, just know that Scott Parker isn’t making it to Christmas. We don’t make the rules.",
      "",
      "9) Fulham\nMarco Silva’s only summer signing so far is back-up goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte. Not ideal, that. But maybe the Portuguese head coach is happy with his squad. Keeping Rodrigo Muniz seems to be Fulham’s top priority right now, but there’s a definite need for a new wide forward. Raheem Sterling has been mooted and we think it’s a great fit for the player and club; he wouldn’t even need to move house.",
      "This club needs a deep cup run or European push, and they’re going to need to get moving if either is to become a realistic objective.",
      "",
      "8) West Ham\nGraham Potter surely hoped for more of a rebuild at West Ham this summer. So far he’s lost Kudus, been forced to sign Jean-Clair Todibo permanently, added Kyle Walker-Peters on a free, and signed young wing-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.",
      "This is a team lacking top quality and athleticism in forward areas. There’s only so much Jarrod Bowen can do.",
      "One big positive is that Lucas Paqueta no longer has a potential ban hanging over his head, having been cleared of spot-fixing charges. Hopefully for the Irons, this will relieve pressure, tension and be a huge weight off the Brazilian’s shoulders, and they’ll enjoy watching him back to his best. There is talk of him leaving for as little as £25m, though, which might be off the table following the result of his case with the FA.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nThe Eagles’ pre-season preparation has been heavily impacted by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding their first-ever European campaign. It’s contributed to the club only making two signings – back-up goalkeeper Walter Benitez for nothing and left-back Borna Sosa for £2m.",
      "Oliver Glasner knows there has to be more transfer activity: “Even though all the players are still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far. I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year. As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day like last year, another false start is possible.”",
      "Openly discussing a broken promise with the board is an ominous sign. Of course, the board’s focus is elsewhere, but Glasner’s concentration is fully on getting his team prepared for the season, and that preparation isn’t going to plan. Yes, he’s still got Jean-Philippe Mateta, Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi – but for how long? Palace have reportedly turned down £30m from Atlanta United for Mateta, Arsenal are expected to sign Eze, and Guehi is a Liverpool target in the last year of his contract.",
      "Another key figure in their final 12 months is Glasner. The club are in discussions, but it’s hard to envision the Austrian head coach agreeing terms if those promises aren’t fulfilled. Palace going down isn’t realistic, but they are threatening to start 2025/26 very slowly. With a Thursday-Sunday schedule to contend with, they might not get up and running fast enough to make this upcoming campaign half as memorable as the last one.",
      "",
      "6) Bournemouth\nThis is not based entirely on losing 4-1 to Manchester United in pre-season, though we couldn’t be blamed if it was.",
      "We don’t think they’re in relegation trouble, but Bournemouth’s defence has been ripped apart, and they’ve only signed a left-back to replace Milos Kerkez. Dean Huijsen still hasn’t been replaced and Illia Zabarnyi is a top Paris Saint-Germain target. For months, we’ve been saying that the Cherries need a right-back with Adam Smith past his best and Julian Araujo struggling, but now that’s the least of their worries.",
      "Andoni Iraola has, at least, secured the signing of a new goalkeeper after being unable to make Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan permanent. Djordje Petrovic is an excellent signing and arguably better than Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, Robert Sanchez.",
      "Bournemouth are relaxed. Having made £90m alone from Huijsen and Kerkez, they’re under no pressure to sell Zabarnyi, but the Ukrainian wants to join PSG. He hasn’t stayed at home or gone to train at his old club to force the move, though. Fair play.",
      "The fact of the matter is, they aren’t close to signing a centre-back after failing to sign Lille’s Bafode Diakite, and they need two of them. It’s also been suggested that they want to sign a striker on loan with Enes Unal injured until November.",
      "There’s still plenty to do, but Bournemouth have extended Antoine Semenyo’s contract and are expected to keep hold of him, Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.",
      "",
      "5) Wolves\nThere is a serious threat of relegation looming at Molineux, and the fact that fans are furious over Nelson Semedo’s departure says a lot about the state the club is in. No offence, Nelson.",
      "There’s a concerning lack of quality throughout Vitor Pereira’s squad, and the man who carried Wolves through most of last season, Matheus Cunha, is long gone. Replaced by Fluminense’s Jhon Arias, Wolves should have plenty of money left over, having made over £60m from the Brazilian’s sale.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen joining permanently is a boost, and Arias could be as exciting and influential as Cunha, but this is another transfer window that the Midlands club are failing to take advantage of.",
      "It’s easier said than done to just replace Cunha with someone as good. Unfortunately, that’s not realistic, unless head coach Pereira can bring the absolute most out of someone unexpectedly. We just can’t see it, and the lack of invention in midfield, attack and full-back spells trouble. Oh, and they need a goalkeeper.",
      "Also, we can’t explain why, but Pereira stinks of an acrimonious November exit. We look forward to it.",
      "",
      "4) Everton\nDavid Moyes expected more from Everton’s summer transfer window, and he’s not a happy bunny. He’s being left short all over the pitch, with his side struggling in pre-season, drawing against Accrington Stanley and losing to Blackburn Rovers and Bournemouth.",
      "“The truth is we’re not getting them over the line at the moment – that’s a fact,” a frustrated Moyes said to reporters in the United States. “We’re not getting a lot of the deals done which we’re hoping to do, so we’re continually reassessing and moving on, while maybe things are not coming to fruition… We’re desperate to get things moving on because we know time’s running out.”",
      "Everton enjoyed themselves (for once) in the second half of last season and had reason for optimism in 2025/26, especially as they’re moving into a new stadium. With two weeks to go until they open their season with a trip to Leeds United, Moyes needs a winger, midfielder, right-back and centre-back. Not much, then.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nOne of the clubs most restricted by the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, Villa have been worryingly inactive in the summer transfer window.",
      "The addition of Yasin Ozcan is their only signing for a fee, and only Fulham (£437k) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less. There have been some striker rumours involving Samu Aghehowa and Lois Openda, but most of the club’s transfer stories are about sales, not signings.",
      "One sale could be Ollie Watkins, and there’s also a possibility that Morgan Rogers leaves, while Leon Bailey, Jacob Ramsey and Emiliano Martinez have been linked with exits.",
      "The position the Villans are in is very surprising. This time last year, they were looking forward to a Champions League campaign after unsettling the status quo with a fourth-place finish in the Premier League. Now, they are worried about being dismantled while their rivals strengthen at pace and they remain shackled.",
      "The need for attacking reinforcements was underlined by the loan signings of Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford and the permanent arrival of Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund in January. Asensio and Rashford were only on loan and contributed to 29.3% of Villa’s goals scored between February and the end of the season. They also had seven assists. Malen should have a bigger role next season after being cast aside following Rashford’s arrival, being left out of Unai Emery’s squad for the Champions League knockout rounds.",
      "Losing over a quarter of your goals must be addressed, and Villa’s lack of signings emphasises the need for a big sale. Rogers would be a gut-wrenching departure, but you have to break eggs to make an omelette. Getting clarity on players like Rogers, Watkins and Martinez is imperative, and it’s clear that Emery needs reinforcements all over the pitch.",
      "The one positive is that Boubacar Kamara has signed a new five-year contract. Positive Villa fans will tell you that’s more significant than any signing they make this summer.",
      "",
      "2) Brentford\nKeith Andrews’ Brentford are firmly in ‘We fear for them’ territory. The loss of Thomas Frank is gargantuan, and replacing him with a rookie head coach is extremely risky. Then you have the exits of club captain Christian Norgaard and star player Bryan Mbeumo, which was inevitable but still stings, and the Yoane Wissa debacle.",
      "Wissa reportedly feels betrayed by the club, who promised him a £26m transfer this summer if he stayed for 2024/25. He did, yet he’s not been allowed to join Newcastle following Mbeumo’s move to Manchester United.",
      "Too many key figures have departed for Brentford fans to be anything but sceptical of their survival chances this season. Relegation has not been a threat since their promotion in 2021, but with no Frank, Norgaard, Mbeumo and Wissa, it’s looking rather bleak.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United\nShambolic doesn’t begin to cover whatever is going on at Newcastle this summer. It’s baffling, disgraceful, and everything in between. Some things are out of their hands, but there’s no decisiveness in their transfer pursuits, which has seen several targets slip through their grasp like a lubed-up mini egg.",
      "The Magpies have botched pursuits of Joao Pedro, James Trafford, Hugo Ekitike, Liam Delap and could miss out on Benjamin Sesko because he’s “scared” he’ll be blocked from a future move. Losing out on the RB Leipzig striker to Manchester United will be the final straw for some fans.",
      "After winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, this was supposed to be a monumental summer for the club. Instead, it’s been a monumental disaster. And we haven’t even got into the Alexander Isak ordeal yet…",
      "There’s not much they can do, but the black and white wounds are already well-salted. The biggest question is: why now, Alex? The timing is baffling and the spotlight is on a club in disarray.",
      "Villa might be in a bit of bother, but we fear for Eddie Howe and his players in their first Premier League game of the season away to Emery’s side.",

Nine-figure sums are simply what’s required for world-class central midfielders these days.",

      "Liverpool failed with their opening offer of £110million for Isak, and reportedly won’t return with an improved offer due to Newcastle’s swift and strong response.",
      "The Magpies don’t want to sell the Swede, but it’s believed that a deal could be done for £150m.",
      "Isak is doing all he can to secure a move to Anfield. He’s not training in the north east after being left behind for the club’s pre-season tour of Asia, and is currently using the facilities of his old club, Real Sociedad.",
      "Despite his desire to leave and his recent behavior, Newcastle are willing to reintegrate the player and want him to sign a new contract.",
      "Isak will not be swayed by another Premier League team, having made it clear Liverpool is his dream destination, with the Reds willing to spend over £100m on him despite recently adding Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz for a combined £169m this summer.",
      "Interestingly, it’s been reported that Man United made an enquiry this week, but were ‘turned down’.",
      "This is according to Sky Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg, who says Isak remains optimistic that he will join Liverpool this summer, having agreed a six-year contract.",
      "Plettenberg wrote on X: ‘Understand Alexander #Isak has once again made it clear that he only wants to join Liverpool FC.",
      "‘Even Manchester United made an enquiry in recent days, but Isak turned it down. He only wants #LFC.",
      "‘The player’s camp remain optimistic that an agreement can be reached this transfer window, after a £120m bid was rejected by #NUFC. Isak’s agreement with LFC until 2031 is 100% done.’",
      "Ben Jacobs initially broke the news that Liverpool won’t make a second offer for Isak on Friday afternoon, and the transfer journalist has provided a few more updates since, explaining what could see the Reds return to the negotiating table.",
      "Reporting on X, Jacobs explained the state of play:",
      "– Liverpool say no second bid planned as it stands, as revealed.",
      "– Bid was £110m fixed, with no add-ons.",
      "– Personal terms with Isak not a problem.",
      "– Liverpool bid with optimism this morning, but Newcastle’s response was so quick and strong another bid is not currently in the works.",
      "– Key now is how Isak responds. Newcastle hoping he reintegrates and are prepared to offer him a new contract, likely with the ability to leave next summer.",
      "– Should Isak double down, and continue to push for a move, and Newcastle find striker replacements, Liverpool could revisit their stance, but only if #NUFC contact them to offer encouragement. Liverpool won’t bid again unless Newcastle indicate they will discuss a sale.",

      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "Al Nassr fail in attempt to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes; contact was made through intermediaries but there was no formal approach to Man Utd.",
      "By Vik Varange",
      "Sunday 3 August 2025 22:11, UK",
      "Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr have failed in an attempt to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Contact was made through intermediaries, but there was no formal approach to Man Utd from Al Nassr, whose captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portugal team-mate of Fernandes.",
      "The Man Utd midfielder rejected the chance to join Saudi Pro League rivals Al Hilal earlier this summer.",
      "Al Hilal had been willing to almost treble Fernandes' £250,000-a-week wages, having been prepared to pay Man Utd £100m to sign the club's captain.",
      "But the 30-year-old turned down their offer as he did not want to move to Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.",
      "Manchester United do not want to sell their captain, who has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year.",
      "The Portugal international has contributed 98 goals and 87 assists in 290 games in all competitions since moving to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020.",
      "Fernandes has been in good form on Man Utd's pre-season tour of the USA, scoring both goals in the 2-1 win over West Ham.",
      "Fernandes confirmed in early June that he had rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and revealed how talks with his wife and Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim were key in his decision.",
      "Fernandes told a Portugal press conference: \"The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask about the possibility of me moving there.",
      "\"I had to wait a while to think about the future. As I've always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on.",
      "\"I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it.",
      "\"I spoke to the club, who said they weren't willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.",
      "\"From my side, it was a very ambitious proposal, the president was a fantastic person. I never talked about the money, it ended up coming up later, with my agent.",
      "\"I had to make the decision as a family and understand what I wanted for my future. That was the question my wife asked, what my professional goals would be. At no point did she say yes or no, she always supported me and put my professional side first.",
      "\"It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Ruben Neves, Joao Cancelo. My children are used to playing with theirs.",
      "\"But I simply want to stay at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, because I still feel capable of that.",
      "\"I want to continue to be happy and do what I love most. I'm still very passionate about this sport. It's my way of seeing football and I'm happy with my decision.\"",

      "Sunday 3 August 2025 20:26, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed he wants to be Manchester United head coach for the next 20 years.",
      "The Portuguese boss is about to take charge of his first full campaign at Old Trafford - his first half-season saw him guide the club to 15th place and defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "Performances in pre-season have left Amorim hopeful that United are a \"completely different side\" to last term, and the 40-year-old is now backing himself to have a Sir Alex Ferguson-style tenure at United.",
      "\"Something will happen. In some moments, I will be lucky. I had a lot of luck during my career as a manager and my idea is to stay for many years.",
      "\"But again we know that the results will dictate that. I know that last season I used (up) all the credits, but I'm ready to start fresh.",
      "\"I want to be manager of Manchester United for a while. And I took five years to choose this club so I don't want to fail.\"",
      "Asked about his chances of success at United, Amorim replied: \"If you look, Sporting was the same thing. They said that in three months I'm out.",
      "\"They said that I had three per cent (chance) of winning one title with Sporting. It was the same thing.\"",
      "Amorim has revealed that the biggest disappointment of last season was turning up to games knowing his side could not be competitive.",
      "Fourteen of In his 27 Premier League games in charge have ended in defeat, while he also lost five out of his first seven matches at Old Trafford.",
      "He said: \"To tell you the truth, it's not how I returned to my house after the games but how I left to go to the games. All the struggles that we had in the games, I feel it before the games.",
      "\"So that is the hardest part. To go to the games and know that we are not going to be competitive. When I returned, I just looked to my family and tried to think about different things. But I was really frustrated.\"",
      "Amorim also addressed United's transfer situation this summer - with a focus on outgoings at the moment.",
      "United have already let Marcus Rashford leave to join Barcelona but the futures of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho are still up in the air.",
      "United have not taken the quartet on their Premier League Summer Series tour squad and gave them more time away from the club during pre-season to find themselves new clubs.",
      "\"We just need to follow the markets,\" said Amorim about those four players. \"So the market is open. There are players that clearly show they don't want to be here and that is normal. They are not bad and I'm good. I'm not bad and they are good.",
      "\"It's a simple situation that they want new challenges. So we will try to use this space to prepare the team that I think is going to be here.",
      "\"If the market closes and then they are Manchester United players, we as a club have to treat them in the same conditions. But in this moment I'm just working with the players that I think are going to stay and the other guys are trying to find a solution for their careers.\"",
      "Amorim was also asked specifically about Garnacho - who has been linked with a move to Chelsea and Aston Villa.",
      "The United boss believes the academy product is still a talented player but says things have not worked out for the 21-year-old at Old Trafford.",
      "\"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy and sometimes things don't work out,\" said Amorim. \"You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge so we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Amorim also revealed the sales this summer are important because he wants a smaller squad this season - given United are not in European competition so will only fight on three fronts.",
      "\"I'm really happy with the team,\" said Amorim. \"Without European competitions, I want a small squad so everyone feels really important.",
      "\"If you have a lot of players, you have one week to prepare and a lot of players are going to be out, and then in training they will be frustrated and then the quality of the training will drop.\"",

      "Manchester United have joined Newcastle in the race for Benjamin Sesko; Newcastle made a £69.8m bid on Saturday with discussions continuing over the structure, but Man Utd are talking to the Bundesliga club, but have not made an offer; Man Utd can buy without having to sell first",
      "Sunday 3 August 2025 20:26, UK",
      "Newcastle United and Manchester United are in talks with RB Leipzig over the signing of striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Newcastle made their move on Saturday with an offer worth £69.8m including add-ons. Discussions continue over the structure of that deal.",
      "There is no official bid from Man Utd yet. Their negotiations surround what they would be prepared to pay and how they would pay it. A decision on whether a formal bid goes in will be based on those talks.",
      "It was thought Man Utd would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood that RB Leipzig are interested in striker Rasmus Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking Hojlund on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "United could consider suitable offers for Hojlund, provided they are right for the club and the player.",
      "Hojlund has started both games on the club's pre-season tour of the US and has publicly said he wants to stay and fight for his place, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has reportedly told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, RB Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko on Saturday.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle's bid for Sesko comes with the Magpies bracing themselves for a second offer from Liverpool for Alexander Isak.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe confirmed the club rejected a bid from Liverpool for Isak, but is unsure on what will happen next.",
      "Isak returned to Newcastle on Saturday following his personal training camp in Spain.",
      "The Newcastle striker has been training at Real Sociedad's training headquarters on his own, after refusing to travel with Newcastle on their pre-season tour of Asia. Isak reported a thigh injury and travelled to San Sebastián to recover with his own staff.",
      "Eddie Howe said on Saturday morning in South Korea that he found out Isak had travelled to Spain via the media.",
      "\"From my situation I am very much removed from what was happening back home,\" Howe said in a press conference ahead of facing Tottenham on Sunday in South Korea.",
      "\"I was made aware of a bid yesterday and that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. People back in England are dealing with the situation.",
      "\"I really don't know what happens next. From our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.",
      "\"It is difficult because you don't know what is going to happen. There can be all sorts of talk and hypothetical situations but then you are dealing with reality.",
      "\"The reality is we had the first bid from Liverpool yesterday. I believe that was turned down, from this point onwards let's see what happens.",
      "\"I have no idea to try to predict that. In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right. I can't talk about other clubs, that is not for me to say.\"",
      "Howe has added Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit with Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, but the Brentford striker is still not featuring for Keith Andrews' first team.",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change till the window shuts.\"",

      "Newcastle have made a bid worth roughly £70m for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko while Manchester United are also keen; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Sunday 3 August 2025 18:01, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle have bid £70m and Manchester United are also considering a move.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",
