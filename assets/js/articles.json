      "Cristiano Ronaldo's career may finally be winding down. The Portugal legend has already admitted the World Cup in the United States will be his last and conceded he may have just a couple of years left in the game.",
      "That leaves a little time for the 40-year-old Portugal international to make some final twists and turns before turning his attention to club ownership away from the field. For the moment, Ronaldo is keen to live in the moment, however.",
      "Asked about his future in an interview on Tuesday, having told Piers Morgan Uncensored last week he would retire “soon”, Ronaldo initially joked that “soon” meant “in 10 years” before adding: “When I mean soon…. I’m really enjoying the moment right now. As you know in football, when you reach some age you count the months very quick.",
      "“So, the moment is good, I feel very good in this moment, I score goals, I still feel quick and sharp, I’m enjoying my game in the national team and Al Nassr, but of course, let’s be honest, when I mean ‘soon’ it’s probably one, two years I’ll still be in the game.”",
      "“As I told you before, I am enjoying the moment, but when I mean soon, it’s really soon because I give everything for football, I’m in the game for the last 25 years, I did everything, I have many records in the different scenarios in the clubs and also in the national team – I’m really proud,\" he added.",
      "Ronaldo is under contract at Al-Nassr until after his 42nd birthday after signing a deal worth a minimum £492million over two years earlier in 2025. That would suggest the Saudi Pro League side would be his final team.",
      "But can the five-time Ballon d'Or winner ignore his mother's wish? Dolores Aveiro dreams of her son and grandson playing their trade in Portugal together before Ronaldo brings his career to a close.",
      "In 2022, Aveiro declared her desire to see Ronaldo return to his first club, Sporting CP. The matriarch has even told him as much.",
      "She told a Portuguese magazine: “Cristiano has to come back here. If it was up to me he’d be back already. “I already told him: ‘Son, before I die I want to see you playing for Sporting again.",
      "\"It didn’t happen this year but perhaps it will next year. But if it’s not him it will be Cristianinho. At his age he plays better than his father. When he was 12 Cristiano didn’t have a trainer but today he’s his son’s teacher.”",
      "The 67-year-old told Nova Gente in an interview: “He’s already said, ‘Dad when we go to live in Lisbon I want to play for Sporting. Seeing the two of them playing together at the club would be my dream.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has rejected the chance to return for a second spell as Ajax manager. The Dutch giants sacked Johnny Heitinga last week after overseeing a disastrous run of just two wins in 11 games.",
      "Ajax are in crisis mode and sit fourth in the Eredivisie, already 11 points behind league leaders and bitter rivals PSV Eindhoven. They're also rock bottom of the 36-team Champions League table after losing their opening four matches and only scoring one goal.",
      "Ten Hag, 55, is out of work and quickly emerged as the favourite after being spotted with his agent, Alex Kroes, and Ajax's technical director, Alex Kroes. The Dutchman spent four-and-a-half years in Amsterdam, winning the title in each of his three full seasons.",
      "But according to Dutch outlet NOS, Ten Hag has decided against returning to Ajax. It's claimed that the 55-year-old, who was also linked with Premier League side Wolves, thought 'the conditions were not right for a successful partnership'.",
      "Marc Overmars also won't be returning, having been the club's technical director when Ten Hag led Ajax to famous victories over Real Madrid and Juventus, the high point of his tenure. \"For me, it's over,\" the ex-Arsenal forward told De Telegraaf this week.",
      "United came calling for Ten Hag in the summer of 2022 and he won two trophies with the Red Devils before being dismissed last October. Ten Hag then bided his time, waiting until the beginning of this season to get back into management.",
      "The 55-year-old replaced Xabi Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen. But after failing to win any of his first three games, losing key players in the summer transfer window and with multiple reports of behind-the-scenes discontent, he was ruthlessly sacked in September.",
      "Ten Hag criticised Leverkusen's decision, issuing a statement which read: \"The decision by Bayer Leverkusen this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a manager after just two league matches is unprecedented.",
      "\"This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust. A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play.",
      "\"I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret. I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust.",
      "\"Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success. Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware.\"",

      "Axel Tuanzebe was once touted as a future captain of Manchester United by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after progressing through the academy ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "But he now finds himself suing his former as he reportedly seeks £1million in damages from United for allegedly harming his career. Tuanzebe, who now plays for Burnley, claims United are to blame for medical issues which he says continue to impact his career.",
      "The defender has struggled with injury throughout his career and it emerged in July that Tuanzebe was filing a lawsuit against United for alleged “clinical negligence”.",
      "Tuanzebe's story with United started many years ago in the academy, with the talented defender making his senior debut at 19 when he played in the FA Cup against Wigan. He would extend his contract just days later. The youngster had already captained the academy side and won the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award before claiming the Denzil Haroun Reserve Team Player of the Year.",
      "Things were going well as he made his Champions League debut the following season before being handed the opportunity to prove himself on loan at Aston Villa. This was a tougher endeavour as he made just five appearances due to injury, and the form of John Terry and James Chester saw him struggle for playing time.",
      "However, the Midlands side must have seen something they liked, as he returned the very next season and had even greater success, eventually playing 90 minutes in the play-off final win over Derby. Tuanzebe was able to learn from Terry, who transitioned into a coaching role.",
      "\"I have a good relationship with John,\" he told manutd.com. \"He helps me a lot every day and continuously gives me pointers on how to improve my game.\"",
      "That season saw him return to United with the opportunity to truly break through. It wasn't long before, at 21, he became the youngest player to captain United since Norman Whiteside in 1985, during a September 2019 win over Rochdale.",
      "While it appeared Tuanzebe could be a regular starter his progress was hampered by first a hip injury and then a season-ending hamstring injury that, combined with a pre-season ankle injury, kept him out for 10 months.",
      "Tuanzebe soon drew praise for an impressive Champions League outing against Paris Saint-Germain, before becoming a Europa League regular and making 19 Premier League appearances. It was even in this role that his leadership stood out.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saw him as a future captain of the club. The Norwegian coach had plenty of faith in his charge.",
      "\"Axel is a captain in the making, he's a leader. Why not give it to young kids?\" Solskjaer told Talksport in 2020. \"How does he handle it? He was absolutely fine, he enjoyed it. It’s just a way of telling him that we trust him.\"",
      "\"We have a lot of leaders in the dressing room, a lot of senior pros,” Harry Maguire said in 2021. “And you don’t have to be a senior pro to be a leader. Axel is a leader, in the ways that he works and speaks in the dressing room.",
      "“And he’s only a young boy, he’s still learning his trade. I’m sure he’ll go on to have an unbelievable career.\"",
      "But Tuanzebe's progress was not able to continue at Old Trafford and 2021/22 saw him split the season between Aston Villa and Napoli. Only 13 appearances followed that season and injury disrupted the prospect's chances of impressing Erik Ten Hag.",
      "A final loan to Stoke City ended his United career, as struggles with fitness hampered his time there.",
      "Ipswich Town and former Manchester United coach Kieran McKenna was willing to hand Tuanzebe an opportunity on a one-year deal, however. The Tractor Boys' boss McKenna said: \"We want to build him up in a sensible way and get him back to his best condition. If we do that, we feel we could have a very valuable asset for the team.\"",
      "It took until the second part of the season for the defender to establish himself in the team, but he helped them gain promotion to the Premier League. The defender's deal was extended, and despite requiring surgery to save his thumb in an accident while washing dishes, Tuanzebe made 22 league appearances.",
      "Ipswich failed to stay up but Tuanzebe remains in the Premier League after completing a free transfer to Burnley. After missing the start of the season, Tuanzebe has completed 90 minutes in the Clarets' last five top-flight games under Scott Parker.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Andy Burnham has emphasised that \"not a penny of public money\" will be provided to build Manchester United's new stadium. Back in March, United revealed ambitious proposals for a cutting-edge 100,000-capacity stadium at a London event, with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggesting the scheme could be finished by 2030.",
      "Ratcliffe suggested the possibility of taxpayer funding for the £2billion venture, arguing: \"People in the north pay their taxes and there is an argument you could think about a more ambitious project in the north which would be fitting for England, for the Champions League final or the FA Cup final.\"",
      "Burnham, Greater Manchester's mayor, has previously made clear that no public funding would be provided for the stadium itself, and he reinforced that position on The Added Time Podcast.",
      "Burnham explained: \"It's not about giving them money because we have a really clear principle here at the start of this journey with the Mayoral Development Corporation. Manchester United will be paying for the stadium. There will not be a penny of public money going into that.",
      "\"But we have absolutely a role to play in making everything around the stadium as good as it can be because of the economic benefit that brings. If you think about it, there is a train station behind the stand there and it's not been used for a number of years for safety reasons.",
      "\"Part of it would see that station relocated a little bit, maybe a bit nearer Lou Macari's chippy or somewhere near there, and that would then reopen and massively benefit existing communities, Gorst Hill, Stretford and the people who live there, so the public benefit of this would be massive.",
      "\"Thousands of new homes, thousands of new jobs, so it's much wider than the ground itself.\"",
      "Burnham outlined the goal of hosting the 2035 World Cup final in Manchester, explaining: \"I am closely involved to the point where we've just asked parliament to establish a Mayoral Development Corporation. So that is a vehicle, a legal entity, that will oversee the wider regeneration of the whole area.",
      "\"That is more my responsibility, the wider environment around any new stadium. It's a huge opportunity for us as a city and a region. If you think about that area, it's the area around the old Salford docks.",
      "\"You've got Media City on the other side. This could be a global location if we get it right. I know people here kind of struggle to see why it impacts life on this end of the M62 [Liverpool], but actually there are freight terminals behind the existing Old Trafford that send lots of trains through Manchester city centre.",
      "\"That is a major cause of the chaos on railways across the north because it causes blockages in Manchester. Therefore, every train coming across the country is often then late getting over to Liverpool.",
      "\"So it's a project that actually makes sense on loads of levels. It actually would lead to the freight tunnels being relocated to St Helens and therefore growth here [Liverpool].",
      "\"It's a major growth project for the whole of the north west. And the enticing prospect in my mind is if we really get it moving, I think there's a fairly high likelihood that we will be hosting the women's FIFA World Cup in 2035.",
      "\"Imagine a final at that new Old Trafford. It would be quite something, wouldn't it?\"",
      "The blueprint for the proposed ground has been put on hold while talks continue over purchasing the required territory.",
      "Freightliner owns the railway depot that surrounds Old Trafford and securing this site remains vital to the scheme.",
      "United remain confident of striking an agreement to purchase the land for their new stadium venture.",

      "Los Blancos landed the Brazilian teenager in 2022 from Palmeiras, although he didn't move to Spain until 2024. Despite being highly regarded his opportunities have been at a premium and there has long been talk of a move away to aid his development with a whole host of clubs across Europe keen on the young attacker.",
      "It's Lyon who look to have won the race for his services, though, with a move in January on the cards, reports Globo Esporte. They currently sit seventh in Ligue 1 and are led by Paulo Fonseca, who will hope the arrival of Endrick can enhance their season, which sees them well sat in the Europa League.",
      "Real and Lyon are working on the framework of the deal, which won't be signed until closer to the January window. The Spanish giants will include a clause that allows them to recall their player in the even of a mass injury crisis.",
      "Xabi Alonso had previously ruled out a loan move for Endrick, but looked to have changed his stance. The former Bayer Leverkusen boss had also made it clear that the forward couldn't let his frustration get the better of him and instead take his chance when it eventually came.",
      "He said: \"It's clear everyone wants to play. And a young player even more so. Given the context, we want to compete right now, and it's difficult depending on the match. He has to be patient, be prepared, and know that he's at Real Madrid. His time will come.\"",
      "Vinicius Jnr, Kylian Mbappe and Rodrygo had been Real's preferred front three last term, but Rodrygo has fallen out of favour in more recent months. Alonso claims he is keen to get Endrick onto the pitch but has never found the right moment.",
      "He said: “Of course, I’d like him to have played already. But the situations in our recent matches have been very tight since Endrick returned. I hope he can get those minutes soon. He’s training well, he’s ready - but the right moment has to come.”",

The 50-year-old explained that he couldn't disrupt a carefully structured routine he shares with his ex-wife Claire, in which they each care for Aiden, 20, three nights per week, with Claire's mum looking after him on the seventh night.",

      "Manchester United are weighing up a loan move for Conor Gallagher in January - which would potentially open the door for Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford having fallen down the pecking order.",
      "Ruben Amorim was keen to add a new midfielder in the summer, leading to their interest in Brighton's Carlos Baleba. But after spending in excess of £200million on a new-look attack for the 2025-26 campaign, United did not add to their engine room before the transfer window shut.",
      "It's since emerged that United DID approach Atletico Madrid over a loan move for the England international but the Spanish giants were only interested in a permanent deal, with the former Chelsea man remaining in La Liga. Now the Daily Mail reports that United will return again in 2026.",
      "They will again come in with an initial loan offer, but this time with the view to a £45million permanent switch in the summer. Gallagher is thought to be happy at Atletico, but equally wants to play regularly with a World Cup place on his radar.",
      "Gallagher has started just four matches in all competitions this season and United may be able to offer the prospect of regular football with question marks over their current midfield picture - which has involved a lack of involvement for Mainoo.",
      "A successful move for the former Blues star would likely push Mainoo further down the pecking order. He was hailed when he came through the ranks under Erik ten Hag, but has seen his stock fall since Amorim arrived in the dugout. The club blocked Mainoo’s attempts to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League match this season whilst Manuel Ugarte, who played under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, is not a starter. Instead Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes have been the team's midfield duo despite there being legitimate concerns over both men.",
      "Amorim has been open about his want to see more from the United academy graduate, who just over a year ago was starting in the Euro 2024 final. He said previously: \"I didn't have a conversation with him before the window closed because I didn't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having a conversation with him just to hold on to him. I did it this week.",
      "I believe in him a lot. He is a top player. But some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done [a complete player]. I think he can do so much better. For some guys [talent] is enough, but for him it is not. Maybe it's not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie and that's it.\"",

      "That much became clear after one Red Devils icon critiqued Amorim's decision not to re-hire one of his former team-mates. And it's not only past United players whose impression of the coach is changing.",
      "Rio Ferdinand didn't shy away from questioning Amorim's call to not employ former team-mate Ruud van Nistelrooy following his arrival at Old Trafford. And as fans look back upon the manager's first year in charge at the Theatre of Dreams, some may wonder if things would have shaped up any differently with the Dutchman on board.",
      "Van Nistelrooy previously made a positive impact on the squad as part of Erik ten Hag's backroom staff, then briefly led the team as interim manager following his countryman's dismissal. Amorim opted not to keep Van Nistelrooy on as he wanted to bring in his own staff, something that irked United great Ferdinand.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand said: \"His [Van Nistelrooy's] audition couldn’t have gone any better and I think, knowing him, there was a steely determination underneath that said, ‘I’m going to put myself in the best position, either to stay at the club in some capacity or someone else is going to say we need you as a manager.' He looked the part and he produced.",
      "\"The players needed that. We’re in a time where there was a lot of turbulence, the manager’s [Ten Hag’s] relationships with some players seemed fractured and irreversible, and the fans seemed to have made their minds up that that was it.",
      "\"And the new manager comes in – and you always get that bounce – but this seemed a bit different from a bounce. The players had grown to really like him, they appreciated how he informed them of different bits and pieces – tactically, individually, as a team – and there was a genuine ‘we want to do well for this guy.'\"",
      "Positive change can sometimes be found in the negatives. Amorim found that out first-hand when the United squad responded positively to him smashing up a TV screen in the dressing room following defeat to Brighton last season.",
      "For the most part, Amorim comes across as a composed character who is rarely flustered in front of the cameras. But that serenity has its limits, it seems, and the players found out just how furious their boss can get following a 3-1 loss at home to the Seagulls.",
      "But rather than recoil, it was reported that a number of United stars looked favourably upon the reaction. It emerged the outburst left many with a better impression of just how much Amorim cared about the club's results, even if his body language didn't always communicate it.",
      "His own version of Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer treatment had the intended impact of stirring some sense of fight within the playing staff. However, they'd perhaps do well to keep Amorim from trashing too many tellies, given United's current budget constraints.",
      "On the back of being named the Premier League's Player of the Month for October, it's evident Bryan Mbeumo is loving life in Manchester. And suffice to say, Ferdinand is loving what he's seen of the Cameroon international.",
      "With four goals in his last four games for United, there are few at Old Trafford who can rival the winger's current run of form. And Ferdinand was gushing in his praise of the attacker after he has helped pull United through their recent run of positive results.",
      "\"Mbeumo has been a joke,\" said the United icon on Rio Ferdinand Presents. \"He’s really stepped in there and become a mainstay. He’s someone who can give you two or three seconds on the ball to relieve pressure. He can score important goals and create chances.",
      "\"I saw Thomas Frank’s comments about him the other day, and Mbeumo nearly being a complete winger. I think by the end of this season, he’ll be one of the most complete wingers in the Premier League because he can do everything. He just needs to consistently do it in a United shirt.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe is reportedly seeking £1million in damages from his former club for allegedly harming his career. Tuanzebe, who now plays for Burnley, claims United are to blame for medical issues which he says continue to impact his career.",
      "The 27-year-old made 37 first-team appearances for United after coming through the club’s academy. He left at the end of the 2022/23 season upon the expiration of his contract and, following a two-year spell with Ipswich, joined Burnley in the summer.",
      "It emerged in July that Tuanzebe was filing a lawsuit against United for alleged “clinical negligence”. The Congolese international has struggled with injuries throughout his career and Sky News has now seen details of the allegations.",
      "Tuanzebe is reportedly alleging that United failed to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems. He claims he still cannot play \"without restriction or impediment\" due to the impact of the original injury.",
      "The lawsuit has now reportedly been lodged at the High Court in London and says Tuanzebe \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\". United refused to comment when contacted by Sky News.",
      "The case centres around stress fractures at the back of the spine, which Tuanzebe first picked up in January 2020 and which had allegedly become chronic by July 2022.",
      "The lawsuit argues: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment. As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It further states: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture. Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "Tuanzebe alleges he has been in \"significant pain and discomfort” since July 2022. His case is that his employers \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" in January 2020 when the stress fracture first occurred.",
      "The defender spent 17 years at United, having first joined the club as an eight-year-old. He came through the ranks in the academy, playing 38 times for the under-21s while being capped at youth level by England before later choosing to represent the country of his birth, DR Congo.",
      "Tuanzebe has made seven appearances in the Premier League and Carabao Cup for Burnley this season. After shaking off an injury, which saw him miss Burnley’s 3-2 defeat by United in August, he has started the last five league games for Scott Parker’s side.",

      "Ruben Amorim could push for Manchester United to extend Casemiro’s contract on one condition after being impressed by his performances this season. The veteran midfielder’s current deal is due to expire on June 30, but United have the option to extend it by 12 months.",
      "Casemiro was linked with a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia in the summer transfer window, but made it clear that he wanted to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place in Amorim’s side. The 33-year-old, who cost £70million from Real Madrid in 2022, has done just that, re-establishing himself as Amorim’s first-choice in central midfield.",
      "He has been crucial to United this season, returning three goals and one assist in 10 Premier League appearances. His form has also helped revitalise his international career with Brazil, where his former Real manager Carlo Ancelotti has been similarly impressed.",
      "Casemiro was handed a contract worth around £350,000-a-week when he joined United over three years ago. And his sky-high wages have often been used as an argument for letting him go when his deal expires in the summer.",
      "But his efforts this season are earning him plenty of supporters inside the club, not least with Amorim himself, who talkSPORT says is considering keeping him for another year. Casemiro is a hugely popular member of the squad and his experience and leadership qualities have been crucial in the team’s upturn in form of late.",
      "Amorim would reportedly support a contract extension for Casemiro, who turns 34 in February, provided he agrees to take a pay cut. Asked about his performances after the 4-2 win over Brighton last month, Amorim said: “I think he gives a lot of experience. He's an example for everyone.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer], but he fought and he worked, and now he's back in the national team. He's so important for us.”",
      "Amorim was asked about Casemiro’s situation before the draw with Tottenham on the weekend. He said: “Yeah, we don’t know what is going to happen. My goal is to continue to count with Casemiro, with Harry Maguire, that he has the same problem.",
      "“I don’t know what is going to happen. Let’s focus on this season. I’m really happy with Casemiro, he is really important. I’m really happy with Harry, but I know what you guys are asking, let’s focus on this season and then we’ll see the next season.”",
      "And Casemiro has addressed his plans too. “Football is my life, right? So it’s inevitable [to continue],” he said. “But I think my wife and family will want some time for themselves, yes.",
      "“I’m one of those who think that in life you have to have a plan. But I’m into short-term goals. Of course, it’s inevitable to think about being in good shape for a World Cup, but you can’t expect to be in good shape for the World Cup if you’re not doing well at Manchester United.”",

      "Manchester United's squad rallied behind Tyrell Malacia's return to first-team training last month, following the Dutch left-back's stint in Ruben Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad'. The 26-year-old, who had expressed his wish to leave Old Trafford in the summer, was one of five players who made their intentions clear.",
      "Malacia found it difficult to secure regular playing time after recovering from a severe knee injury and spent the second half of the previous season on loan at PSV. Despite pushing for a move during the off-season, he failed to secure a transfer, unlike teammates Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Dutch defender was the sole survivor of the 'bomb squad' at United post the summer transfer window, leading to Amorim's decision to reintegrate him into the first-team setup. He was spotted back in senior training on October 1 and later named as a substitute for the Brighton match that month.",
      "As per The Athletic, United's players fully supported Amorim's decision to bring Malacia back into the mix, and the head coach took this feedback on board when selecting the squad for the Brighton game.",
      "Malacia joined United in a £13million deal from Feyenoord in July 2022, marking Erik ten Hag's inaugural signing as the Red Devils' boss. He quickly became a key player in Ten Hag's team during his debut season, making 39 appearances across all competitions and contributing to the Reds' Carabao Cup victory.",
      "However, in the summer of 2023, Malacia was sidelined for a year and a half after undergoing knee surgery. He made his much-anticipated return for the Under-21s in the EFL Trophy in November 2024, and later that month, he also featured in the Europa League match against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "Despite this, Malacia's time on the pitch at United was limited, leading him to decide to go out on loan to get more game time during the second half of the 2024/25 season. Indeed, he joined PSV on loan in February.",
      "During his stint at PSV, he made 11 appearances, including two against Arsenal in the Champions League, and helped the club secure the Eredivisie title for the second consecutive season.",
      "After his loan spell at PSV ended in the summer, Malacia returned to United but has not played any competitive football since. He was named in the United matchday squad once for the Brighton game on October 25, but remained on the bench.",

      "Currently, 15 members of the squad will not be at Carrington for the next few days as Manchester United gear up for the home game against Everton on Monday, 24 November. Saturday's late 2-2 draw with Tottenham means that United will be aiming to extend their five-match unbeaten streak.",
      "While Amorim and his staff will have a reduced squad over the international break, it does provide them with an opportunity to work more closely with the players who have remained behind. Most have simply been omitted from their respective national squads for the upcoming fixtures.",
      "However, there is one significant injury worry for United with striker Benjamin Sesko withdrawing from the Slovenia squad due to a knee injury he sustained in the draw against Spurs. Sesko will continue to be assessed at United this week but it is believed that the injury is not a serious one,",
      "There was also an injury scare over Casemiro. The midfielder was substituted against Tottenham, but, as it stands he is still set to link up with the Brazil squad.",
      "One player who won't be with the club, but is not expected to feature in international games is defender Lisandro Martinez. He has just returned to training with United as he steps up his recovery from a major knee injury.",
      "He's set to link up with the Argentina team for training, despite not being named in the squad for the upcoming international fixtures.",
      "A total of 11 players, including Sesko, will remain at United during the break. He's likely to use this time to recover from his injury and could be joined by defender Harry Maguire, who was the third player to be pulled out against Spurs.",
      "The England centre-back wasn't selected for Thomas Tuchel's squad for the matches against Serbia and Albania, meaning he can undergo any necessary rehab at Carrington.",
      "Four other England internationals will stay at United after not being selected for the squad. Luke Shaw, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Tom Heaton will all be focusing on the Everton match and working more closely with Amorim.",
      "They'll be joined by young talents Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi who will all aim to impress in a bid to break into the first team squad. Tyrell Malacia and Joshua Zirkzee will also be around the squad over the international break after not being called up to the Netherlands squad.",
      "The smaller squad could provide an opportunity for some other young players to join in with first-team training to boost the numbers working with Amorim and his coaching staff. As for those away on international duty, United will be keeping a close eye on their progress, hoping they return fit and healthy.",

      "Zirkzee has made five appearances this term and been on the pitch for just 90 minutes after United strengthened their forward options in the summer. After the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Zirkzee has found himself well down the pecking order.",
      "Last month, West Ham were noted to be preparing a loan offer for the forward, undeterred by United's reluctance to part ways. Everton are now said to be targeting a forward in January and could provide some competition.",

      "Doubts have been raised over whether Alejandro Garnacho can continue his fine form for Chelsea despite John Terry praising his \"petrifying\" ability. The 21-year-old endured a challenging start to the season after spending two of the Blues' first five matches across all competitions on the bench.",
      "However, the Argentine has since established himself as Enzo Maresca's first-choice left winger, scoring two goals and providing two assists in his last four appearances. Garnacho has earned plaudits for his recent performances, with Chelsea legend Terry hailing his star turn in last Saturday's 3-0 win over Wolves, where he provided assists for both Malo Gusto and Pedro Neto.",
      "As per the Metro, the former England captain said: \"[It's] absolutely petrifying as a defender when you're facing someone that quick and that direct. He gives us something the other wingers don’t as well. That's what you want to see as a Chelsea fan - players like that beating players. It doesn't always have to be with loads of skill.\"",
      "Garnacho's upturn in form could potentially leave Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim red-faced after completing his £40million move from Old Trafford to Chelsea in August. The switch occurred following Garnacho's spat with Amorim over his limited game time in the Europa League final.",
      "However, ex-United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster has questioned how long he will be able to sustain his current level of performance. The retired shot-stopper questioned Garnacho's mentality and suggested he could struggle against better teams, with players waiting in the wings to take his starting place at Chelsea.",
      "Discussing Garnacho's display against Wolves on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"He looked really sharp and looked really nice to be fair. He was really good and maybe he needed that as a little bit of a springboard. But with that Chelsea team, I just don't know who's going to start.",
      "\"They've got so many players who can play in those sorts of positions that it's really hard for a player to get a string of games and a run of form. He needs a bit of an arm around him and for someone to go, 'You're going to start the next six games and you're going to be my best player.'",
      "\"The ability is there and the talent is there, but I think most of the time it's in his head. He's going to come up against much bigger, better, faster and stronger opposition than Wolves.\"",
      "While Foster is unsure of Garnacho's long-term credentials, Chelsea's head coach was left impressed by what he saw against Wolves.",
      "Speaking after the final whistle, Maresca said: \"He's doing very well on the ball, but he's doing very, very well off the ball. He knows that to play with us, he has to be good on the ball and off the ball; otherwise, he's not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "Alan Shearer also highlighted his display on Match of the Day, saying: \"I think it was his best game today. He caused problems all evening down the left-hand side. Whoever was coming up against him, he had more pace than them.",

      "A statement from the FA on Tuesday read: “Burnley's Hannibal Mejbri has been charged with misconduct following their Premier League fixture against Leeds United on Saturday 18 October. It's alleged that the player acted in breach of the Laws of the Game and/or in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or indecent behaviour by spitting at or in the direction of Leeds United supporters around the 67th minute. Hannibal Mejbri has until Friday 28 November to provide a response.”",

We are currently working with Burnley Football Club to establish the facts.\"",

      "Manchester United have set their sights on Nottingham Forest midfielder, Elliot Anderson. The 23-year-old has emerged as a prime target for Ruben Amorim's side, who are keen to bolster their central midfield.",
      "Anderson joined Forest from Newcastle United last summer in a hefty £35million deal. In his debut season at the City Ground, he made a whopping 42 appearances across all competitions, playing a pivotal role in Forest's seventh-place finish in the Premier League and their journey to the FA Cup semi-finals.",
      "Despite Forest's lacklustre start to the 2025/26 season, Anderson's performance has been consistently stellar. After an exceptional first season with Forest, he earned his maiden call-up to the England senior squad in August. He has since shone in a Three Lions shirt, starting four matches against Andorra, Serbia, Wales and Latvia.",
      "Forest have been notified about United's intention to pursue the Whitley Bay-born star, but the Reds are expected to demand a staggering fee of at least £100m, if not closer to £120m. If United manage to secure Anderson for that price, or even higher, it would smash the club's transfer record, currently held by Paul Pogba's £89m switch from Juventus to United in 2016.",
      "Such a colossal move would be a game-changer for Ruben Amorim and United, but the club might need to generate funds through player sales before they can splash out nine figures on Anderson.",
      "So, how could they raise the necessary cash? A good starting point would be to review the players currently out on loan and assess if any of them could fetch a hefty fee. At present, Marcus Rashford seems the most likely candidate for a sale next summer.",
      "The 28-year-old moved to Barcelona on a season-long loan in July and has been in fine form for the La Liga side, netting six goals and setting up nine more in 16 appearances across all competitions. Barcelona, who are footing Rashford's £8m salary for the season, have an option to buy him for £26m at the end of his loan spell.",
      "If Barca's finances allow, this deal appears highly probable at this stage, providing United with a tidy profit. Another potential sale is Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Danish striker has found the back of the net four times in 10 games since joining Napoli on loan in August, and Antonio Conte's team have the option to make his move permanent for £38m next summer. If United can secure that amount for the ex-Atalanta player, it would provide a welcome boost to their Anderson war chest.",
      "Jadon Sancho, the third high-profile United player currently on loan, was loaned to Aston Villa in the summer. Although Villa don't have an option to buy the 25-year-old, his long-term future at Old Trafford seems uncertain. With a valuation of £20m, selling him could be the best solution.",
      "Andre Onana, is spending the season away from Manchester after a late move to Turkish side Trabzonspor. Despite United paying £47.5m for the 29-year-old Cameroon international from Inter Milan in 2023, he's now valued at £26m, with United likely to get around £15m for him.",
      "Selling Rashford, Hojlund, Sancho and Onana could bring in at least £85m, if not more, meaning United would only need a small amount more to afford Anderson. However, United could sell a prized asset not just to afford Anderson but also to gain funds to strengthen other areas of the team.",
      "Cashing in on Kobbie Mainoo could enable the Red Devils to achieve that. The 20-year-old has been limited to just 138 minutes of Premier League football this season, raising concerns about his future at United, with Chelsea among others showing interest.",
      "Mainoo is valued at around £45m, and while that might seem low for his age and potential, United might need to sell him just to make room for Anderson in the squad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo believes he has one or two years left in the game and says the 2026 World Cup finals will “definitely” be his last.",
      "The 40-year-old Portugal international was asked about his future in an interview via video link at the TOURISE Riyadh event on Tuesday, having told Piers Morgan Uncensored last week he would retire “soon”. He initially joked on Tuesday that “soon” meant “in 10 years” before adding: “When I mean soon…. I’m really enjoying the moment right now. As you know in football, when you reach some age you count the months very quick.",
      "“So, the moment is good, I feel very good in this moment, I score goals, I still feel quick and sharp, I’m enjoying my game in the national team and Al Nassr, but of course, let’s be honest, when I mean ‘soon’ it’s probably one, two years I’ll still be in the game.”",
      "Asked if that meant the 2026 World Cup would be his last, he replied: “Definitely, yes, because I will be 41 years old and I think it will be the moment, and in a big competition.",
      "“As I told you before, I am enjoying the moment, but when I mean soon, it’s really soon because I give everything for football, I’m in the game for the last 25 years, I did everything, I have many records in the different scenarios in the clubs and also in the national team – I’m really proud.",
      "“So let’s enjoy the moment and live the moment.”",
      "The World Cup remains the biggest trophy to have so far eluded Ronaldo throughout an illustrious career, having won the Euros with Portugal in 2016. Ronaldo signed a new two-year contract with Al Nassr in June. Piers Morgan asked Ronaldo in an interview which aired last week when he would retire.",
      "“Soon. But I think I will be prepared,” Ronaldo said. “It will be tough, of course. It will be difficult? Yes. Probably (I) will cry, yes… I’m (an) open person. (It) will be very, very difficult, yes.”",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens has been praised for the calm way in which he's established himself as Manchester United's first-choice goalkeeper. Eyebrows were initially raised when the young Belgian shot-stopper was signed from Royal Antwerp in a £18.2million deal on transfer deadline day on September 1.",
      "The 23-year-old was viewed as an unknown quantity when he arrived at Old Trafford without having earned a single senior cap for Belgium. However, Andre Onana headed into the campaign with major doubts over his abilities whilst Altay Bayindir had also not convinced.",
      "After one too many errors from Onana saw him sent on loan to Turkish club Trabzonspor, United head coach Ruben Amorim soon turned to Lammens. He has seized the opportunity with both hands after keeping a clean sheet on his debut against Sunderland and with the Red Devils currently unbeaten in their last five games.",
      "Former United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster believes that upturn in form can partly be attributed to the confidence displayed by Lammens between the sticks. His conviction in his own strengths stands in stark contrast to Onana, who appeared drained of any self-belief by the time he left.",
      "Discussing Lammens' performances during an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"I didn't know what to expect at the beginning. It's a massive step up and you need somebody with a bit of authority and a bit of an aura about them to step into that Manchester United team.",
      "\"But he's done it so far with absolute ease and he's got this confidence about him. He's coming out for balls into the box, where you're normally talking about seriously seasoned Premier League goalies that do this kind of stuff and he's doing it from the get-go.",
      "\"It still remains to be seen whether he's got the X factor and the little bits that turn a good goalie into a great goalkeeper. Whether Senne Lammens has that in his game remains to be seen.\"",
      "Foster was initially cynical about Lammens' arrival after previously claiming it would take a \"miracle\" for the signing to be successful. However, he has since revised his opinion based on the keeper's assured displays in goal.",
      "United legend Rio Ferdinand has also waxed lyrical about Lammens' contribution, with Amorim's side currently seventh in the Premier League after their dramatic 2-2 draw at Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "He said on his YouTube channel: \"You can't talk about anyone being our most important player without mentioning the goalkeeper. It's no coincidence we've had an upturn in form. We've got a goalkeeper that it seems all the players trust.\"",
      "Lammens was recently branded as \"boring\" by some United fans on social media as a compliment after he turned up for Belgium national duty in beige clothing. It's a label the keeper himself is only too happy to embrace as he aims to become known for his consistency.",
      "\"I understand I might come across as 'boring' but that's the goalkeeper I want to be,\" he told Belgian publication HLN. \"I don't do anything crazy. In recent years, players have come through here who...weren't boring. But I want to stand for consistency. Staying calm, in good times and bad.",
      "\"If you want a successful career, you have to have that quality, I think. I saw that in Simon Mignolet (at Club Brugge) and Jean Butez (at Antwerp). They were my role models. I was able to steal from them with my eyes.\"",

      "Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha has rubbished suggestions that £28million represents a steal for Barcelona to land Marcus Rashford permanently. The England forward was loaned out to the Catalan club for the season after Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim decided he wasn't part of his plans.",
      "Barcelona have secured an option to make the switch permanent for £28m come 2026, with multiple reports in Spain claiming they're already plotting to secure an agreement with United. Rashford has been a revelation since arriving in Spain, bagging six goals and providing nine assists in all competitions whilst wearing the famous Blaugrana strip.",
      "The 28-year-old currently leads the way for assists among players across Europe's elite divisions. However, Saha - who enjoyed a four-year stint at Old Trafford - isn't convinced that Barca's £28m buy-out clause represents outstanding value given Rashford's recent troubles at United.",
      "\"I think Marcus Rashford does provide a bit of worry,\" he said via OLBG. \"You have to manage him. What happened to him at United?\".",
      "\"I think something could happen again so I think that he has to have his own objective. I think he needs to come back to that level and maintain that to be in the World Cup and win it. That's what I hope for him.",
      "\"But yes, it's not a bargain because of what he went through in a really tough moment. He didn't play well for two years. He had a lot of issues.",
      "\"Now they are solved and it's not solved because of United, just because he is in a new environment. I think he managed to get back to the basics, which is good for him.\"",
      "The United academy graduate has already made his stance on Barcelona clear - expressing a desire to stay at the club for many years. \"I'm really enjoying my time in Spain; the weather is the best,\" he said.",

      "They say you never lose it - and that's what Wythenshawe Vets are counting on with their star-studded over-35s squad, packed with Premier League cult heroes.",
      "You may've seen clips on social media showing ex-Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse score EIGHT goals in their 13-0 win against South Liverpool on Sunday. The match was played in their humble surroundings of Hollyhedge Park in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester.",
      "It's a far cry from the arenas that the 10 former Premier League players on their books once played in front of, but they love it all the same. The Vets boast combined 1,867 Premier League appearances, 389 international caps and 15 major honours in their ranks - as well as plenty of flash cars seen on a matchday.",
      "Stephen Ireland, Emile Heskey, Maynor Figueroa, Joleon Lescott, Oumar Niasse, Nedum Onuoha, George Boyd, Danny Drinkwater and Jefferson Montero have turned out in the Cheshire Vets League Premier Division alongside Cisse. The players pay £15 per month in subs and ex-Leicester and Chelsea midfielder Drinkwater believes that it's 'just as enjoyable as playing in the Premier League'.",
      "\"You do a token 10-minute warmup, you're having a laugh and you have a pint afterwards - it's as good as it's going to get,\" he added. \"The values are obviously different in professional football, but you can enjoy it just as much.",
      "\"It's like estate football, which is what you enjoyed as a kid. There's loads of banter. I was chuckling away on the pitch today.\"",
      "The team came together after ex-Manchester City midfielder Ireland, who's close friends Wythenshawe player Blake Norton, fancied a game on a Sunday. Ireland had been playing 'low-key' seven-a-side matches alongside some fellow former pros on Tuesday nights.",
      "\"I came down in pre-season just because I love playing football,\" he explained. \"I love the fitness side of things. I invited some of the others and slowly but surely everyone wants to play. It's competitive and it's going from strength to strength.",
      "\"I didn't want it to be something where 15 of us ex-pros came in and took over, I want a good mix with the old vets lads. It's a nice humbling experience to interact with fans as well. It's great to give back and the club have been so nice to me. We're all local as well.\"",
      "And now a bigger superstar could be about to join them.",
      "According to the Mail, none other than Wayne Rooney is keen to get involved. The ex-England captain and Manchester United legend is currently filling his diary with media appearances, but he's frequently played in charity matches such as Soccer Aid.",
      "\"Imagine that, that would be unreal. Rooney in the No.10 slot, wouldn't be bad that,\" Drinkwater quipped.",
      "Ireland says that they've had feverish interest, revealing: \"My phone hasn't stopped! I've got people going, 'how do I get involved, how do I sign up?'",
      "\"I just want to be wary of not bringing too many people, because I want it to be a mix of the proper old vets with maybe four or five pros each time. But it is great fun, even as an incentive during the week to prepare for it. That's what it's like now.\"",
      "The club also have a history with Man United - and there's a smidge of bad blood. In 1956, Wythenshawe AFC drew 1-1 with United in the Whitaker Cup Final against a side that included Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "The match ended after extra-time and the cup was shared, with both clubs 'agreeing' to hold it for six months each. According to a Wythenshawe official, though, United didn't upheld their end of the bargain and kept hold of it for the full year.",
      "It's also been reported the UFC icon Conor McGregor is attempting to sort out a match involving Wythenshawe in Dublin next month. Could the crowds of hundreds one-day be thousands?",
      "\"Ultimately, we're a community‑owned club and this is highlighting what we do in the area,\" chairman Carl Barratt. \"For what Stevie Ireland has done, because he's been the catalyst to get people involved along with Kieran (Megran, manager), it's been superb.",
      "\"Wythenshawe is not the most affluent area but hopefully this can contribute to us getting more players, generating more money and the feel-good factor around the place … you can just sense it.\"",

      "Andy Burnham has reiterated \"not a penny of public money\" will be granted to construct Manchester United's new stadium.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the project could be completed by 2030.",
      "Ratcliffe floated the idea of taxpayers partly funding the £2billion project, saying: \"People in the north pay their taxes and there is an argument you could think about a more ambitious project in the north which would be fitting for England, for the Champions League final or the FA Cup final.\"",
      "Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has previously stated that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, and he reiterated that stance to The Added Time Podcast.",
      "However, a Mayoral Development Corporation has recently been established for the regeneration project surrounding the stadium, which will bring huge economic benefits.",
      "Burnham said: \"It's not about giving them money because we have a really clear principle here at the start of this journey with the Mayoral Development Corporation. Manchester United will be paying for the stadium. There will not be a penny of public money going into that.",
      "\"But we have absolutely a role to play in making everything around the stadium as good as it can be because of the economic benefit that brings. If you think about it, there is a train station behind the stand there and it's not been used for a number of years for safety reasons.",
      "\"Part of it would see that station relocated a little bit, maybe a bit nearer Lou Macari's chippy or somewhere near there, and that would then reopen and massively benefit existing communities, Gorse Hill, Stretford and the people who live there, so the public benefit of this would be massive.",
      "\"Thousands of new homes, thousands of new jobs, so it's much wider than the ground itself.\"",
      "Burnham confirmed the aim of bringing the 2035 World Cup final to Manchester, saying: “I am closely involved to the point where we’ve just asked parliament to establish a Mayoral Development Corporation. So that is a vehicle, a legal entity, that will oversee the wider regeneration of the whole area.",
      "“That is more my responsibility, the wider environment around any new stadium. It’s a huge opportunity for us as a city and a region. If you think about that area, it’s the area around the old Salford docks.",
      "“You’ve got Media City on the other side. This could be a global location if we get it right. I know people here kind of struggle to see why it impacts life on this end of the M62 [Liverpool], but actually there are freight terminals behind the existing Old Trafford that send lots of trains through Manchester city centre.",
      "\"That is a major cause of the chaos on railways across the north because it causes blockages in Manchester. Therefore, every train coming across the country is often then late getting over to Liverpool.",
      "\"So it’s a project that actually makes sense on loads of levels. It actually would lead to the freight tunnels being relocated to St Helens and therefore growth here [Liverpool].",
      "\"It’s a major growth project for the whole of the north west. And the enticing prospect in my mind is if we really get it moving, I think there’s a fairly high likelihood that we will be hosting the women’s FIFA World Cup in 2035.",
      "\"Imagine a final at that new Old Trafford. It would be quite something, wouldn't it?\"",
      "The design of the new stadium has been paused while discussions progress regarding the acquisition of land. The rail yard surrounding Old Trafford is owned by Freightliner and that land is crucial to the plans.",
      "United are optimistic of agreeing a deal to acquire the land for new stadium project.",

      "Manchester United's fixture schedule is about to get a lot busier after the international break.",
      "United failed to qualify for European football and crashed out of the Carabao Cup at the second round stage, which means Ruben Amorim has overseen one game per week for most of the season.",
      "That will change in December due to the festive Premier League calendar. It is famously a challenging month and United will play six games, double the number played in August, September and October.",
      "United begin the month against West Ham at Old Trafford on December 4 and the Reds will play Wolves away five days later. Bournemouth come next on December 13, United will travel to Aston Villa on December 21, and Newcastle visit on Boxing Day.",
      "The month will end with another game against Wolves - this time at home. The festive period can make-or-break a season, and Amorim will be desperate for his players to continue their recent momentum.",
      "United are undefeated in their last five matches and will play Everton and Crystal Palace before the end of December, so there is an opportunity for that record to remain intact.",
      "The busier fixture list will pose different challenges, though. Amorim picked an unchanged team for the first time in the Premier League against Brighton and he has settled on regular starters.",
      "Luke Shaw, Bruno Fernandes, Matthijs de Ligt and Bryan Mbeumo have all started every league game this season, while Amad, Mathues Cunha and Casemiro are the next players with the most minutes recorded.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad will travel to the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Cameroon and the Ivory Coast respectively near the end of December, and there are question marks around whether Shaw and Casemiro will be able to deal with the increased workload for different reasons.",
      "United have planned with Amad and Mbeumo going to AFCON in mind, but it would be a blow to lose Shaw to injury, or for Casemiro's performance level to drop, which is possible due to the congested fixture list.",
      "If you ignore the defeat in the Manchester derby, Shaw has enjoyed a strong campaign and was unfortunate not to be recalled to the England squad for the November international break.",
      "He wants to play for his country, although United fans were pleased with Thomas Tuchel's decision given the 30-year-old has benefited from playing one game per week so far this season. Shaw has tended to pick up muscle injuries and little niggles in the past due to playing two matches in seven days, but he has maintained a clean bill of health thanks to the kinder fixture schedule.",
      "You only need to look at Shaw's medical history to conclude that he may end up facing a spell on the sidelines during the winter schedule - more games mean a higher chance of injury.",
      "Shaw has been excellent on the left side of the back three. Lisandro Martinez is set to return imminently from a knee injury, but he will be missed if he picks up an injury this winter.",
      "On the other hand, Casemiro has demonstrated durability and should be able to physically cope with the increased workload, but whether he can maintain his current performance level is another matter.",
      "United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch this season and 15 when he has been off it. The Brazilian has enjoyed an unexpected renaissance during 2025 after falling down the pecking order, but will he be able to sustain those displays playing two games per week?",
      "Casemiro's renaissance was sparked by his performances in the Europa League last term. He was more suited to the pace of the competition, but he struggled when he played in the league.",
      "The 33-year-old has transferred his European form into the Premier League this season but playing two weeks per week in December will pose different questions for him.",
      "Amorim will be hoping Shaw remains fit and Casemiro can sustain his current level. United are guaranteed to lose Mbeumo and Amad, so they could do without another two key players losing their places.",

      "You probably don't know much about Manchester United striker Enzo Kana-Biyik.",
      "He was a low-key arrival in the summer window, arriving from Le Havre on a free transfer before immediately joining FC Lausanne Sport on a season-long loan.",
      "The youngster is following in the footsteps of Paul Pogba, who also joined United as a teenager from Le Havre. Kana-Biyik will be a huge success if he achieves a fraction of what Pogba has during his career.",
      "Kana-Biyik celebrated his 18th birthday in January and had entered the final year of his contract. United were proactive and took advantage of the situation by signing him for nothing.",
      "United released a statement which read: \"Manchester United have completed the signing of exciting young forward Enzo Kana-Biyik. Last season, the France youth international scored nine goals in 18 games for Le Havre's Under-19s team and earned a place on the bench for the first team on two occasions.",
      "\"Following the signing of his contract, the emerging talent has secured a loan switch to Swiss Super League side, Lausanne-Sport. Everyone at United would like to welcome Enzo to the club.\"",
      "The decision to send Kana-Biyik to Ineos-owned Lausanne wasn't a surprise because playing academy football with the Under-21s this term wouldn't have helped his development",
      "Kana-Biyik did not make a senior appearance for Le Havre, but spent plenty of time training with their first-team and United decided a loan was the best option for the next stage of his career.",
      "U21 boss Travis Binnion and former academy director Nick Cox visited Lausanne's facilities, and the Swiss club are expected to sign more United players on loan in the coming years.",
      "Kana-Biyik is the first United player to have been loaned to Lausanne as part of that Ineos relationship, but he encountered bad luck after his arrival when he suffered a \"severe knee sprain\" during training.",
      "The youngster subsequently missed the start of the campaign but returned to action earlier than expected and has made 10 appearances for Lausanne so far this season.",
      "Last weekend, Kana-Biyik scored his first senior goal to equalise against FC Sion. He salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby, when he was given ample space in the box and finished into the bottom right corner like any striker worth their salt would.",
      "\"It's beautiful, it feels good. I feel a bit liberated,\" Kana-Biyik told Swiss outlet Blick when he spoke after the game. \"It was the first thing that came to mind [showing the name on his shirt as he celebrated]. The most important thing was to celebrate with my teammates and the fans.\"",
      "Despite scoring his first goal for Lausanne, Kana-Biyik was substituted at half-time. \"I feel like I'm answering Enzo. He asked me the same question,\" laughed Lausanne coach Peter Zeidler.",
      "Zeidler explained Kana-Biyik was \"disappointed\" and \"didn't want to believe it,\" but said he accepted the decision and described the youngster as a \"good person.\"",
      "Zeidler continued: \"Coming back, starting, and scoring in a derby at La Tuilière, that's revenge. I hope he'll score more goals.\"",
      "United's social media channels have shared Kana-Biyik's goal for Laussanne and he responded by reposting on his Instagram. Having an affiliation with the biggest club in England will rocket his follower count.",
      "The United website has noted Kana-Biyik has received a call-up to the France Under-19 squad for games against the Faroe Islands, Bulgaria and Hungary during the international break.",
      "Kana-Biyik has a lot to learn, but United signed him because they believe he possesses first-team potential, and he will be hoping to get an audition to impress Ruben Amorim at the end of the season.",
      "The 18-year-old will earmark pre-season as the opportunity to state his case to remain at United, although it's likely another loan could be on the cards for the 2026/2027 campaign.",
      "It's also possible that Kana-Biyik never plays for United and is eventually flipped for profit. The Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have impacted transfers and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of simply making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea or Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "Kana-Biyik will be hoping to represent United at Old Trafford in the future, though.",

      "Manchester United find themselves in a predicament when it comes to deciding Casemiro's future.",
      "On the one hand, the Brazilian has managed to become an integral part of Ruben Amorim's team this season. We have said time and time again that United look worse when the midfielder is not on the pitch.",
      "Full credit goes to Casemiro for this. Last season he looked like he would never return to a point where he could perform week in, week out, in the Premier League.",
      "And yet, here we are witnessing his renaissance. But on the other hand, the 33-year-old is not getting any younger. He is one of United's highest paid players and that is a problem in itself. The Reds are not guaranteed to have European football next season and it is understood they are reluctant to extend Casemiro's stay if he does not agree to a new contract on lower terms.",
      "That being said, there is a lack of quality defensive midfielders in world football who possess those skills, but also don't cost the Earth. United were quoted £100m for Carlos Baleba in the summer - that is the market the Reds are having to operate in.",
      "Whichever way you look at it, it is a headache for United. A further complication was added to the mix on Tuesday after Casemiro's interview with O Globo was published.",
      "\"Football is my life, right? So it's inevitable [to continue],\" he said when asked about his future beyond this season.",
      "\"But I think my wife and family will want some time for themselves, yes. I'm one of those who think that in life you have to have a plan.",
      "\"But I'm into short-term goals. Of course, it's inevitable to think about being in good shape for a World Cup, but you can't expect to be in good shape for the World Cup if you're not doing well at Manchester United.\"",
      "Reading between the lines, it seems that Casemiro is wanting to know, one way or the other, where his future lies beyond this season, soon. This throws up a conundrum for United.",
      "United must decide whether or not he is worthy of a new contract and that decision will have far reaching consequences on United's future transfer spending.",

      "It claimed United would like to reduce his wages, but Casemiro seems unwilling to accept a pay cut. Having not lost since late September, United headed into the latest international break on a high, especially after their late fightback against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "However, the one negative from the 2-2 draw at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was the early departure of Benjamin Sesko. The MEN understands that Sesko will continue to be assessed at Carrington this week, but sources have indicated the injury is not thought to be a major issue.",

      "Aston Villa also had a buy option during Rashford’s loan spell at Villa Park, although their clause was worth £40m. Despite a positive spell at the club, Unai Emery’s side chose not to activate it, with PSR issues proving to be a problem for the Midlands club.",

      "Since his move to the Middle East, Toney has scored 41 goals and provided eight assists in 59 appearances. With the ex-Peterborough man netting 11 of those in 15 matches this season, talk has increased that he could be set for a move back to English football.",
      "Toney is thought to be considering a return to the Premier League following his exit from Brentford last summer. It's added that numerous top-flight clubs have made enquires about a January deal, with Everton and Tottenham among those interested.",
      "While there is no specific mention of United's name in the report, the Reds wanted Toney before he went to Saudi Arabia. After impressing for Gareth Southgate's England at Euro 2024, the Old Trafford club considered Toney as a striker option as they tried to strengthen their front line.",

      "\"For me, for my dad who is the biggest United fan, seeing him be so proud… when he comes he is like a kid in the candy store and it is awesome to live out a dream that he wishes that he could have had the opportunity to do.\"",
      "The opportunity in question for Riviere tonight is particularly special. Marc Skinner's side will host PSG in the Champions League at Old Trafford for the very first time.",
      "The significance of this moment is not lost on the 24-year-old. \"Just touching on that trajectory of women’s football, for us, we want this to be a stepping stone onto something that is going to be a consistent thing every year,\" she said.",
      "\"To be able to play in big stadiums like Old Trafford, to invite an opponent such as PSG into our atmosphere is, I think, going to be something really unique. Obviously the girls and I are buzzing about it.",
      "\"There are some differences [in playing at Old Trafford compared to Leigh Sports Village]. It brings more pressure but also more excitement because you know you are going to get a great crowd, you know it will be a bigger stadium.",
      "\"For me personally, I can speak for myself that Old Trafford is the Theatre of Dreams for a reason so any time you step on that pitch, you think about the people and I think about my father who would have [loved] the opportunity, if he could, to run up and down that pitch if he were, God willing, given it. When I play at a stadium like Old Trafford, I am representing more than just myself.",
      "\"For the team to play PSG, who we have also played before when we had the opportunity, we wasn’t able to reach our goal that season, I think it is amazing to have them be in one of the best stadiums, in Manchester, and be able to put on a show.\"",
      "Now retired, Riviere's father served his country's navy before becoming a superintendent in the police force. \"He’s been over a lot of times,\" the defender says with a smile.",
      "\"He literally tries to catch every single women’s or men’s game he can. He will make the trek down a few times throughout the year which is really nice and he just loves it every single time.\"",
      "United's unbeaten start to the season in all competitions ended on Saturday lunchtime as they lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Leigh Sports Village. In the Champions League though, the Reds are one of just five teams to have won both of their opening matches in the competition.",
      "PSG, who have Mary Earps in their dressing room, have lost their opening two games so tonight is seen as a good opportunity to seal another three points in their bid to qualify for the knockout stages. Last time out, United overcame adversity to defeat Atletico Madrid 1-0 in Spain.",
      "Both sides finished the game with ten players after Dominique Janssen and Alexia Fernandez Diaz were sent off for United and Atleti respectively. Reflecting on that game, Riviere insists that her teammates have learnt some valuable lessons which they can take into the clash with PSG.",
      "\"We were buzzing,\" she explained when asked about the dressing room response to the win. \"It was a challenge we haven’t been presented with.",
      "\"Going down to ten men, you always know that if you go down to ten men, this is what you do, but you never really touch on it to that extent and you never think it is going to happen. But for Dom [Janssen] to get the red card, we know Dom and she never has any malicious intent at all.",
      "\"It felt like we needed to rally for her because she is a fighter on our team and is someone who wants to play in the Champions League. For us, it also shed light on the versatility we have on our team.",
      "\"Having to go from this attacking, pressing team to actually having to invite pressure but also create transitional opportunities. It was a unique game for us to say the least, but we were buzzing to get three points from that.\"",
      "Kick-off against PSG in United's first Champions League game at Old Trafford is 8pm tonight and tickets can be purchased on United's website or at the stadium."

      "\"He is doing that really well because that is a smart thing for a player. But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",

      "Ivan Toney is open to a Premier League return in January amid speculation around a potential move to Manchester United. The 29-year-old has spent the last 15 months in Saudi Arabia after he left Brentford to sign for Al-Ahli in August 2024.",
      "Since his move to the Middle East, Toney has scored 41 goals and provided eight assists in 59 appearances. With the ex-Peterborough man netting 11 of those in 15 matches this season, talk has increased that he could be set for a move back to English football.",
      "While there is no specific mention of United's name in the report, the Reds wanted Toney before he went to Saudi Arabia. After impressing for Gareth Southgate's England at Euro 2024, the Old Trafford club considered Toney as a striker option as they tried to strengthen their front line.",
      "Although nothing came to fruition with Toney and Joshua Zirkzee arrived instead, United now could do with him to ease the burden on summer signing Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old Slovenia international has scored just twice in 12 appearances since his £73.7million move to the Reds from RB Leizpig.",
      "Toney scored 36 times in 83 top-flight appearances for Brentford before making the £40m move to Al-Ahli in 2024. His most prolific Premier League campaign came in 2022/23 when he netted 20 in 33 matches, with only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (36) and Tottenham's Harry Kane (30) finding the net more often.",
      "Explaining his decision to swap Brentford for the Saudi Pro League, Toney said in December 2024: \"I came here and the training ground was good, the stadium was nice and the quality in the team was good also. People look at this league differently, but I stepped into it knowing it's still a high standard.",
      "\"I wanted something a bit different. It's a different culture, but I can blend in anywhere. I've been at Peterborough, Brentford, now out of the UK. I'm excited to be on this journey.",
      "\"I believe it's the right move at this stage of my career.\"",
      "Following an excellent debut season at Al-Ahli, where he scored 30 times in 44 games, Toney earned himself a recall to the England squad in the summer. It marked his first call-up since Thomas Tuchel replaced Southgate as England's new manager at the start of 2025.",
      "Although Toney managed just two minutes during a 3-1 friendly defeat against Senegal, the door still appears open for him to earn a place in the England squad for next summer's World Cup. However, he might have to return to the Premier League to achieve his spot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "\"Gary Neville is a w*****,\" chanted Nottingham Forest fans when they played Manchester United this month after his comments about flags.",
      "Sesko failed to fire at the City Ground and Neville said that he looked \"miles off it\" compared to Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who have hit the ground running since their arrivals.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked about the criticism at his press conference last week. He responded: \"Of course, nobody likes to hear, but he struggled a little bit, and that is a fact.",
      "\"So let's embrace that. It’s not personal, it’s not nothing. That is what I try to explain to the players. That is not personal. It's an opinion that is going to change in three weeks.",
      "\"Everything that is true today, in three weeks, could be a lie. So of course, it's hard to hear, but my advice to Ben is you are going to get used. And then it's going to be natural. We are going to help him and we are going to protect Ben because he works really hard and we want to succeed. So he's going to succeed.\"",
      "Amorim handled the question brilliantly, but Sesko would have benefited from a goal when he came on from the bench against Tottenham last weekend.",
      "Sesko was named on the bench, with Amorim reverting to the striker-less front three. He was introduced in the 58th minute and missed two good half-chances before being forced off with a knee injury.",
      "Amorim appeared to be concerned that the issue could be serious. Sesko will miss international duty with Slovenia, but the problem is not thought to be major and he will continue to be assessed.",
      "Sesko should have scored in the passage of play that led to his injury as he wanted too long on the ball and provided an opening for Micky van de Ven to recover with a brilliant tackle.",
      "Although Sesko might have got that half-second extra when he played in the Bundesliga, he won't get that in the Premier League. He should have pulled the trigger immediately or taken the ball inside, which would have positioned his body in front of the defender.",
      "It was a big moment in the game. Tottenham had just equalised and Sesko could have scored to restore United's advantage, but Van de Ven recovered and Spurs scored to make it 2-1.",
      "Alan Shearer, the leading goalscorer in Premier League history, is one of the best pundits in the business, and he's especially good value when analysing strikers on Match of the Day.",
      "Shearer delved into Sesko's appearance from the bench during his analysis segment, saying: \"Sesko struggled again. He's only scored twice in his 12 appearances and he came on today with just over half an hour to go.",
      "\"He had two really, really good chances and should have scored, to be honest. They worked it really well for him to get in the first time. He's either got to get his shot away early or he's got to push that ball forward quicker. He's not going to get that amount of time in the Premier League to work it back on his right foot.\"",
      "He continued: \"This one [the 86th-minute chance] is the bigger puzzle for me. I know he's struggling for confidence but any centre-forward knows you cannot allow the centre-half to come back at you.",
      "\"You've got to get across Van de Ven. By that time he should have a picture in his head of where the keeper is and what he wants to do. I don't think he has a clue what he wants to do because I don't even think he even knows Van de Ven is there and chasing him. I know he's struggling with confidence but it's a big 'must do better'.",
      "\"No one likes to see him coming off injured and we hope his knee is okay, but they are two chances you'd expect at that level that someone has to put away.\"",
      "The positive is that Sesko will learn from his appearance at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He is still only 22 and raw, so he was bound to need time to find his feet during his first season in England.",
      "In a dream world, Sesko would have been signed alongside a more experienced centre-forward, or Rasmus Hojlund would have been kept to share the burden of finding the back of the net.",
      "United were convinced Sesko was the right option in the summer transfer window. He had scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons and arrived with the potential to eventually become a 20-goal-per-season striker in the Premier League.",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "The forward built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month, finishing at the Stretford End with a clever flick, but he drew a blank in the next four matches.",
      "Sesko should have scored more than two. The standards at United should be high, but the club must play the cards in front of them, which means supporting Sesko in the coming weeks.",
      "Amorim is \"relaxed\" about Sekso's start at the club because he \"has more potential\" than he first thought. Sesko is understood to be a model professional and reports early for training sessions at Carrington.",
      "Sesko appears too talented not to become a success, but he is certain to receive more scrutiny from pundits until the end of the campaign. That is part of the game and they can be silenced by scoring goals.",

      "Even the most optimistic Manchester United fan would have struggled to make a decent case for extending Casemiro's contract beyond 2026 last season.",
      "The five-time Champions League winner reserved his best performances for the Europa League in 2024/25, with his Premier League showings not good enough for a team of United's stature.",
      "With no European football on offer this season it seemed the Brazilian would be on the fringes of first-team action, but three months into the campaign and he's one of the first names on the team sheet.",
      "Casemiro's contract expires next summer, though United could trigger the clause in his deal to add an additional 12 months onto his Old Trafford stay. With United expected to target a central midfielder next summer and Casemiro turning 34 in February, it might seem silly to do so. But he's still showing he can add value to the squad and could prove to be an invaluable mentor for any new recruit.",
      "So what should United do? Our writers have had their say:",
      "Casemiro has been hugely important this season. United are weaker when he is not on the pitch, which was highlighted again last weekend when he was replaced by Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Wilson Odobert breezed past Ugarte and Tottenham scored an equaliser. Casemiro's strong performances have sparked a conversation about his contract situation, but I believe he should be allowed to leave in the summer on a free transfer, regardless of how important he continues to be this season.",
      "United must take a long-term view and it's not logical to extend Casemiro's contract when he's in the winter of his career, so this season should be his swansong in Manchester.",
      "The fact that there is even a conversation among some fans about extending Casemiro's deal is a credit to him, but United should allow him to leave in the summer and sign a replacement.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 in February. How long he can keep up this level of performance is up for debate, and that's without mentioning he is the highest earner in the dressing room.",
      "The end of the season is an opportunity to move on from Casemiro and it should be taken. The Brazilian can leave the club with his head held high if he bows out by helping to secure Champions League qualification.",
      "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher seldom pull punches but even by their hard-hitting standards, a couple of remarks about Casemiro were genuine haymakers.",
      "“I think he (Erik ten Hag) oversaw two of the worst transfers Manchester United will ever have made in the signings of Casemiro and Antony,” Neville once said.",
      "Well, Casemiro has not only survived the verbal blows, he has produced a few performances that suggest reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated. Everyone knows this season’s most telling Casemiro statistic - five goals conceded when he has been on the pitch, 15 when he has been off it.",
      "He also has three goals, one assist and tops the tackle chart with 22. In short, he is proving a very valuable asset for Ruben Amorim.",
      "United should keep him for another season. If that means activating a clause which keeps him on the same extravagant wages, then fine.",
      "It’s a big club. Act big. Amorim will be desperate for a younger, more athletic, more dynamic defensive midfielder, but he will also need experienced alternatives and back-up. If that costs a few more quid than you would like, so be it.",
      "Football has not left Casemiro… and he should not be leaving Old Trafford.",
      "United will sign a central midfielder next summer and so there isn't much of a case to be made for keeping Casemiro for his influence on the pitch. However, having somebody with his experience around the club would be a massive help for whoever United decide to sign.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has done little this season to suggest he can help a new signing bed in, and so Casemiro should be kept at Old Trafford. That being said, it would have to be on reduced terms. United cannot afford to have such a high earner on the books purely for the experience he brings, and so a compromise on his salary would need to be reached.",
      "There's no escaping the fact United look a much better side when Casemiro is in the team. Full credit goes to the Brazilian for turning the public perception of him around.",
      "Should he stay beyond this season? Yes, but only on the right terms. United cannot afford for Casemiro to be one of the highest earners at the club.",
      "He has proven this season that he can play this system and be a good option for Amorim. Should he stay, United still can't avoid the midfield issue for another summer - they must sign a new first choice defensive midfielder and allow Casemiro to be the back-up.",

      "Manchester United visited Tottenham last weekend and I made my first visit to their stadium. I'd been repeatedly told it was the best arena in the country and it didn't fall short of that billing.",
      "Although the security staff took their time to admit the press into the media suite, it was worth the wait, as the press facilities and food offerings are second to none in the Premier League.",
      "The press food at Stamford Bridge is excellent, but Tottenham edges their London neighbours. The 12.30pm kick-off meant a full breakfast was on offer and the selection was superb for a media suite.",
      "The press room itself was akin to a luxury hotel reception. There was ample working space, comfortable leather-padded seats and Spurs offer lockers for journalists to store bags.",
      "The walk from the media suite to the press box is sign-posted - you could easily get lost on the way - and the interior of the ground is even more impressive than the exterior.",
      "Tottenham left White Hart Lane in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, and moved to their new 61,000-seater venue three years later. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new 100,000-seater Old Trafford by 2030 and there are a few lessons to be learned from Tottenham.",
      "The design of the stadium is outstanding. You feel like you're working in a special arena throughout your visit, and architecture firm Populous deserved all the plaudits they received.",
      "From a journalist's perspective, the press box is spacious and well-positioned, offering a good vantage point, while the media auditorium is a superb space for managers to conduct their post-match duties.",
      "Ratcliffe wants the new Old Trafford, set to be designed by Foster + Partners, to be the greatest arena in the world, and they will deliver if the rebuild is anything like Tottenham's home.",
      "Tottenham's stadium was rebuilt 170 yards away from where White Hart Lane stood, which means the feeling of the old ground hasn't been totally lost, and the new Old Trafford will seek to retain that 'feeling'.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is designed to maximise supporter experience and it brings fans closer to the pitch than at any comparable-sized stadium in the United Kingdom.",
      "The distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres to 7.9 metres, and the single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK with a capacity of 17,500 people.",
      "The steep South Stand is remarkable. It was designed with the hope that it would generate an intimidating atmosphere, but no such noise was produced during the game on Saturday.",
      "Like a lot of big clubs in the Premier League, Spurs have become a tourist attraction, which means there were hundreds of fans with tickets in that stand who did not contribute to the atmosphere.",
      "That is their prerogative and 'tourist fans' are still valued fans, but local Tottenham season ticket holders have argued their South Stand should be a designated area for supporters looking to create noise.",
      "The Stretford End is currently that stand within Old Trafford, and United should consider introducing a designated singing section to ensure an atmosphere can be created in the new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "I was fortunate enough to visit White Hart Lane before it was demolished. It was an ageing ground and Spurs were right to move on, but it could be intimidating for the opposition.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur stadium is not intimidating. It feels welcoming. United need to ensure they don't fall into the same trap.",

      "Alongside his corner being headed home by the Poland international to complete a hat-trick, Rashford created two big chances on the left. Lewandowski guided home his first cross into the box with Lamine Yamal benefiting from another of Rashford's passes.",
      "The latter did not count as a direct goal contribution with an attempted interception taking the ball into Yamal's path. Despite his influential role, Rashford missed some good chances to score and he also picked up a second yellow card of the season.",
      "That booking was not because of a bad foul though, with Rashford shown a caution for time-wasting when he slowly departed the pitch after being subbed off for Ferran Torres in the 88th minute.",
      "While it was likely done to run the clock down, Rashford's decision to slowly trudge off may have been done as he was taking in the applause with the travelling contingent all standing to clap his performance.",

Walking on the High Road side of the stadium, you pass one of the main receptions. Peak inside and the Europa League trophy is on full display with fans at 9am queuing for photos with it.",
      "It took the home supporters less than three minutes to chant ‘Champions of Europe, we know what we are’. That returned in added time before De Ligt silenced them.",
      "United defensive fluidity",
      "United were at their fluid best in the first half. When Spurs were in possession, United dropped into a back four with Luke Shaw pushing into a central midfield position.",
      "But he was not the only one to move positions. Harry Maguire found himself on the wing trying to cross into the box and at one stage Patrick Dorgu was almost in a centre-forward role as Bryan Mbeumo covered at wing-back.",

      "Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman has recalled Matthijs de Ligt to the national side for the upcoming international break. De Ligt deserved that recall, but was at fault for the equaliser. Then redeemed himself with a heroic header. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Stepped into the midfield at times which meant the shape sometimes looked like a back four. Shaw played ok, but was on the pitch for the late collapse. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",

      "Casemiro",
      "Started the game by playing a few loose passes and couldn't help United see out the victory. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was not at his best in the centre of the pitch. Looked sluggish and wasn't combative enough against Spurs' midfielders. Played the corner into the box for De Ligt's goal. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struggled in moments during the first half. He replaced Diogo Dalot in the starting team, but still looks raw and unconvincing. His final ball around the box must improve. 4",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Unplayable at times. Finished brilliantly to open the scoring and now has four goals in his last four games. 8",
      "Amad",

      "Ruben Amorim confirmed Manchester United could consider strengthening their attacking options in January, depending on the severity of the injury Benjamin Sesko suffered against Tottenham.",
      "Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour and was forced off the pitch after receiving treatment for a knee injury.",
      "United had to finish the game with 10 men because Amorim had used all of his substitutions.",
      "Amorim was asked about the striker's injury at his post-match press conference following the 2-2 draw. \"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether it was serious, Amorim said: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "Sesko failed to pull the trigger twice when he was presented with two half chances against Spurs, but Amorim believes a lack of confidence wasn't to blame. He said: \"No, I think... I think that is not the biggest concern now.",
      "\"That happened in the same way that he is not scoring and then he scores two goals in the next two games [Brentford and Sunderland], so that happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations in December, which prompted Amorim to confirm the club could be active in the January window.",
      "Amorim said the severity of Sesko's knee injury could influence plans. \"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has reminded Manchester United what they're missing out on – again. The Barcelona loanee chipped in with a couple of assists as the Spanish champions enjoyed a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo at the Balaidos Stadium on Sunday night.",
      "Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock inside the opening quarter of an hour, beating Ionut Radu from 12 yards. Sergio Carreira equalised a few moments later, slicing through the heart of Hansi Flick's infamous offside trap.",
      "The veteran striker restored Barcelona's lead later in the first half, latching onto a delightfully weighted cross from Rashford. Celta Vigo pulled one back, again, with Borja Iglesias smashing the ball past Wojciech Szczesny.",
      "Lamine Yamal gave the Catalan outfit some breathing space at the break, finding the net deep into stoppage time. The United star had turned provider again, picking out the Barcelona wonderkid at the back post.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "Lewandowski put the fourth and final nail in the coffin in the second half to complete his hat-trick. With Rayo Vallecano holding Real Madrid to a goalless draw, Flick's side narrowed their rivals' advantage in the title race to just three points.",
      "After the game, Rashford marked the occasion with a celebratory post on Instagram, which chalked up almost half a million likes by Tuesday morning. The England international wrote: \"Important three points away. We keep working TEAM.\"",
      "Among the thousands of fans who liked the post were David De Gea and Bruno Fernandes. Flick was pleased to see an improvement in his side's general play over the weekend. As quoted by ESPN, the Barcelona boss told reporters: \"Yes [I am satisfied].",
      "\"I appreciate a lot what I saw today. At the moment, it's like, especially in the first half, we made some mistakes, more than in the second half, and they use it. Two mistakes for the goals.",
      "\"But what I saw, also in first half, we controlled the game. It was a really good match with the ball, and especially in the second half, we defend much better.",
      "\"I think the second half gives us confidence also for the next matches. This is what we need. When you can make pressure on the opponent it's a good way. We did it. I like what I saw, especially in the second half.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Rashford vowed to improve his overall performance – and he delivered. Speaking to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo earlier this month, the 28-year-old said: \"I try to give my best.",
      "\"I could have done better against Elche, and I promise to improve because I'm not entirely happy with my performance overall. We work hard to win. We're taking it one game at a time.",

      "Marcus Rashford delivered two assists for Barcelona as they secured a comfortable win at Celta Vigo on Sunday. His creative contributions for a rejuvenated Robert Lewandowski continued an impressive spell of form for the Manchester United loanee.",
      "Hansi Flick's team began the weekend trailing La Liga leaders Real Madrid by five points. Yet Barca narrowed the deficit to just three points after Los Blancos were held to a goalless draw against derby opponents Rayo Vallecano earlier on Sunday.",
      "The performance wasn't without its flaws, though, as highlighted by sections of the Spanish press. Nevertheless, the overall response to Rashford's vital pair of assists was favourable as Lewandowski, who secured the three points thanks to his hat-trick, profited significantly from the Englishman's contribution.",
      "Mundo Deportivo was especially emphatic in its praise of the United loanee and labelled him as \"one of the key players in Vigo.\" Beyond his direct goal involvements, his set-piece delivery proved dangerous on the west coast.",
      "\"The English striker improved his pressing performance and delivered three corners that resulted in goals,\" read one passage from the newspaper's coverage. \"Rashford worked hard to press in defence better than in recent matches, outpaced [Oscar] Mingueza and ended up being decisive with three crosses that ended in goals, two to Lewandowski, one of them from a corner, and one that Ilaix [Moriba] deflected and Lamine Yamal finished.\"",
      "The same analysis praised Rashford's \"excellent passing ability\" and explained how crucial his pressing was in disrupting Celta's flow. Meanwhile, El Pais emphasised that Rashford was \"the Barcelona player who is taking on defenders most often when he receives the ball at his feet.\"",
      "The publication also described the Englishman's \"superb\" delivery to Lewandowski for the decisive goal at 2-1. Sergio Carreira's early equaliser kept the contest level for much of the opening period, with Borja Iglesias again restoring parity before half-time.",
      "However, it wasn't entirely positive, as Sport highlighted the attacker's \"unforgivable mistake\" when he squandered a clear one-on-one opportunity against Celta goalkeeper Ionut Radu. That error proved particularly costly at the time as Carreira netted his equaliser immediately from the subsequent Celta breakaway.",
      "\"He [Rashford] had time, space, and every option, but his finish was weak, almost a pass to the goalkeeper,\" read one excerpt. \"The clearest chance of the match evaporated without consequence...or at least, without the desired one.\"",
      "Yet another section of the same publication celebrated Rashford for the contributions that did prove effective. His \"exceptional attacking performance\" was considered especially impressive given Lamine Yamal endured a difficult opening half in Vigo.",
      "Sport's evaluation put the Englishman on a pedestal: \"Rashford was a constant threat from the start of the match. He wasn't clinical with his first scoring opportunity, and in fact, Celta's first equaliser came after the England international squandered a one-on-one with Radu that could have put Barcca 2-0 up.",
      "\"However, this setback didn't faze Marcus, who ended up having a magnificent game and being the originator of three of the team's four goals at Balaidos. His crosses for Lewandowski's second and third goals were impeccable, and the Polish striker made the most of them.\"",
      "Rashford, whose long-term future in Catalonia is still far from certain, enters the international break having registered at least one goal or assist in seven of his previous eight league appearances. England manager Thomas Tuchel will be hoping to see this form continue when the Three Lions face Serbia and Albania in their forthcoming fixtures.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay has urged Napoli to sign Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with the Scotland international speaking to Antonio Conte about his former teammate.",
      "Mainoo has fallen drastically down the pecking order at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim. After being a regular last term, the 20-year-old has played just eight games so far this term.",
      "Amorim has preferred Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Premier League games, with Mainoo coming off the bench in seven of the first 10 games. However, he was an unused sub in the 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest and was left out of the squad entirely against Tottenham, due to a knock.",
      "With United already out of the Carabao Cup and not playing European football, Mainoo's minutes are expected to be limited until the January transfer window, which could place his World Cup hopes in doubt.",
      "A temporary move has been tipped ahead of the reopening of the window, with Napoli strongly linked. Previously, it had been reported that the Italian champions would be willing to pay his full salary to bring him to Naples.",
      "Now, The Sun have reported that McTominay is doing all he can to reunite with Mainoo in Serie A. The 28-year-old left United in 2024 and scored 12 goals in his first season, winning the Scudetto.",
      "Sources have told the outlet that McTominay has informed Conte that he should sanction a move to sign Mainoo. \"Scott has been to see Conte and told him to get Kobbie,\" the source said.",
      "\"He's told him all about his strengths and what an outstanding player he is. He knows all about him from his time at United and thinks he would be a great addition to the squad, whether it's on loan or a permanent deal.",
      "\"Kobbie has been brought up the right way at United having been in the academy since he was a little boy. He would fit straight in and give Napoli a boost.\"",
      "In a recent interview, Amorim admitted there simply isn't room for Mainoo in his squad. \"Every minute we are using to prepare the future with a lot of games and less training,\" Amorim told beIN Sports.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly one of 11 clubs in the mix for German under-17 ‘prodigy’ Kennet Eichhorn, who can leave his country via a release clause.",
      "United are well versed in bringing young talents through into their first team. In times gone by, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt all made their way to the first team through the academy.",
      "Of late, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are some of the big names to have followed.",
      "The latter was prised away from Atletico Madrid, while more recent academy players to join from other big clubs include Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi.",
      "Now, United are being linked with a man being called a ‘prodigy’ by Sky Germany – Hertha Berlin midfielder Eichhorn.",
      "‘All of Europe’s top clubs’ are said to be interested in Eichhorn. There are 11 named in the report, in the Bundesliga, there is: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Elsewhere in Europe, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and United are said to be keen.",
      "The market for Eichhorn is said to be ‘unprecedented’ with his release clause activated in the summer.",
      "Eichhorn is the youngest player in Bundesliga 2 history and has played nine games this term, showing there is faith in him to perform in senior football.",
      "That said, he’s not awfully high on any stats compared to older players in the league. His best asset has perhaps been recovering the ball, which Eichhorn has done 3.6 times per game so far this term.",
      "He does commit a lot of fouls though – 15 already this season, which has led to five yellow cards and a suspension.",
      "It is unlikely that he’d be thrown immediately into senior football if he made a move to a big club, and his performances against players his own age have seen him standout, so he’d surely be a great asset in academy football.",
      "Playing as a defensive midfielder, in four games for Germany under-17s so far, Eichhorn has scored twice, with both goals coming in a 4-0 victory over Luxembourg.",
      "It feels likely that if Eichhorn continues to perform for the under-17s side – which he has captained in every game he’s played – the midfielder will be given opportunities in the older teams.",
      "Where he ends up in club football currently remains to be seen, but the German is in a good position with some big sides after him."

      "Manchester United are one of the clubs reportedly tracking an Ivorian wing-back, with offers ‘expected’ in January, but Amad Diallo should not worry about his compatriot.",
      "United’s defence has been the main downfall this season. They are in a good spot – seventh in the Premier League and just two points off third-placed Chelsea.",
      "However, only the bottom five have conceded more than their tally of 18. Were they to shore things up at the back, they could be in an even better spot.",
      "According to Sabah, United are one of the clubs who are interested in signing Galatasaray wing-back Wilfried Singo.",
      "The report states that the Red Devils, Liverpool and Arsenal have all decided to monitor Singo following his Champions League performance against Ajax.",
      "Singo received a SofaScore rating of 7.0 in the 3-0 victory, in which he played 90 minutes at right-back.",
      "He made on key pass, created one big chance, made 92 per cent of his passes accurately, had 73 touches of the ball with only one unsuccessful, won two of his three tackles, made three interceptions, one clearance and six recoveries.",
      "It’s believed that offers are will be received for the Ivorian in January. He has a €60million (£52.9m) release clause.",
      "It’s not suggested which of the interested sides are likely to offer, but should Singo be signed by United, he’d not be an upgrade on international team-mate Amad at right wing-back.",
      "While a lot of his stats are not available on FBRef to compare him to Amad, the ones that are show the United man in a good light.",
      "On the front foot, Amad has taken 15 shots to Singo’s solitary one, has scored once and assisted twice, with Singo yet to score, while he has one assist to his name this term.",
      "Amad has also played far more minutes than Singo so far this term, suggesting he’s a more valued asset at his current side than his compatriot is as his.",
      "Singo has committed more foul – four to six – has been fouled far less, with Amad’s tally 14 to Singo’s one, while the United man has crossed nine times this season, with Singo doing so just twice, and Amad willing double the amount of tackles.",
      "Singo wins on interceptions made – five compared to four – but of the available metrics, that’s all he wins in league football.",
      "Should United sign him, they’d be making a mistake replacing Amad. And while Singo can also play as a centre-back, he’s not exactly covering himself in glory with his stats in defence at the moment.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been told that he has a “problem to sort” regarding one of his players, who has been made to “look bad”.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Four key Manchester United stars have ‘missed full training’ ahead of Sunday’s match versus Liverpool, but this is not as worrying as it seems…",
      "The former ‘future of Man Utd’ is so (illogically) hated that anyone associating with him gets abused. Could Amad Diallo be next on the Red Devils sh*tlist?",
      "A transfer insider has suggested that the impending signing of Bryan Mbeumo at Manchester United means there’s a “limited” chance their top scorer keeps his role, but he feels he’ll ..."

      "Ten Hag was sacked a few months later and replaced by Ruben Amorim, with Man Utd ending up with egg on their faces as McTominay helped Antonio Conte’s side win the Scudetto in his first season at the club.",
      "McTominay contributed 12 goals and four assists in 34 appearances in Serie A last term as he took the league by storm – but he has not quite reached the same levels as last season this campaign.",
      "The Scotland international has two goals and one assist in ten appearances in the league as Napoli’s recent form has seen them drop down to fourth in Serie A.",
      "And now journalist Mark Brus has told Caught Offside that he has heard Man Utd’s ‘name mentioned in a potential emotional bid to bring him back’ to Old Trafford.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim authority rising on one-year anniversary at Man Utd",
      "A source told Brus: “There is concrete interest in Scott McTominay. Manchester United would have him back, and keep an eye on Newcastle and Tottenham. Barcelona also view him as someone who could be a good fit for their midfield.”",
      "Despite that interest, the Scotland international is ‘very happy with life in Italy’ and Napoli ‘don’t want to put him on the market at all’.",
      "Naples journalist Vincenzo Credendino explained earlier this year why McTominay has flourished under Conte, he told the BBC: “Conte changed his system to put him in the best conditions to play.",
      "“In the system of Conte he’s not a builder, he’s a raider – the best option while you have a number nine like Romelu Lukaku, who today plays – and builds – a lot for the team.”",
      "Credendino added: “You can compare McTominay with the big midfielders of Conte’s history. In his first years at Juventus (2011-12 and 2012-13), Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal scored nine and 10 goals respectively.",
      "“It’s not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte as Conte is perfect for McTominay.”",
      "Speaking in December on why he chose to join Napoli, McTominay told BBC Scotland: “I saw the passionate fans, I saw the coach, I saw the players and I saw an opportunity.",
      "“I took it, I didn’t look back. It didn’t take me long to make the decision because I knew that was what I wanted and I’ll never have any regrets in my life. As soon as I put my mind to something I want to do it, that’s it. There’s no holding me back.",
      "“I love this place, I love the fans, I love my team-mates.”",
      "McTominay is officially the 18th best player in world football. Maybe Rio Ferdinand should reflect on him being better than Declan Rice and only slightly worse than Harry Kane.",
      "Peter Schmeichel has questioned Manchester United letting a pair of stars leave the club, and he “hopes” one of them scores “25 goals” to show them what they’re missing.",
      "Napoli head coach Antonio Conte struggled to believe that Man Utd sold Scottish midfielder Scott McTominay to the Serie A side.",
      "Ex-Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay has called Rasmus Hojlund in order to persuade his former team-mate to join him at Napoli, according to reports."

      "Real Madrid youngster Endrick has reportedly responded to shock interest from Man Utd after Benjamin Sesko suffered an injury.",
      "Man Utd spent almost £200m on new attackers over the summer with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Sesko all arriving at Old Trafford for big fees.",
      "The Red Devils’ goal output has improved this season but Sesko’s performances have been disappointing with just two Premier League goals to his name in 11 appearances.",
      "Sesko picked up a knee injury in their 2-2 draw against Tottenham at the weekend with fans worried that it could be a serious ACL injury.",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano yesterday insisted that it isn’t his ACL and that Sesko’s injury won’t be a “super long one” like “six, seven, eight months”.",
      "Romano wrote: “We are still waiting for an official statement from Manchester United, but my understanding is that the injury from Benjamin Sesko is not a super serious injury. So, it’s not an injury that is going to take, I don’t know, six, seven, eight months to see Benjamin Sesko available on the pitch again.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim authority rising on one-year anniversary at Man Utd",
      "“Well, let’s wait for the final test made by Manchester United, the medical staff. So, we wait for an official statement, but the initial feeling after the injury from Manchester United staff at the moment is quite positive.",
      "“So, it’s not going to be a super serious or long one. It’s going to take some time, but it’s not going to be a super long one.",
      "“And so, that’s a positive news for Manchester United, of course, and also could have an impact on the January transfer window because Ruben Amorim after the game said, ‘Let’s see about the injury of Benjamin Sesko. Maybe if it’s a serious one in January, we might have to do something in that position,’ but at the moment, again, doesn’t look like an ACL injury, so a super long one.”",
      "There had been rumours that Man Utd could sign a new striker in the January transfer window anyway with Joshua Zirkzee rumoured to be on his way out.",
      "Brazilian striker Endrick has been one of the names mooted but now Brazilian outlet Globo Esporte has claimed that ‘it’s only a matter of time before Endrick joins Lyon for the final stretch of the 2025/26 season.’",
      "It is understood that ‘the French club is already exchanging drafts with Real Madrid to expedite bureaucratic aspects of the contract to be signed at the end of the year’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Negotiations began in the second half of November, and from the very first moment, the 19-year-old welcomed the transfer to France . Not even the recent interest from Manchester United, following the injury of Slovenian Benjamin Šeško, changed Endrick’s mind; he seeks a leading role and playing time to fulfill his dream of representing the national team at the World Cup.’",
      "Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti revealed that he advised Endrick to speak to Real Madrid in order to work out what his best move was for the second half of the season.",
      "Ancelotti said recently: “Yes, I spoke with him (Endrick) at the beginning of this season. He was injured, but now he’s fine, back, and he has to think with his entourage about what’s best.",
      "“Talk to the club, to see what’s best for him. Endrick is very young, this won’t be his last World Cup. He could play in the 2026 World Cup, because he has the quality for it, but he could also be in the 2030 World Cup, or the 2034 World Cup, and maybe even the 2038 World Cup.”",

      "Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer claims that Benjamin Sesko “struggled” once again as Man Utd drew 2-2 against Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Amorim could easily have defended Sesko to the hilt after Neville’s ‘awkward’ criticism of the striker. What he actually did stands the Man Utd striker in good stead.",
      "Dimitar Berbatov has issued a warning to Gary Neville as he has urged the Manchester United legend to go easier on summer signing Benjamin Sesko.",

Even Nottingham Forest have picked up a win now, which was over Leeds and brings an ever harsher spotlight on Daniel Farke.",
      "And suddenly Eddie Howe is looking a bit nervous too, while Marco Silva also looks to be in serious trouble.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",

      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",

      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",

      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but it’s looking more and more positive at home and in Europe, and going into the international break on the back of a 4-0 win over a very good Bournemouth side is a lovely place to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",

And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",

The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been two wins from two since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously third in the league.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 11th in the table after 11 games feels a little bit silly.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",

He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 20Premier League games, and just one from six very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raised the stakes. A thumping Champions League win over Copenhagen and a very stupid draw against Manchester United is probably just about enough to keep him out of the international break firing line.",

      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",

      "You might argue that Wirtz is a £100m-plus player so should be doing better than Leeds United’s Sean Longstaff, but that would be nit-picking.",
      "“Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates,” said Nagelsmann.",

      "Some at Manchester United are reportedly ‘internally’ still questioning the decision to sell Alejandro Garnacho, who it’s felt needed ‘guidance and man-management’ and got neither from Ruben Amorim.",
      "United got some saleable assets out of the door in the summer. Garnacho and Antony were the two sales made, while Rasmus Hojlund and Marcus Rashford will likely bring in permanent fees if United decide to sell at the end of their respective loans in Europe.",
      "The sale of Garnacho is one that Amorim essentially forced, having apparently told the winger he would have to find himself another club to play for.",
      "The United boss apparently said to him: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "That informed other clubs that he was definitely on the chopping block, and allowed Chelsea to sign him for less than United wanted.",
      "While the Blues long showed an interest in Garnacho, meaning the Red Devils knew there was somewhere for him to be offloaded, there are apparently some at his former club who feel he shouldn’t have been sold.",
      "The Amorim fallout was due to public comments made by Garnacho, but according to The Telegraph, there are some at the club who ‘internally’ still question the decision to offload him.",
      "Indeed, they feel he was ‘simply young and petulant’ and was ‘in need of guidance and careful man-management,’ which Amorim clearly did not give him, as opposed to ‘being cast as a bad egg and a corrosive presence.’",
      "However, United seemingly see offloading Garnacho as a good choice, as Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox were ‘determined to ensure’ that Amorim’s authority was not questioned in any way.",
      "They similarly got shot of Rashford, who Amorim clearly was not a fan of early on, with the forward only playing six games for the United boss early on in his tenure.",
      "While he scored three goals in those games, Rashford’s training efforts were not appreciated by Amorim, who loaned him out first to Aston Villa in January and then Barcelona this season.",
      "While some believe Rashford would improve the current United team, given he has six goals and nine assists as a Barcelona player already, it is unlikely Amorim cares what his side would look like with the former academy man in it.",

      "The Red Devils rescued a point in the dying moments of a 2-2 draw against Tottenham over the weekend with Matthijs de Ligt’s header maintaining their five-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim hinted after the match that Man Utd could have to look at strengthening their forward line in the winter window as he pointed to Sesko’s injury and Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for AFCON.",
      "Amorim told reporters: “We have to check everything, we have to check what’s happened with Ben.",
      "“Of course we are going to have a problem there (AFCON), but we already knew, you can prepare in summer, but then you have a lot of players who are not going to play because it’s one game a week, so the manage of that situation is going to be hard, so let’s see when the window is open if we can improve the team and trying to repair something that happened. Until then we have to take the chance. We’ll see.”",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim authority rising on one-year anniversary at Man Utd",
      "But Romano reckons it could be unlikely that Man Utd sign a new striker if Sesko is only out for a short period of time.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “While I’m recording this video, it’s 2:30pm in England, but still no official statement from Manchester United on the injury of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“My information, guys, is that internally at Man United, they feel that is not going to be a super long injury, so not six, seven, eight months, not that kind of injury. That’s the feeling of Manchester United. It’s going to take some time, of course, he’s not going to be not going to be ready tomorrow morning, but not going to be a super long injury.",
      "“And that’s obviously an important news, an important impact. Also Manchester United strategies, because Ruben Amorim after the game, they had a draw against Tottenham and Ruben Amorim said: ‘Let’s see also the injury of Sesko We have some players going for AFCON. And then there is the injury of Sesko that might impact the general transfer window for Man United.",
      "“Well,  in case of long injury, maybe season over, in that case, Man United had to consider something for the general transfer window. Now, the expectation, according to my information internally, Man United feel that the injury is not super serious, it’s not going to be super long. It’s going to take some time again, it’s not a short one, but not gonna take super long, and that’s important.",
      "“So let’s wait for Manchester United statement, but that’s the feeling.",
      "“Just one for a few questions linked to this situation. First questions in England, some reports of maybe Rasmus Hojland can come back to Man United, from Napoli loan to cover the Sesko injury…no Rasmus Hojland doesn’t have any recall clause to his contract at Napoli with Manchester United for the loan.",
      "“So there is no recall clause. And also, Hojland feels as a Napoli player, not as a Man United player on loan. Hojland, 100% feels as a Napoli player. Napoli have all the intentions to sign Hojland on a permanent transfer from Man United, so with an obligation to buy there is an obligation to buy clause.",
      "“Man United expect to receive a 50 million euros for Hojland, and they’re not planning to have the player back at the club. So at the moment, the situation is completely quiet about that, nothing expected in terms of movements for Rasmus Hojland, apart from what happens with Benjamin Sesko.”",
      "And website United in Focus have revealed that Man Utd have sent scouts out to Qatar to watch the Under-17 World Cup and ‘among them was the Brazilian Erling Haaland, 17-year-old Dell from Bahia’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Alongside a handful of Brazilians, United were keeping an eye on Dell and with three goals in the competition already, that interest will be growing, but he won’t come cheap.’",
      "Real Madrid youngster Endrick has reportedly responded to shock interest from Man Utd after Benjamin Sesko suffered an injury.",

      "Romano said: “Of course performances haven’t been always excellent, but coach and club maintain their trust in Ugarte. They hope for improvement soon.”",
      "But The Athletic has revealed on Tuesday that Ugarte was criticised in front of his team-mates by Amorim last season, as the Man Utd head coach told new Chelsea winger Alejandro Garnacho that he ‘would need a good agent during the summer window’.",
      "Laurie Whitwell wrote: ‘Manuel Ugarte played for Amorim at Sporting between 2021 and 2023, but he was not given special treatment during the end-of-season meeting at Carrington that followed United’s Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur. This was the gathering, the day before United faced Aston Villa in the final Premier League game, where Amorim told Alejandro Garnacho he would need a good agent during the summer window due to him remaining as head coach. That conflict was what attracted the headlines when details emerged.",
      "‘Several players were on the receiving end, too, but Amorim had particularly pointed feedback for Ugarte, who he felt had let his work rate slide from their time together at Sporting. Amorim believed Ugarte had gotten comfortable and said he did not recognise him as the same player from their first stint together.’",
      "Gary Neville has since insisted that Ugarte is not good enough to be a Man Utd player and suspected back in September that Amorim “doesn’t quite fancy him”.",
      "Neville added: “I can’t help thinking that he [Ruben Amorim] doesn’t quite fancy him.",
      "“He’s never really put him it from the beginning. He’s gone with Casemiro and Fernandes but Amorim needs to sort the midfield out.",
      "“You can’t have that midfield. They’ve tried Mount, Fernandes, Ugarte, Casemiro but he’s changing a lot every game.”",
      "When asked if they were ‘Man United players’, Neville replied: “Ugarte, for me, absolutely not. Mason Mount, to be fair, has done well the first two games but I’m not sure where he fits in.",

      "Man Utd have not properly challenge for the Premier League title since Sir Alex Ferguson left Old Trafford and retired in 2013.",

      "Today would have been the day Ruben Amorim was dreading; his one-year anniversary is said to be the day it becomes considerably cheaper to sack him.",
      "But Manchester United’s recent performances mean the manager might never have sat quite so comfortably in the Old Trafford hotseat.",
      "Of the five international breaks he has spent as United boss, this must be the one he has felt most at ease with himself and the events unfolding around him. Amorim will certainly sleep better this fortnight than he did during the October break.",
      "Even some warm-ish words from his boss won’t have soothed the concerns Amorim had for his prospects of making a relative success of his United reign. He went into the four-game run between interlulls knowing he had three weeks, not three years, to prove himself.",
      "Now, on the back of two wins and two draws extending an unbeaten run to five, Amorim ought to feel like he has earned himself some breathing space.",
      "‘Teams who have beaten Liverpool’ is almost the least exclusive club in football right now, but that did not make United’s first win at Anfield in almost a decade any less sweet. Even more satisfyingly for the manager, it was a consequence of getting his tactics ‘spot on’.",
      "The joy of beating their biggest rivals would have been forgotten six days later had Brighton rocked up at Old Trafford – the Amex North in recent years – and won for the fourth season in succession. But United, if a little chaotically, put the Seagulls to the sword to climb briefly into the top four. It wasn’t immediately obvious which was the bigger novelty.",
      "Then came successive 2-2 draws in games that showed some familiar failings but illustrated again the kind of resilience too often missing from United sides in recent seasons.",
      "That determination, the hint of some cojones in Amorim’s ranks, is perhaps the most encouraging facet of those four performances. In each game, United have suffered set-backs but offered a spirited and tangible reaction each time.",
      "At Liverpool, when Cody Gakpo levelled, more Merseyside misery felt inevitable, especially given Arne Slot’s oddly gung-ho approach. Instead, United dug in and, via the magnificence of Harry Maguire’s bulbous bonce, seized all three points when most doubted they would take one.",
      "The Brighton game was going much more serenely with United 3-0 up. Not quite uncharted territory for Amorim, but certainly unfamiliar, so perhaps we ought to give him a pass for the changes made in the name of load management that almost saw the Seagulls dump a big one on Old Trafford again. United weathered a storm at 3-2 and produced a moment of decisive attacking quality to make the game safe once more.",
      "Narrower leads at Forest and Spurs were squandered and, worse, overturned. But, again, United showed the character to earn creditable points when previously, most likely, they would have meekly accepted their fate.",
      "The TL;DR from those four games: United remain a flawed outfit – obviously – but they are developing a knack of covering up those flaws rather better. And there are signs of more sustainable improvement.",
      "Certainly individually. Just with the most basic level of competency, Senne Lammens has brought some serenity to United’s rearguard, almost certainly aided by more assured performances from Luke Shaw and, most noticeably, Matthijs De Ligt.",
      "Or perhaps the presence of a trustworthy goalkeeper is soothing defenders’ nerves shredded by two seasons in front of Andre Onana and the Turkish fella deemed less competent even than the Cameroonian. Regardless, for Stretford Enders, watching United defend now feels a less sphincter-shrinking experience than it did even before the last break.",
      "It must help too that the football was only ever taking a break from Casemiro – it never left him after all. The Brazilian, on a similar redemption arc to Maguire, has gone from an expensive liability to the midfielder Amorim can’t be without.",
      "Not just because the 33-year-old has rediscovered his mojo but primarily because the drop-off between him and Manuel Ugarte is so alarmingly stark. The urge to give Casemiro a breather against Brighton was understandable, but Amorim will know now it is not a luxury he can yet afford until United furnish him with another ready-to-go No.6.",
      "They recognised the need in the summer but failed to move decisively. United are never shy in telling us how prohibitive the January market can be, but it is not a mistake Amorim or United can afford to make two summers in succession. That Amorim can even contemplate thinking so far ahead is testament to the Red Devils’ recent form.",
      "As it turns out, United made more savvy moves than mis-steps in the market this year. Just being rid of the bomb squad banished by Amorim’s firm approach has improved the mood and manner at Carrington, further enhanced by the presence and influence of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, two stars apparently born for a stage like Old Trafford, neither afraid of the responsibility that comes with the privilege.",
      "Like any team, United is the sum of its parts, and Amorim is positively effecting his individuals. Just as importantly, especially at Old Trafford where the whims of the dressing room have buried previous managers, the level of fight plainly evident suggests those players are buying into the boss too.",
      "Full steam ahead, Champions League, then? Steady on. Amorim’s dogmatic faith in one particular system still feels naïve but his blunt honesty, combined with concrete improvements, makes him easier to root for.",
      "A year to the day since he first walked into a building site at Carrington and a dressing room worthy of being condemned, Amorim has earned him the chance to build on the foundations of his rebuild.",
      "Spurs aren’t stupid; they are just a club filled with people who like doing stupid things. And it’s usually that man Richarlison.",
      "We’re deep into the international break wilderness now, and there’s an awful lot of absolute guff desperately trying to fill the news vacuum.",
      "Liverpool expectations have been adjusted to qualifying for the Champions League but Cody Gakpo surely has to be part of the plan.",
      "No Premier League team tackles less in the middle third and only two teams run less than this failing Liverpool side.",
      "Daniel Farke is the manager under the harshest international-break spotlight which leads us to inevitably ponder who might be next in the Leeds hotseat.",
      "Marco Silva has suddenly become the Sack Race favourite as Fulham consider a stupid decision, but Eddie Howe and Arne Slot are far from safe…"

      "The sister of a star Premier League midfielder has revealed why he turned down the chance to join Manchester United and instead headed to a league rival.",
      "United’s midfield is perhaps the area causing the most worry at the moment. The attack has been addressed, with summer signings Bryan Mbeumo – Premier League player of the month for October – Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all developing well.",
      "There is a wealth of defensive options, with the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro and Harry Maguire in the centre, and Patrick Dorgu, Diogo Dalot and Amad Diallo out in the wide roles.",
      "But in the midfield, Manuel Ugarte has struggled, Casemiro has been inconsistent, Bruno Fernandes is playing out of position and Kobbie Mainoo can’t get a game.",
      "United attempted to sort their midfield in 2024, with Amadou Onana courted after a solid spell with Everton.",
      "His sister has now revealed why Onana turned down United in favour of heading to Aston Villa, where he’s since played 43 times and scored six goals.",
      "Onana’s sister and agent, Melissa, said: “Aston Villa’s sporting project was crystal clear. It was a project where Amadou could continue to develop. We spoke with the sporting director, and the salary was also attractive, let’s not kid ourselves.",
      "“The Euros were coming up, Amadou was performing well, and we finalised the deal. Then, Manchester United entered the picture. But I had already given my word to Aston Villa.",
      "“We knew very well that Manchester would be able to offer better financial terms, but we had already given our word to Aston Villa, and the project was a good fit. The style of football played, the club’s ambition: Amadou felt right at home there.”",
      "Had United’s approach come earlier, Onana could perhaps have been lacing up his boots at Old Trafford now rather than Villa Park.",
      "Given the current drawbacks of the United midfield, there’s a good chance Onana would be starting there.",
      "That said, when fit, he has been an important member of Villa’s side. This season, either side of a hamstring injury, Onana has played seven times in the Premier League, starting six games and scoring once.",
      "That goal came in a 4-0 thrashing of Bournemouth last time out – who started the day above Villa – and pushed the Midlands outfit up to sixth in the table, within two points of third.",
      "As such, there is a sense that Villa could push on and continue to impress, as they have done for the last couple of seasons -finishing in the top six in both."

      "Napoli’s determination to sign Kobbie Mainoo on loan has reached fever pitch, with sources confirming the 20-year-old Manchester United midfielder is open to the move and the Red Devils are ready to green-light an exit, on one condition.",
      "The Serie A frontrunners, managed by Antonio Conte, see Mainoo as the final piece in their Scudetto and Champions League puzzle, and are willing to meet Man Utd‘s financial demands to make it happen.",
      "Sources close to Mainoo reveal the England international is increasingly receptive to a January switch to Naples.",
      "While he would ideally stay in the Premier League, the recent success of British talents in Italy – Scott McTominay’s seamless integration at Napoli and Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s resurgence at AC Milan – has piqued his interest.",
      "“Kobbie sees the pathway,” one insider said. “Regular football in a title race and Europe is exactly what he needs for the World Cup.”",
      "Napoli’s proposal remains unchanged: a straight loan with an option to buy, covering Mainoo’s full weekly wages. President Aurelio De Laurentiis has green-lit the deal, viewing the teenager as a long-term successor to Stanislav Lobotka.",
      "Conte has personally assured Mainoo of a starring role alongside McTominay and Billy Gilmour in a dynamic, high-pressing midfield. Napoli would also be keen on a loan with an option to buy, but sources say a permanent move in January is not something on United’s radar.",
      "DON’T MISS ➡️ The 10 Erik ten Hag signings still at Man Utd and when they could leave",
      "At Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim’s stance is clear: Mainoo leaves only if a replacement arrives first.",
      "The Portuguese coach refuses to weaken his squad mid-season. Indeed, United have plans to add to their midfield and interest in a number of profiles, including Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, with a senior source stating: “Ruben won’t sanction Kobbie’s exit unless the depth is maintained. A new body in, then the door opens.”",
      "With Tottenham, Newcastle, and Manchester City still monitoring Mainoo, Napoli hold the edge.",
      "As TEAMtalk previously reported, Mainoo’s camp is now in “positive dialogue” with the Partenopei.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has picked out the three players key to Manchester United’s recent improvement under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese boss was being tipped for the Old Trafford sack for the first couple of months of the campaign, which featured Premier League defeats to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford, as well as the harrowing League Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "But a run of five Premier League games unbeaten to lift United to seventh in the Premier League has granted Amorim breathing space and hope for the future of the club, with a number of players – old and new – producing fine individual performances.",
      "When asked who United’s ‘most important player right now’ is, Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “I don’t think it’s one man. It can’t be down to one man. [Matthijs] De Ligt has been our best defender this season, he is even adding goals for us, like the last-minute goal the other day.",
      "“But in terms of his his press, he’s assertive and has willingness to go into foreign areas of the pitch to defend at right times. His clearing out of his box is brilliant.",
      "“[Bryan] Mbeumo has been a joke as well. He’s really stepped in and been a mainstay and is someone who can give us two or three seconds on the ball, score important goals for us, create chances.",
      "“I saw Thomas Frank’s comments about him yesterday, being a complete winger. I think, by the end of the season, he will be one of the most complete wingers in the league. He can do everything, he just needs to keep consistently doing that in a red shirt.”",
      "Amorim will be without Mbeumo over the Christmas period and into the new year when the Cameroonian heads to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "And the United boss admitted that his absence may lead the Red Devils hierarchy to push for reinforcements in January.",
      "“Of course, we are going to have a problem there, but we already knew that,” he said. “So the management of that situation is going to be hard.”",
      "“But let’s see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to repair something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.”",
      "Ferdinand also named Senne Lammens, who joined from Royal Antwerp for £22m in the summer, as another key player in their upturn.",
      "The 23-year-old spent the first three games on the bench but has now asserted himself as United’s No.1 ahead of Altay Bayindir after Andre Onana joined Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "“And the goalkeeper,” Ferdinand continued. “You can’t talk about anyone being our most important player without the goalkeeper.",
      "“It is no coincidence with our upturn in form that we have a goalkeeper it seems all our players trust.”",
      "Manchester United fan Usain Bolt is “begging” legend Rio Ferdinand to address the squad as he feels only one man “understands” what is needed of him in an important role.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand insists it was “brilliant” to see Virgil van Dijk call out Wayne Rooney’s criticism of the Liverpool defender.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has rejected Gary Lineker’s claim that Arsenal star Victor Gyokeres must start scoring against top teams to avoid “flat-track bully” label.",
      "Rio Ferdinand doesn’t think £65m for Luis Diaz was “good business” for Liverpool. We’re confident it was very good business, actually.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”."

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "United led through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header until the 84th minute when substitute Mathys Tel's impressive equaliser kick-started a late comeback for Spurs, who led through Richarlison seven minutes later only to let a second home league win of the season slip away.",
      "A knee injury to substitute Benjamin Sesko - after he wasted a glorious chance immediately following Spurs' equaliser - left United down to 10, but they somehow clawed their way back as De Ligt headed in from a corner in the sixth and final minute of stoppage time.",
      "Benjamin Sesko suffered a knee injury at Tottenham and could miss Slovenia's upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The striker will be assessed in the coming days.",
      "Spurs had never taken the lead after the regulation 90 minutes in a Premier League game and not won, while United became the first team in the competition since August 2012 to score the opening goal, go behind and not lose in successive games.",
      "Victory would have taken either side up to second in the table, but neither showed enough to be worthy of that position in a low-quality game reminiscent of last season's Europa League final. Spurs end Saturday fifth, while United are eighth.",
      "Spurs won all four meetings between the sides last season, including the Europa League final in Bilbao, and continue to be a bogey team for United, whose winless run against this opposition now extends to eight games.",
      "Although Spurs avoided defeat showing spirit to fight back, their wretched home form in the league remains a concern, having claimed just one victory from six against Burnley this season. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "Despite United extending their unbeaten league run to five games, head coach Ruben Amorim delivered a reality check after the game as he said \"we have a lot of problems\".",
      "Tottenham: Vicario (5), Porro (4), Romero (6), Van de Ven (7), Spence (6), Sarr (6), Palhinha (7), Johnson (5), Simons (7), Richarlison (7), Kolo Muani (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Odobert (7), Udogie (7),  Bentancur (5), Tel (7).\n\n\nMan Utd Lammens (6), Maguire (6), De Ligt (7) Shaw (5), Mazraoui (5), Casemiro (5), Fernandes (5), Dorgu (5), Amad (7), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (4). \n\n\nSubs:  Sesko (3), Mount (5), Ugarte (5), Dalot (5) Yoro (5).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Spurs fans booed head coach Thomas Frank's decision to remove Xavi Simons when United were leading, only for his replacement, Tel, to bring them level four minutes and 45 seconds after coming on.",
      "\"Sometimes you're lucky,\" said Frank of his substitution. \"Every single time I take a decision to sub a player, it is only with one aim: to win the game.\"",
      "It was another toothless performance from Tottenham for most of the game, as they failed to register a shot on target until the 54th minute, but Frank remained upbeat with United held to a season-low five shots.",
      "\"To play against a Man Utd team that play with confidence with Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko coming on, and we kept them down to five shots,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not that easy just to create in the Premier League, even when they had all their big boys out there. That said, our second-half response I was extremely happy with.\"",
      "\"We're playing home, of course, we all want to win and don't talk too much about home form,\" added Frank, whose side have taken five points from their six league matches at home.",
      "\"I know we need to win before we don't talk about it. But the way we turned around to stay in the game, kept doing the right thing throughout the second half, very, very happy with that. So close to winning it and on any other day, we win it.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was disappointed not to take all three points despite his team being on a five-game unbeaten run, the longest since he has taken charge.",
      "Nottingham Forest scored twice in two minutes to overturn United's advantage in the second half last Saturday before Amad Diallo's stunning volley clawed back a point late on in a 2-2 draw.",
      "It was a case of deja vu at Spurs and Amorim's response delivered a reality check for United, who once again struggled after Casemiro was taken off.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now, and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, that we want the players to behave. We are doing that, and we are improving.",
      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, five have come when Casemiro was on the pitch. The other 15 goals they've shipped have come without him. That pattern was clear in United's 2-2 draw at Spurs.",
      "Casemiro was taken off with less than 20 minutes to go and United leading through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header. Spurs then scored twice late on when he left the field.",

United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",
      "However, Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser extended Spurs' winless home run in the competition to five.",
      "In spite of these struggles, and a raft of injuries with 10 players out, Spurs are still third in the table. Sorting those home struggles is crucial if Spurs are to be contenders.Zinny Boswell",

      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",
      "Had another clean sheet been secured, this wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. But, ultimately, this would be costly.",
      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",

      "Regis Le Bris' side put in a commanding first 45 minutes. And it wasn't by playing the most beautiful football. It was by forcing their opponents to play the game exactly how they wanted it to be played.",
      "The resolute nature of Sunderland's rearguard performance began to irritate the Gunners, and by the time they conceded they were just playing into the hands of the hosts. Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",

      "The Chelsea supporters had been celebrating before kick-off, too, watching Arsenal get pegged back by Sunderland on the TV screens inside the stadium. Those two results, leave Chelsea second in the Premier League title race and just six points off the Gunners.",
      "Are the world champions now Premier League contenders?",
      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",

      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",
      "Even in 20 years time, Tomas Soucek will be scoring goals for West Ham in the Premier League. Probably.",
      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",

      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",

      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",
