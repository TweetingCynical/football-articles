      "Manchester United face Burnley in what is undoubtedly a must-win match for Ruben Amorim. Fortunately for Amorim, United have enjoyed a strong recent record against Burnley, remaining unbeaten in their last seven encounters, with five victories in that span.",
      "However, just three games into the new season, Manchester United find themselves in the midst of a crisis. Their latest setback—a shock defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in the EFL Cup—has ignited a media storm. Doubts about the Portuguese manager were already swirling before the campaign began, and while many were prepared to give him time, United’s poor start has eroded much of the early-season confidence in his leadership.",
      "United’s league opener, a narrow 0-1 loss to Arsenal, was actually a decent performance, but they quickly regressed, delivering a lackluster 1-1 draw away at Fulham. The real damage, though, came in Wednesday night’s EFL Cup tie at Grimsby. United came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2, only to lose 12-11 on penalties—a match they could easily have lost in regular time.",
      "Part-owner Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed Amorim ahead of this weekend’s fixture, but another disappointing performance or result could prove to be the tipping point for some at the club.",
      "Burnley, meanwhile, arrive at Old Trafford with three points from their opening two games. Scott Parker’s side started the season with a 3-0 defeat at Tottenham, but bounced back impressively with a 2-0 win over Sunderland, thanks to goals from Josh Cullen and Jaidon Anthony. Survival remains Burnley’s primary objective this season, but they can be pleased with their start. Despite the heavy loss, their display at Tottenham showed promise, and the victory over Sunderland was vital.",
      "Supporters will be eager to see further reinforcements arrive before the transfer window closes, and are also looking forward to seeing more of new signings like Armando Broja, who has yet to feature prominently in the league.",
      "Burnley’s defensive solidity was a hallmark of their Championship campaign last season, where they conceded just 16 goals in 46 matches. Replicating that defensive resilience will be essential if they are to secure their Premier League status, and they will hope to frustrate a beleaguered Manchester United at Old Trafford, fully aware of the pressure weighing on the hosts.",
      "Matches between these two sides are often closely contested, with both teams scoring in four of their last six meetings. Of United’s last five wins over Burnley, three have been by a two-goal margin and two by a single goal, with their most recent victory a narrow 1-0 win.",

      "There are just three days remaining of the transfer window and Manchester United's work is not done. Some might suggest the club need to be industrious over the weekend following their embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "The Red Devils have already acquired a new frontline in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbuemo and Benjamin Sesko but still have deals to do to satisfy Ruben Amorim's needs. A central midfielder has been among the club's priorities and they were priced out of a deal for Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "The start to United's season has seen a series of errors in goal from Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir. Both players have seen their positions speculated upon but remain at the club despite the 13-times Premier League champions being linked to figures such as Emiliano Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "United want to secure some exits too. Marcus Rashford has been loaned to Barcelona but new clubs are still needed for Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is pushing for a permanent move to Napoli with the midfielder at the centre of a £50million tug of war between the Italian champions and Manchester United. Antonio Conte's side have a four-year contract waiting for the 20-year-old midfielder and and Mainoo has told Red Devils chiefs he wants to go to Serie A.",
      "United have so far blocked the move but Mainoo is adamant that he wants to leave before Monday's transfer deadline. A loan spell had initially been expected but the England international is eyeing a more definite exit.",
      "Mainoo believes Conte could have offer a boost to his footballing career, as he did with Scott McTominay.",
      "Manchester United expect at least three players to depart Old Trafford in the remaining days of the transfer window. The club have agreed a £40m deal with Chelsea for Alejandro Garnacho and are at an advanced stage for two more moves.",
      "There is said to be greater work to do facilitate Jadon Sancho's sale. Roma remain interested in the winger however.",
      "Manchester United have no plans to green light a loan for Kobbie Mainoo. The club maintain that they value the young midfielder despite his lack of playing time.",
      "Mainoo has yet to play a Premier League minute this term and has ambitions of making the England's World Cup squad next summer. United want to see the player fight for his place however despite struggling to break into Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorin breezed into the media room at Manchester United's training ground just after 1pm on Friday, seemingly without a care in the world. With a flash of that megawatt smile, a cheery “Hi guys!” and a wink towards the assembled film cameras, Amorim did not carry the air of a manager in the midst of a full-blown crisis.",
      "But after United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby, on the back of a solitary point from their opening two Premier League games, Amorin finds himself in embattled mode. Less than 48 hours earlier, a bedraggled Amorim, his usually slick curls matted from the teeming Lincolnshire rain, cut a tortured soul as he tried to make sense of his side's capitulation.",
      "He spoke candidly and with raw emotion, admitting he was “shocked” by what he had witnessed from his players, who he claimed had “spoken really loudly about what they want”.",
      "Yet time is a great healer and, a couple of days on from his impassioned pitchside interview at Blundell Park, Amorim tried to qualify his remarks, but succeeded only in confirming himself as a conflicted figure, which does not bode well for the immediate battles ahead that will decide his fate.",
      "After Saturday's must-win Old Trafford clash with Burnley, United's two games after the international break are at Manchester City and at home to Chelsea. Failure to navigate those fixtures with a semblance of positivity and progress could see Amorim's reign come to an end in under a year.",
      "Certainly, as he tried to explain his loaded comments in the immediate aftermath of the Grimsby debacle, Amorim posed more questions than answers about whether he is the right man to try to haul United out of their current slumber and back to competing for the big prizes.",
      "Asked if the EFL Cup exit, the first time United had lost to a fourth tier side in the competition, was down to the wrong attitude from the players, Amorim said: “I don't know what happened.”",
      "Similarly, when pushed on what effect his blunt comments could have on his players, Amorim was his usual candid self, perhaps too honest for his own good, when addressing the fall-out from what he said.",
      "“I'm really honest about what I see,” said Amorim. “I cannot say a different thing. You watched the same game that I watched, so I'm not going to change the narrative or control the narrative.",
      "“It is what it is and I'm just trying to be honest with you guys and with the players. There's no excuse, because I didn't put just 11 players out that hadn't played so much.",
      "“They all played in pre-season, it wasn't just guys from the academy or a mix. I could play that team in the next game. So that's the frustration of a coach and why it's so hard [to accept].”",
      "Amorim's admission that he sometimes wants to quit was delivered tongue in cheek, but before he finished his media duties, he provided further compelling insight into his complex make-up.",
      "Asked who has to talk him out of feeling like quitting after a defeat, Amorim said: “Myself, I just need 10 minutes with myself. I don't need anyone, but I'm going to be like that.",
      "“When you say I want to quit, is that it? I want to quit, I don't love the players, I sometimes hate my kids, so I'm going to be like that. That's not going to change. Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's a funny thing and I'm going to suffer. We just need to win some games.”",
      "A win is what Amorim desperately needs today. Otherwise his suffering and self-recrimination will only increase and nudge him closer to the sack.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have taken a solitary point from their opening two Premier League games to stand 16th in the table, with Amorim conceding there can be no guarantees over his future after such a poor start. Asked if was sure he would still be United boss after the upcoming international break, Amorim said: “I don't know what is going to happen, but that is my idea.",
      "“But again, I'm not going to promise you nothing about what is going to be the future. But I'm the manager of Manchester United and I think that is not going to change.”",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the penalty shot-out defeat at Blundell Park, Amorin said his players had “spoken really loudly about what they want” with their abject performance. That was widely interpreted as Amorim suggesting the display showed his players had lost faith in him and his methods, after nine months in charge.",
      "But Amorim said his remarks were made in the heat of the moment and not to be taken at face value, admitting he allowed emotion to get the better of him following the huge upset.",
      "“Sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players,” said Amorim. “Sometimes I want to quit Sometimes I want o be here for 20 years, sometimes I love my players sometimes I don’t want to be here with them.",
      "“This is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that. I was frustrated and annoyed. I know you have a lot of experienced players saying I should be more calm. But I'm going to be who I am and in that moment I was really upset and disappointed.",

      "Marcus Rashford has put himself in line for the World Cup after making his “big career change.” England boss Thomas Tuchel underlined his admiration for Rashford by giving him a huge vote of confidence and he is the only Manchester United player in the squad to face Andorra and Serbia.",
      "Rashford, 27, is of course on loan from his parent club to Barcelona and it is that brave switch which has really caught Tuchel’s eye and is the reason why he has actually included him as one of three players who can play wide left. Arsenal new boy Eberechi Eze and Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon are also in a fiercely competitive area but Rashford may just be in pole position.",
      "Tuchel says he was impressed when he recalled Rashford last season and is now determined to take his game to another level by joining Barcelona on a season-long loan. Tuchel said: “I think he had a very good camp. He tried very, very hard to be the best version of himself in the first camp. He was in a good moment in Aston Villa.",
      "“I wanted to encourage him and give him as a positive feedback, gave him this camp and the call-up. He did very well. He missed the second camp for us. Now he made a big change, into a new football culture, new country.",
      "“But he started already matches for Barcelona and I wanted to keep him going. It's the one position where we have three players. After long discussions we decided to take three players on this position.",
      "“It's Ebs, Anthony and Marcus. I think Marcus gives us one-on-ones, he gives us the finishing ability, with both feet. He gives us the body and the speed to intimidate opponents and make the difference. It's on him to keep that going.”",
      "Tuchel pulled surprises by excluding Trent Alexander-Arnold, there was no place for Kyle Walker who may get stuck on 96 caps and no recall for Jack Grealish. But in terms of the inclusions, Djed Spence gets the call while Elliot Anderson also got his first senior call-up with the specific idea that England are looking for a new midfield anchorman to give Declan Rice more freedom. Adam Wharton is also in.",
      "Tuchel said: “It will depend on how Adam presents himself and depend how Elliot presents himself. They now have a big chance. They are a bit different players. It depends who we play against. Will the structure be the same against Andorra and in Belgrade? The physicality and the individual quality and the style of the teams we play will be very different - what we face in Belgrade and in Birmingham. Also, we want to see them.",
      "“We value training very highly so we will take this decision when we come to the match. I think all four No.6 and No.8 players we chose can play with each other. We are open for any mix. I don’t want to give too much away because it’s pretty much open.”Meanwhile, Tuchel also admitted that his mission to check out the United States at the Club World Cup this summer has left him with plenty of food for thought ahead of next year. Tuchel added: “It was unbelievably hot. It was very, very hot and very hostile conditions to train and to play. It’s one thing to know it, it’s another thing to feel it, it’s another thing to watch it. It’s another thing to play in it.",
      "“So it was basically just…confirmation of what we thought it would be. The distances will be huge, it will be humid, it will be very, very hot.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Real Betis have issued a statement declaring they have WITHDRAWN their £21.6m offer for Antony - despite agreeing terms with Manchester United for the Brazilian to return.",
      "Antony shone on loan at the Spanish club in the second half of last season, leading them to the UEFA Conference League final, where they were beaten by Chelsea. He returned to Manchester this summer as part of the club's so-called 'bomb squad' - also featuring Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho - and has been keen to return to Seville.",
      "Betis had felt they wouldn't be able to get the funds required to do a deal and United made clear they didn't want another straight loan. But the Spaniards this week pushed the boat out to agree terms with United.",
      "A £21.6m fee was agreed for a player - whom United paid Ajax £81.3m for three years ago - with a further £2.6m in add-ons. United also stood to make 50 percent on any profit that Betis made in any potential future sale of the 25-year-old, who remains United's second-costliest signing of all time, behind Paul Pogba.",
      "Nevertheless, while a deal with United was duly outlined, there were issues that needed to be sorted - not least Antony's salary and the reduction he was about to undertake, given Betis cannot match the £6m-per-year he is paid at Old Trafford.",
      "He has two years left on his deal and wanted the clubs to agree a deal that ensures he doesn't miss out on his money - believed to be around £5m. Neither Betis or United wanted to make up the difference and Antony is believed to be unwilling to waive it. Thus the deal, despite an agreed fee, was left in limbo.",
      "Then, amid leaks from both sides, Betis released a statement late on Friday night declaring: \"There is no agreement and we have withdrawn the transfer offer because Real Betis can't afford the transfer fee and the amounts that Manchester United must [instead] pay the player before the transfer.\"",
      "At Old Trafford, they believe it's merely a bargaining tactic.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another issue that United need to take care of before Monday's transfer deadline - with the England midfielder desperate to move.",
      "Mainoo, left out of Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad on Friday, has effectively been told by Ruben Amorim he'll only play this season when Bruno Fernandes isn't available. As such the 20-year-old wants to leave.",
      "Amorim responded at his pre-Burnley press conference on Friday, declaring: “I want Kobbie to stay,” Amorim said. “He needs to fight for his place, and we need Kobbie.",
      "\"So that is not going to change. The rest I don’t know how it’s going to finish.",
      "“I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. But everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.”",
      "However, that isn't good enough for Mainoo who will respond to his manager's comments by reiterating his desire to leave for regular game time this weekend, before Monday's 7pm deadline.",

      "A troubling trend has developed, with players who struggled to flourish at United being loaned out or sold, only to excel at their new teams. Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa) and Antony (Real Betis) both experienced revivals during loan spells last term, while Anthony Elanga, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Alvaro Carreras have undergone comparable upturns after leaving.",

And Ten Hag was transparent about his feelings regarding McTominay's switch to Naples last summer, insisting it wasn't his choice.",
      "\"I am a little mixed. I am very happy for him but I would prefer not to lose him because he was so important for our team,\" he told reporters shortly after the sale.",
      "\"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it's the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales. Obviously, homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It's not the right thing to do, but for everyone, for all parts, it's a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player, but also for us.\"",
      "Ten Hag, who handed Mainoo his senior debut at United, heaped praise on the midfielder in August 2024 when he suggested the youngster possessed the qualities to eventually become a \"perfect midfielder.\" That assessment related to the youngster's capacity to excel in all facets of his central role.",
      "Previously hailed as the most promising talent to emerge from United's youth setup in recent memory, Mainoo now finds himself marginalised under Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old hasn't featured in the Premier League this season and has sought a move to Napoli too, though United are believed to have blocked that prospect for now.",
      "Garnacho was also championed by his former manager before his standing at Old Trafford plummeted, with the player now destined for a switch to Chelsea. Just 12 months ago, Ten Hag was effusive in his praise of Garnacho, positioning him as one of United's most precious assets.",
      "When the Dutchman was questioned last summer about whether the South American could become one of football's elite, he replied: \"A world-class player? He has to go a long way. He has high potential.",
      "\"He showed last season he can contribute and be a starting XI player. To make the jump and become a world-class player, it starts with very hard work. That brought him to where he is now and that will bring him to being that world-class player. I agree he has the potential.\"",
      "Garnacho's attitude appears to have put him in Amorim's bad books ahead of what seems a probable switch to west London. The Argentinian was forced to train separately from the main group in December 2024, coinciding with reports he and his brother were connected to allegations someone within the team was leaking tactical information.",
      "Across the last two campaigns, only skipper Bruno Fernandes (34 goals) and frontman Rasmus Hojlund (26) have netted more times than Garnacho (21) among United players. For a side that has struggled going forward, it's understandable why some fans don't want to see the winger go.",
      "United faced ridicule from supporters for offloading McTominay for under £30million considering his rapid success in Italy. Mainoo might remain for now, but there's genuine concern the £40m price-tag placed on 21-year-old Chelsea-bound Garnacho suggests the same mistake could happen again.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "“So I'm trying to accept that and I'm going to be who I am. That's why I have the passion that I have. At that moment I was really upset and really disappointed, because I felt that we had a very good pre-season, we were playing better, we were being consistent in the way we played. We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham.",
      "“With that kind of performance, I was really disappointed with everything. But now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next one. I'm just focused on this game and I need to live this day by day. I understand that. And I'm going to be like that all the time. So prepare yourself.",
      "“If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that are good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin.",
      "“So I understand that. And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don't want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It's going to be hard.”",
      "Amorim insisted he wants Kobbie Mainoo to stay, after the United and England midfielder asked to leave on loan because of a lack of playing time.",

      "Mainoo believes a move to Napoli could have the same effect on his career, but United have so far blocked his exit. And Ferdinand wants Mainoo to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford.",
      "In response to the news, Ferdinand said: \"I don't want to hear that. So Kobbie, if you're watching, please don't let me hear that, please man, I need you to stay at the club. Be patient please, I know it's difficult. It's easy for me to say, but I want to see you here.",
      "\"You couldn't have bet me any money that after his exploits with England that we'd be sitting here going, 'Kobbie Mainoo can't get in the Man United team, they're thinking about selling him and he wants to go'.\"",
      "Mainoo has been an unused substitute in United's opening Premier League games, with manager Ruben Amorim stating that the 20-year-old is competing with club captain Bruno Fernandes for a spot in the team.",
      "\"Mainoo is fighting for his position with Bruno,\" Amorim said after United's 1-1 draw with Fulham. \"I changed two midfielders, I left Mason Mount there because we wanted to score a goal and when I changed, I felt the team needed one holding midfielder. So he needs to fight for his position with Bruno. At the moment he is fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Mainoo did make his first start of the season in United's humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby on Wednesday, but struggled to make much of an impact. And if he does end up staying at United, Ferdinand has urged Mainoo to make sure that he is ready to make the most of any opportunities he gets.",
      "\"We've all had these moments in our careers where you're like, 'S*** man, I'm not playing. What do I do?' Well, the first thing you do is go to the manager and go, 'What am I not doing that I need to be doing to get in this team?' Right. He's going to tell me. Then I go to work on a training pitch.",
      "\"Every day I go to work. I play up against whoever, Bruno [Fernandes] etc, and I start dominating them. Just that's the type of mentality and mindset he has to go with. And then when the chance comes to play, take it with both hands.",
      "\"Now his argument right now will be I'm not getting the chance to take it. And that's a fair argument. But what I would say is do not let the chance come and you're not ready. So train hard, be focused.\"",

      "Manchester United chiefs will be hoping Ruben Amorim can turn his fortunes around as serious concerns have been raised over the club's mindset. The Portuguese head coach is currently under huge pressure after the Red Devils were dumped out of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night after losing to League Two side Grimsby on penalties.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss himself appeared to voice doubts over whether he's the right man for the job in the wake of United's latest humiliation. However, the possibility of ditching Amorim just ten months into his tenure poses a serious problem for the club's hierarchy after backing him to the tune of more than £200million during the summer transfer window.",
      "And former United goalkeeper Ben Foster says they will just have to keep their fingers crossed for now that he delivers. Even so, the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper suggested they should switch focus if they do decided to dispense with Amorim's services by bringing in a manager who can fix the Premier League giants' weak mentality.",
      "The 42-year-old reckons they could do a lot worse than appoint former England boss Gareth Southgate as his replacement to achieve that aim if it comes down to it.",
      "Speaking during an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"I don't know what the answer is, because if you look at the history of recent managers for Man United, you've had some proper big boys in there. You've had Jose Mourinho, Van Gaal and Solskjaer, when he was doing fantastic for a little while.",
      "\"I don't know whether they need to adopt a completely fresh approach. The pressure that's involved in playing for that club is like nowhere else and maybe they've got to go a different way. Even if it's somebody like Gareth Southgate, just give it a go.",
      "He added: \"It's somebody that's going to maybe change the mentality of the players and take a more pragmatic approach, because I think what they're doing just isn't working at the moment.",
      "\"They've put all their eggs in this basket with Ruben Amorim and they're just going to have to try and ride it out. The top brass at that club are hoping and praying to god that it turns around.\"",
      "Southgate is one of the bookies' favourites to replace Amorim if he is removed from his post. The 54-year-old has been without a job since stepping down from his England role after they lost to Spain in the Euro 2024 final.",
      "Meanwhile, Foster has criticised Amorim's negative body language during United's cup exit against Grimsby. The manager appeared unable to watch the penalty shootout at times and later criticised his players after the match.",
      "Foster, who spent five years at Old Trafford between 2005 and 2010 said: \"It's tough going at the minute. I thought in the summer that they've got this big, new energy, with some fantastic signings, and it's all going to be different.",
      "\"The first few weeks of the season, it seems to be pretty much the same old really. The other night against Grimsby was just the epitome of it as well. The worry of it was seeing the manager in the dugout.",
      "\"It's really not a good look if you're on the pitch about to take your penalties, and you look back in the dugout, and the manager is sitting there and he's burying his head in his hands. It doesn't scream that we're all in this together.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could be on the verge of a Manchester United exit, and the Red Devils could be losing a player Alejandro Garnacho once hailed as the \"the best player in the squad.\" While Garnacho's future also looks set to lie elsewhere, with a move to Chelsea pending, Mainoo could be in line to join Serie A champions Napoli before Monday's transfer deadline with the midfielder pushing for a move.",
      "Mainoo, 20, was once considered as a key component of United's future due to his performances over the last two seasons. The youngster racked up an impressive collection of wonder goals and earned his England debut just over a year ago.",
      "He also claimed the man of the match performance in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2024 after scoring the winner. It was in the aftermath of the game against City where Garnacho showered his team-mate with the highest praise.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, alongside Mainoo, Garnacho reflected on the midfielder's instrumental contribution to the victory.",
      "\"Just incredible,\" Garnacho said. \"I always say, for me, he's the best player in the squad and he's the youngest. We are also very good friends so I am very happy for him\" Upon handing the man of the match trophy to Mainoo, Garnacho said: \"My man, I love you.\"",
      "With a squad littered with talent, it spoke volumes to Mainoo's ability, that at just 20, he was given such an accolade. The England midfielder’s club contract runs until 2027 at United but negotiations over an extension have stalled.",
      "The Italian champions reportedly have a four-year contract waiting for Mainoo, with the player having told United bosses he wants to go to Serie A, but on a permanent deal.",
      "United, however, are rightfully mindful of the stunning impact made by another of their cast-offs at Napoli, Scott McTominay, and have so far blocked Mainoo's move. Although they are said to value him at £50million and will listen to offers.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has started just 16 out of 44 games, and he was left on the bench for the second successive Premier League match this season as United drew 1-1 with Fulham on Sunday. However, Mainoo did play the full 90 minutes in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "A social media video of Mainoo at the full-time whistle at Fulham also went viral, as it showed the youngster looking despondent, with rumours of his potential departure continuing to grow ahead of Monday's deadline.",
      "Meanwhile, United have agreed a £40m deal with Chelsea for Garnacho. It comes after he had fallen out of favour with Amorim in recent months.",
      "The Red Devils have secured a 10 per cent sell-on fee after United dug their heels in and stood firm on their valuation of Garnacho, having rejected Chelsea's initial offer of £25m. Garnacho was left out of United's starting line-up for their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and publicly criticised Amorim in the immediate aftermath of the loss in Bilbao.",
      "Should Mainoo make a move to Napoli he will be hoping to emulate the success of McTominay. The Scotsman was allowed to leave Old Trafford last summer for Antonio Conte's side in a £25m switch.",
      "He has since left produced a string of man of the match performances domestically, and in Europe, to become the first Scot to be shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or since former Rangers striker Ally McCoist in 1987.",

      "Following a shocking Carabao Cup defeat to League Two's Grimsby Town, the heat is certainly on Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim. Many would argue that it's only August, we're just three games into the season, and the club still has some business to sort in the transfer market – but, all the optimism built up in pre-season is fading fast.",
      "The first international break of the season is looming, and the pressure is mounting on Amorim. United must secure a win against Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The Clarets are one of the favourites to suffer relegation from the Premier League, so anything less than a victory for United will be seen as a disappointment. Off the back of the embarrassing Grimsby defeat, crunch talks are planned for the Portuguese boss – and he has hinted discussions will take place behind the scenes after the Burnley clash.",
      "Speaking after their Carabao Cup exit, Amorim said: \"Let’s focus on the next game and then we have time to think about things. We have a lot of debts with our fans so let’s focus on the game.\"",
      "He added: \"We have a job to do, a job to prepare and then we’ll stop and think things through.\"",
      "So, fans may be wondering if Burnley's visit is the make-or-break for Amorim – but he could call in his previous good graces with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The United chief praised the head coach just months ago, and it is safe to assume this would still be his stance now. Speaking to the BBC in March, Ratcliffe said: \"I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do.",
      "\"I think he is an excellent manager and I think he'll be there for a long time.\"",
      "United have had their fair share of managers since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, leading many to believe that the club should stick with Amorim in the hope he can turn things around. Nearly every United fan agreed that he needed a full pre-season and summer transfer window before they could make a solid judgement.",
      "However, after the manner of Wednesday night's loss on the Lincolnshire coast, questions are being raised about the Portuguese boss just three games into the season.",
      "It seems improbable that United will axe Amorim at this stage, but previous sackings have proven that nothing is impossible in Manchester.",
      "United look to be crying out for stability after numerous years of uncertainty. Amorim was regarded as one of Europe's brightest coaching talents last year and represented United's primary choice to succeed Erik ten Hag last November, suggesting he retains the backing of the club's leadership.",
      "Speaking in the same interview he conducted earlier this year, Ratcliffe added: \"I think if you look at the squad he has got at his disposal, with the injury list he has got at his disposal, and he comes in mid-season where he has had no time to train the players in his style of play, I think he has done really well.",
      "\"I think you are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce.\"",
      "To Amorim's credit, United have shown flashes of their potential under his guidance. But, with just four victories from their previous 17 matches spanning the summer break, the mounting pressure is proving to be increasingly challenging for Amorim.",

      "Grimsby Town owner Jason Stockwood has revealed he was left baffled when a Manchester United official asked him where Ruben Amorim's dressing room was. Stockwood, 55, watched his side complete one of the biggest shocks in League Cup history when the Mariners overcame the Red Devils in a penalty shootout.",
      "Initially, it appeared the League Two side's hearts were going to be broken, as they allowed a 2-0 lead to slip from their grasp. After Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren both took advantage of poor goalkeeping from Andre Onana in the first half, Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire found the net after the break to level the game.",
      "However, a marathon penalty shootout saw Grimsby win 12-11, sparking scenes of jubilation at Blundell Park. After the game, Stockwood revealed an amusing exchange he had with an official at United, which highlighted the stark difference in the clubs' sizes.",
      "Speaking to the Athletic, Stockwood said: \"I'll tell you one funny quick thing. With Manchester United coming to town, they sent us almost a rider for the manager, and it was like, 'Where's the manager's changing room?'",
      "\"And I was like, 'F***ing hell, the manager's changing room?' For us, it is the back of his car. The manager has a changing room at Man United? I thought that was quite amusing.\"",
      "Grimsby's triumph saw them become the first ever club from the fourth division in English football to knock United out of a cup competition. It was another poor showing from the Red Devils, who are yet to win a game in the new campaign.",
      "Initially, there was plenty of promise after they pushed Arsenal all the way at Old Trafford before losing 1-0 to the north Londoners. A sticky 1-1 draw away to Fulham brought United down a peg, but the loss to Grimsby has seen the mood at Old Trafford nosedive.",
      "After watching United arrive, Stockwood noted the Red Devils players looked unprepared for the rainy and physical challenge facing them at Blundell Park. He added: \"They clearly didn't know what they were coming into.",
      "\"When the players came off the bus and onto the pitch, I stood around and the United players did not look like they were up for it. It was all the cliches.",
      "\"They have got all those incredible talents and I'm a massive fan of the Premier League. The individual talent on display last night was extraordinary.",
      "\"The team performance speaks for itself from United. But seeing them coming in, they did not look like they wanted to be there, which I really enjoyed!\"",
      "United face another uncomfortable challenge on the weekend as they host Burnley at Old Trafford. The newly promoted side have their tails up after beating Sunderland in their last Premier League clash, before overcoming Derby County 2-1 in the League Cup.",
      "Considering the mood within and outside United, a clash against Scott Parker's side may be an uncomfortable prospect. United desperately need a victory as they travel to fierce rivals Manchester City and host Chelsea in their next Premier League games.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is at the centre of a bizarre £50million tug of war between Italian champions Napoli and Manchester United.",
      "The Italian champions - who are now targeting the Champions League - have a four-year contract waiting for the 20-year-old midfielder. And Mainoo has told United bosses he wants to go to Serie A - on a permanent deal.",
      "United, mindful of the stunning impact made by another of their rejects, Scott McTominay, have so far blocked the move.",
      "But Mainoo is adamant that he wants to leave before Monday's transfer deadline.",
      "Midfielder McTominay was allowed to leave Old Trafford last summer for Antonio Conte ’s Napoli in a £25million switch.",
      "He has since left produced a string of game-changing performances domestically and in Europe to become the first Scot to be shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or since former Rangers striker Ally McCoist in 1987. McTominay was also named last season’s MVP award - in his debut season at Napoli.",
      "Under Conte, McTominay - much derided and eventually sidelined at Old Trafford - was instrumental in the club’s title success.",
      "The 28-year-old scored 12 times in 34 league appearances and provided a crucial goal on the final day of the season to secure the Scudetto.",
      "Mainoo believes Conte could have a similar effect on his own footballing future and, as a result, wants to leave on a permanent basis rather than on loan as had been previously believed.",
      "Conte believes his quick feet, impressive passing range and speed in tight spaces will help his side as Napoli defend their title and target the Champions League.",
      "Still highly rated by many United fans, the England midfielder’s club contract runs until 2027 but negotiations over an extension have stalled.",
      "It is also understood United would be willing to listen to offers for him as his regular first-team opportunities have stalled under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mainoo played the full 90 minutes in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "Before that, however, he was an unused substitute for United's opening two Premier League games with Amorim insistent he is fighting for a place with skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Stockport-born Mainoo has had an unhappy 12 months at Old Trafford since his fabulous end to the 2023-24 campaign which saw him play at the European Championships with England.",
      "His confidence and form dipped, and he was injured when Erik ten Hag was sacked and Amorim took his place.",
      "As the players struggled with the Portuguese head coach’s system of three at the back, Mainoo was involved in a string of damaging defeats.",
      "Injury struck again in February and, by the time he returned, Amorim’s focus on the Europa League limited his chances.",
      "McTominay, however, is not the only player to have left United and since flourished. Antony was outstanding at Betis and Marcus Rashford helped Aston Villa to the brink of the Champions League semi-finals, earning himself a move to Barcelona.",
      "Chelsea have seen enough in winger Alejandro Garnacho to invest £40million. Now Napoli are determined to take their push for Mainoo to Monday’s transfer deadline wire.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney believes \"something's broken\" at Old Trafford following the club's humiliating League Cup exit to Grimsby. And it's Ruben Amorim's post-match comments about his squad that have left United's all-time top scorer concerned.",
      "The Red Devils crashed out of the competition's second round on Wednesday after losing 12-11 on penalties to the Mariners. United fought back from two goals behind to level and force a shootout, only to endure fresh heartbreak as another miserable start to a campaign continued.",
      "Amorim, who is reportedly set for crunch talks with his employers, sparked concern after the match when he declared: \"My players spoke for me, really loud.\" Some took this to suggest the manager believes his squad's display reflected their commitment levels towards their boss.",
      "Following a record-low 15th-place Premier League finish last term and a raft of new arrivals, many anticipated improvement from United this season. But an opening-day loss at home to Arsenal, followed by a frustrating stalemate at Fulham and their collapse at Grimsby, indicates further suffering awaits.",
      "\"His words were damning on the players. If your manager comes out with those words, there's something broken.\"",
      "Legions of United supporters would share that view. The years following Sir Alex Ferguson's departure have been littered with let-downs, and there's no obvious sign improvements are on the horizon.",
      "Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was at the helm when the club secured the FA Cup last year, having captured the League Cup the season prior. And precisely when it appeared United couldn't perform worse than their then-record-low eighth-place finish under the Dutchman, Amorim failed to lift results as they tumbled into the bottom half.",
      "There is now growing speculation suggesting Amorim could face the axe before completing his first year at Old Trafford. And Rooney's remarks highlight a worry that the manager himself may be losing belief in what can be achieved with his current squad.",
      "\"What we forget is he's only 40. He's a young manager,\" added Rooney. \"Manchester United is so different to where he's been before. You come in and there's the media team, the commercial team, the fans and the media.",
      "\"There's a pressure with United, which he will never have felt before. When you're not winning games, that can start to get [to you], and it looked like he was at a breaking point.\"",
      "One persistent critique that's emerged regarding United's players in the post-Ferguson era is an absence of leadership despite Amorim's finest efforts to address that problem. Ferguson deliberately identified and signed players with particular character traits throughout his 27-year reign at Old Trafford.",
      "The lack of similar personalities to those under the Scot's reign may be the biggest difference between his success and the subsequent 12 years. This shortfall could potentially trigger another leadership change, and Rooney's concerns about Amorim's attitude may signal cause for alarm.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have no plans to green light Kobbie Mainoo's request for a loan move away - maintaining that they value the young midfielder despite his lack of playing time.",
      "Mainoo is yet to play a minute of Premier League football after the opening two games of the season and has told the hierarchy that he'd like to pursue a temporary move away from Old Trafford, especially with the World Cup coming up in the summer.",
      "However the BBC has claimed that those in Manchester have told the 20-year-old they want him to remain where he is to fight for his place. Chelsea have previously been linked with the player, who would represent pure profit due to his academy status.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in the loss to Arsenal and then the draw ay Fulham. Ruben Amorim has instead preferred to use Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro as the two midfielders in his system, leaving Mainoo to watch on from the sidelines. Manuel Ugarte has twice appeared from the bench above of the academy graduate.",
      "He did get his first outing of the season in United's embarrassing Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby in midweek, which will have done little to aid Mainoo's chances of more involvement. The midfielder had enjoyed a rapid rise under Erik ten Hag, but that has stalled since Amorim arrived.",
      "The Portuguese coach has been happy to speak publicly regarding what he demands from the midfielder. \"The same as any player in that position. I expect a lot from Kobbie Mainoo,\" he said after leaving him out of the draw with Fulham.",
      "\"Again, people think that sometimes you need to just give... I think it is important for Kobbie to fight for his place. I believe a lot in Kobbie; more than what everyone thinks. I believe a lot in Kobbie. I expect a lot from him. He is playing in one position and is fighting with Bruno. They can play together.\"",
      "Mainoo's previous rise was such that he played in the Euro 2024 final for England less than a year after making his United debut. His presence at Old Trafford also helps retain a proud 88 year record of the club always boasting an academy graduate in their matchday squad – a staggering run of 4,324 matches.",
      "Back in April the United boss highlighted the areas where he wanted to see more from Mainoo. \"I think that is also a little bit the problem,\" he said. \"When I see Kobbie Mainoo, I see a lot of talent but in the way I see it – I could be wrong, that is for sure – I see some things that Kobbie Mainoo has to improve. The pace during the game, he has qualities we can use, in build-up he needs to improve.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko wasn't one of Manchester United's selected penalty takers because he had cramp, it's been claimed. Ruben Amorim’s side suffered a humiliating penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby on Wednesday and the striker has found himself in the spotlight after being United's last outfield player to take a spot kick.",
      "Sesko joined United from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million earlier this summer, being the third forward through the door after the earlier arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The 22-year-old had come on as a substitute in United’s first two Premier League games but was trusted from the start against League Two side Grimsby at Blundell Park.",
      "The Slovenia international had six shots in total, with two being on target, but failed to find a winner for the Red Devils, who forced a penalty shootout after being 2-0 down at half-time. However, Sesko’s place in United’s list of penalty takers arguably captured more attention than his overall performance, though a potential reason for him taking the 10th spot kick has emerged.",
      "BBC Sport reports that Sesko was listed as United’s last outfield penalty taker as he had been experiencing cramp. The defeat to Grimsby was the first 90 minutes the striker had completed since scoring for Leipzig in a 1-1 draw with Holstein Kiel on April 19.",
      "Sesko did score United’s 10th penalty to level the shootout at 9-9 before goalkeepers Andre Onana and Christy Pym also found the net. The order then restarted, with Grimsby winning 12-11 on penalties after a miss from Mbeumo.",
      "The striker suffering from cramp would explain why Amorim was perhaps reluctant to rely on him. However, defenders Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt all stepping up before him did little to instill confidence around Sesko at the start of his United career.",
      "Amorim has already explained that he's still adapting to English football after arriving from Germany, unlike Cunha and Mbeumo, who were signed from Wolves and Brentford, respectively. Sesko’s initial displays have prompted a slight concern from pundits, but Amorim called for patience.",
      "“He needs time. It’s not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast,” the United boss said after his team’s draw with Fulham last weekend. “He is learning the game is faster than the Bundesliga, but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "When asked why Sesko was named a substitute, Amorim added: “We tried to imagine what is going to happen during the game. Our team needs to be consistent in the way that we control the game and we need to have options to play a different game on the bench.",
      "“Sesko has had two weeks for us, he is trying to understand everything. We need to wait a little bit to help the player. We just want to win the game and try to help all of our players.”",
      "United will hope to respond positively to their Carabao Cup exit when they host Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday. It remains to be seen whether Sesko will keep his place in attack or again be named on the bench in the Premier League. However, Amorim made his feelings clear about the team after United’s shock defeat in midweek.",
      "\"I know that the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch,” he said after the Grimsby defeat. “I think the team and the players spoke really loud today. So that's it.",
      "\"We lost, the best team won. I think it was really clear for everybody what happened today. It's not just the space [we gave them], but the way we started the game without any intensity - we were completely lost.",
      "\"It's hard to explain. That's why I think they spoke really well. I think they gave the response on the pitch today. When you see something that, like today, it's hard to talk.\"",

      "Talks are planned over how to get the team out of the mess they find themselves in, reports the Telegraph, but Amorim has cast doubt over whether he is the man to lead the revival having struggled to find the answers thus far.",
      "If Amorim does leave - whether by his own choosing or because he's axed - then he could find himself on the radar of Benfica. He played for years with the Portuguese giants and their presidential candidate, Joao Noronha Lopes, is a big fan.",
      "Lopes announced this week that he will be assisted in his campaign by Nuno Gomes, the former Benfica and Portugal frontman, who is also one of Amorim’s closest friends.",
      "Amorim's stock in his homeland remains sky high. He began his managerial career impressively with Braga before Sporting spent big to hire him. There he would make them Portugal's dominant force and end their 19 year wait for a league title, adding more honours after that.",
      "Lopes has been quizzed about Amorim previously and didn't hide his admiration as told Record: “He’s an excellent coach, under contract with Manchester United. I won’t destabilise Benfica. They have a very important match ahead of them.”",
      "United face a huge decision regarding Amorim, whom they have just backed with more than £200million worth of new talent in the summer. Much of that was bought to aid his system, which he has defiantly stuck to despite it not bringing the results many had hoped.",
      "It is almost a year since Ineos axed Erik ten Hag, just months after backing him with a new contract despite the warning signs being in clear view.

      "\"Ultimately, though, there is a different set of managers that you have got to be looking at because of the situation that United are in. I would take Zidane, but is he the right man for the job at Manchester United [as we] speak at the moment and how we see them, probably not.",
      "\"My honest opinion is that you have to look at the jobs that Sean Dyche has done at Burnley, what he did at Everton. He stabilised the club, at least he is going to put structure in there. What Manchester United need right now is structure.",

      "United host Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday before the first round of internationals this season and resume their campaign against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on September 14.",
      "Amorim said at his pre-match press conference that \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\", a comment that United sources claimed was tongue in cheek and a rationale for his emotional nature after matches.",
      "The United head coach is expected to hold further discussions with members of the club's leadership team during the internationals. United usually start planning for the summer transfer window the following year in September.",
      "Amorim said during pre-season that to \"walk away is more an ego thing\". When asked if he can say with absolute certainty that he will be the United manager after the international break, Amorim replied: \"I don't know what is going to happen. That is my idea [to stay], but again, I am not going to promise you nothing, what is going to be the future.",

      "\"And sometimes it's that small difference that changes the narrative and you can see it in one week, it looks like a different club.",
      "\"There's no excuse (for the Grimsby debacle), because I didn't put just 11 players that don't play so much, they played in pre-season, it was not just guys that are from the academy, a mix, no, it was in the right position.",
      "\"I could play that team the next game. We had Kobbie (Mainoo), Manu (Ugarte), Harry Maguire, (Matheus) Cunha, (Benjamin) Sesko, Amad, Diogo (Dalot), Patrick (Dorgu). So that is the frustration of a coach, so that's why it's hard.",
      "\"I don't know what happened, but in the normal day, so much better.\"",
      "Amorim was in a jocular mood at his pre-match press conference, despite the humiliation at Grimsby. He admitted sometimes \"I just need 10 minutes with myself alone\" to talk him out of quitting.",

      "\"Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's a funny thing, I'm going to suffer. We just need to win some games. So we cannot change that fact. We need to focus on the next game, and if we start winning, things are going to be easier to do.\"",

      "The Portuguese revealed that he spent all of his playing career with Belenenses, Benfica, Braga and Al Wakrah playing in back-four formations and the only one he did not operate in was in a back three.",
      "\"Guys, if I feel that it's best to change... I played all my life in the 4-4-2, 4-3-3. The only system that I didn't play one minute: 3-4-3,\" Amorim said. \"I just have one idea that we need to be so good in this way of playing, then we are going to adapt.",
      "\"It's like some coaches have a mentality that I'm going to put this system, and then I'm going to change. What I'm thinking is that we have one system that is going to adapt to different systems, and then when everyone is doing this with his eyes shut, I'm going to change a lot of things.",
      "\"You cannot tell me that we are always with five defenders. You cannot tell me that we are always with four defenders. You cannot tell me that we are always with three defenders. I'm just trying to coach my players with the idea that I have.",
      "\"And I said that many times, this is the fun part. If it's just to win the game or to play in the 4-3-3, I was not here. They asked me before I arrived here, can you play this system? I will say, I will do my system no matter what. If it's okay for you, it's okay.",
      "\"And then in the future, I could change. I could wake up in one morning and say, I understand that for my idea of football, it's better to change right away.",
      "\"I just want to win. But if I'm going to change because something is not working and I don't believe, players will understand. This guy is telling you one thing, he's not believing in the other thing.",
      "\"So it's not about the system. We lost against Grimsby about the system? In the first half, I didn't know the system of the team!",
      "\"So, guys, it’s not the system.\"",

      "Manchester United will be determined to issue a much-needed response when they face Burnley at Old Trafford in the Premier League this afternoon.",
      "United exited the Carabao Cup at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town in midweek, losing 12-11 on penalties, after fighting back from 2-0 down to take the second round tie to a penalty shootout.",
      "After Bryan Mbeumo's second effort of the shootout hit the woodwork, it meant Grimsby progressed, leaving United to focus on the Premier League until the FA Cup third round comes around in January.",
      "Having failed to win any of their opening three games this season, United head coach Ruben Amorim is already under mounting pressure ahead of the clash with Burnley. But how do our writers think the Portuguese chief should set his team up?",
      "Tom Heaton should start. He should have started against Arsenal and his experience with Burnley could count for something.",
      "Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are United's best available centre backs. United need a firmer back three as they should have Kobbie Mainoo in midfield with Bruno Fernandes. Patrick Dorgu continues to start by default.",
      "Benjamin Sesko needed a start sooner than midweek and that has cost him in today's personal line-up. Mason Mount has earned the right to keep his place in the league.",
      "Bayindir gives you a heart attack at set-pieces and Onana is a calamity waiting to happen. With that said, I would give Heaton a go in goal against his former club.",
      "Yoro should return after playing no part in the trip to Lincolnshire, likewise Shaw. They were both rested.",
      "United have no choice but to attack from the off in this game, meaning Mainoo, despite the current uncertainty surrounding his future, should be deployed in midfield next to Fernandes. They should both get United up the pitch.",
      "Mbeumo got off the mark in United colours after coming off the bench at Blundell Park and should start in attack alongside Sesko and Cunha.",

      "There was the familiar \"Hi guys\" when Ruben Amorim entered the vast press conference room at Carrington. It was constructed so vastly in adherence with Uefa guidelines. Manchester United will not be participating in any of Uefa's three competitions this season.",
      "And they are already one domestic cup competition down. All of the permanent post-Ferguson managers met their own Waterloo, a defeat that may still give them flashbacks: Olympiakos, Midtjylland, Sevilla, Liverpool and Brentford. For Amorim, it is Grimsby.",
      "Amorim was not averse to some gallows humour. \"It's not about the system,\" he protested. \"We lost against Grimsby about the system? In the first half, I didn't know the system of the team!\"",
      "He suggested in pre-season he would not be as honest and last week Amorim spoke so slowly it was possible to keep up with the transcription. No need to clear space on the back page for him.",
      "This week, he has favoured those raw reactions that have endeared him to the majority of United supporters and banked goodwill even amid the club's worst season in 51 years. He will be plastered across back-page splashes on Saturday morning.",
      "Amorim is a press officer's nightmare. In 15 minutes on Friday, he uttered the sentences, \"sometimes I want to quit\", \"sometimes I hate my players\", \"I sometimes hate my kids\" and could not promise that he will still be in charge after the September internationals.",
      "\"I'm just explaining what you saw is what I saw, what everyone saw,\" Amorim stressed. \"And I tell the truth, sometimes I'm thinking about, especially in a press conference, what I'm going to say. After these kind of moments, I'm not thinking about that. I'm really honest on what I see.",
      "\"I cannot say a different thing. You watched the same game that I watched. I'm not going to change the narrative or control the narrative. It is what it is, and I'm just trying to be honest with you guys and with the players.\"",
      "He is not the only one at United partial to gallows humour. One staff member joked whether it would be Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Jose Mourinho to take interim charge. The two former United managers were sacked in successive days by Istanbul clubs Besiktas and Fenerbahce this week.",
      "Both would walk to Manchester to replace Amorim. The Grimsby result is a reminder we should never be surprised by anything at United.",
      "Amorim suggested some of the players feel the club is cursed. \"I feel that the players are always thinking about the past. They think there is something in the water here, or in the food. It's nothing, it's in our minds.",
      "\"And we just need to focus on the next game. We dropped the level. Now we have to respond in the next game, it's not about the result, it's the way we play.",
      "\"So, last game we had some moments that I had that feeling, that when it's tough, everyone is trying to do his own thing, and that is something that we need to change, that feeling. Sometimes things are okay, sometimes we are in a bad moment, but we have a way to do things, and we have to work on that.",
      "\"So to work on that is just the next game, it doesn't matter what is in the past, let's focus on the next game so we can respond tomorrow.\"",
      "Who talks him out of quitting? \"Myself! I just need 10 minutes with myself alone. I don't need anyone, but I'm going to be like that.",
      "\"When you say I want to quit, it's that, 'f*****g, I want to quit, I don't love the players'. I sometimes hate my kids, so I'm going to be like that! That is not going to change.",
      "\"Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's a funny thing, I'm going to suffer. We just need to win some games. So we cannot change that fact. We need to focus on the next game, and if we start winning, things are going to be easier to do.\"",
      "Amorim was partial to some self-deprecation. Was he confident in his own ability to take United forward? \"Yes. It depends on the day!\" he chuckled.",
      "\"But I'm confident because I saw these players play really well in tough matches and I see it in training, the training is so much better.\"",
      "He scoffed at the mention of \"surprise\" at the Grimsby debacle. \"I was not surprised, I was shocked in the last game, I was shocked. That's why you see that game, this is not our team, the way we are doing things. So I'm always confident in the way I manage the team.",
      "\"And then I'm trying to remind myself if Bruno (Fernandes) scores that penalty, if we have three first opportunities against Fulham, we score a goal. Things will be really different, and sometimes it's that small difference that changes the narrative and you can see it in one week, it looks like a different club.\"",
      "The gathering started and ended with an address to us guys: \"Guys, it’s not the system.\"",

      "Manchester United will be eyeing a first victory of the campaign when they welcome Burnley to Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "The Reds, who are unbeaten in their last seven meetings with the Clarets, exited the Carabao Cup in shock circumstances in midweek, losing 12-11 on penalties to League Two side Grimsby Town after a 2-2 stalemate.",
      "As a result, United have failed to win any of their opening three games in league and cup this season and pressure is quickly mounting on head coach Ruben Amorim, who has overseen just five Premier League victories this calendar year.",
      "After leaving Andre Onana out of his starting line-ups for the opening two Premier League games of the season, Amorim recalled the Cameroonian against Grimsby, but his performance saw him drop a clanger for the Mariners' second goal after he had failed to cover himself in glory for their first, meaning Altay Bayindir could return at his expense.",
      "Both Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw were left out of the squad that travelled to the Lincolnshire coast, meaning they should return and reclaim their places in the starting line-up.",
      "Harry Maguire, who scored a late equaliser in midweek, will hope to stay in the middle of the back-three after replacing Matthijs de Ligt, but the Dutchman will want his place back after starting on the bench.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu were two of only three players that kept their places in the starting line-up against Grimsby from the 1-1 draw with Fulham three days earlier, and they are likely to retain their places again and occupy the two wing-back positions.",
      "Amad, just like the rest of his teammates, was nowhere near his best in midweek and Dorgu is continuing to start at left wing-back by default.",
      "United's midfield is already proving to be a problem this season, meaning Amorim has a big call to make in the engine room. However, Bruno Fernandes is a guaranteed starter amid his status as captain.",
      "Casemiro has started the opening two league games of the season next to Fernandes, meaning it would be no surprise to see him recalled after remaining on the bench against Grimsby. However, Kobbie Mainoo will be determined to keep his place.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, who came off the bench to score his first United goal in midweek, and Matheus Cunha should occupy the two No.10 spots. Benjamin Sesko will fancy his chances of making his first Premier League start after playing the full 90 minutes in midweek.",
      "United predicted XI vs Burnley: Bayindir; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news, views and rumours on Saturday, August 30.",
      "The summer transfer window is set to officially close next Monday (September 1) at 7pm. United are aware that they need to act swiftly to finalise any remaining deals - and it appears their next summer signing could be imminent.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is poised to make his move to M16 after being absent from his team's match against Mechelen last weekend. The 22-year-old is anticipated to complete a £17million transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "This acquisition is likely to cast further doubt on the futures of both Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır. United had also been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma, but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper now seems destined for Manchester City.",
      "The Reds have also been strongly linked with a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, although Seagulls manager Fabian Hurzeler has once again asserted that the Cameroonian is not leaving.",
      "In other news, Reds captain Bruno Fernandes continues to be a target for clubs in Saudi Arabia, while the futures of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Rasmus Højlund remain up in the air.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is being linked with a move away from Manchester United this summer.",
      "Mainoo broke through as one of Europe's brightest talents under Erik ten Hag in 2023/24. The midfielder scored in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City before earning a call-up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024 where he started in the final against Spain.",
      "But the 20-year-old has struggled for game time since Ruben Amorim replaced Ten Hag at Old Trafford in November last year. The Reds academy graduate has yet to start for Amorim's men in the Premier League this season and struggled like most of his teammates in Wednesday's shock League Cup defeat at Grimsby Town.",
      "Read more here",
      "United are in the market for a new midfielder and Brighton star Carlos Baleba is said to be their top target.",
      "However, the Seagulls are demanding more than £100m for the 21-year-old and Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler believes Baleba will not be going anywhere this summer. When asked is he is 100 per cent confident the player will stay, he replied: \"Yes.",
      "\"If there is a number more than 100 - I would even say more than 100. I am confident, yes.\"",
      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage this morning.",
      "The Reds return to action this afternoon at home to Burnley as they chase their first win of the season. United were awful at Grimsby Town in midweek, and many will be expecting a response at home to a newly promoted side.",
      "And there are only a few days left for the Reds to strengthen their squad with transfer deadline day fast approaching. The window slams shut on Monday at 7pm UK time.",
      "Keep across our live blog throughout the day with all the latest from Old Trafford!",
      "BBC Sport’s Simon Stone reports that sources at Real Betis say the club have withdrawn their offer for Antony.",
      "The decision is reportedly due to financial constraints, with Betis unable to cover the transfer fee or the wages the player is set to receive.",
      "It remains to be seen how the situation will develop in the coming hours.",
      "Juan Sebastian Veron previously confessed he regrets his transfer from Manchester United to Chelsea as Alejandro Garnacho finalises a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "After weeks of negotiations, United have finally struck an agreement with Chelsea in a deal worth £40million. Blues head coach Enzo Maresca confirmed on Friday that Garnacho was at Cobham to undergo a medical and finalise his move.",
      "The winger is poised to become the club's seventh summer signing, excluding loaned-out players, and will compete with Pedro Neto and fellow newcomer Jamie Gittens for a spot on the flank, while striker Joao Pedro and Brazilian teenager Estevao Willian are also capable of playing out wide",
      "Read more here.",
      "The total deal is reportedly valued at over £43million, with United waiting for Hojlund to finalise personal terms with the Italian giants.",
      "Man United expect at least three players to leave before the transfer window closes on Monday night.",
      "United have agreed to sell Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea for £40million while loan moves for Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli and Antony to Real Betis are at an advanced stage. United have inserted a 10% sell-on clause in the deal for Garnacho, who will become the club's fourth-most expensive departure after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel di Maria. Garnacho is about to trump Scott McTominay as United's largest academy sale.",
      "Napoli initially proposed a straight loan move for Hojlund but United have insisted that an obligation to buy be included in the deal. Hojlund, 22, has been omitted from all three of United's squads so far this season.",
      "Antony is poised to return to Betis, where he spent the second half of last season on loan, in the absence of a willing buyer. Sancho identified Italy as his likeliest exit route and held discussions with Juventus before Roma expressed their interest.",
      "Garnacho, Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been training separately from the first team squad at United's Carrington training complex.",
      "Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini has admitted a move for Jadon Sancho is 'a possibility' ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.",
      "The MEN reported in June that Sancho was prepared to settle for a move to Italy, with Napoli one of the sides to be linked with the 25-year-old.",
      "When asked about Roma's interest in Sancho, head coach Gasperini told reporters (via Sky Italia): \"If you have the number, call him! You've written about everything and more. I don't know what the margins are, and you should never beg anyone.",
      "\"It's certainly a possibility, but it's also a huge opportunity for them. If you think like this, it becomes an advantage for everyone, otherwise not. If he understands it, it makes sense, otherwise he'll stay where he is.\"",
      "The winger has reportedly been given permission to travel to Spain, with discussions now to focus on Antony and Betis agreeing personal terms.",
      "Manchester United will resist letting Kobbie Mainoo leave before the transfer window closes on Monday night.",
      "Mainoo has indicated his wish to head out on loan before the 7pm deadline on September 1 but United sources say they cannot afford to lose him.",
      "Sources admit that United would move for a midfielder if they relent and let Mainoo join another club within the next 80 hours.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is regarded as a key squad player and head coach Ruben Amorim has the backing of the United leadership team over his handling of Mainoo.",
      "Read more here",
      "Following Wednesday night's shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town, pressure is naturally increasing on Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Yes, it's only August. Yes, the season is only three games old. Yes, United still have work to do in the transfer market. However, all of the positivity generated throughout pre-season is already a distant memory.",
      "With the first international break of the season almost upon us, there is already pressure on Amorim and United to deliver a result against Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Read more here",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly attracting interest from Napoli this summer.",
      "The Mirror claim that the Italian champions have a four-year contract waiting for the 20-year-old midfielder. And Mainoo has told United bosses he wants to go to Serie A - on a permanent deal.",
      "But United, mindful of the stunning impact made by another of their rejects, Scott McTominay, have so far blocked the move.",
      "Just three games into the season, the positivity has evaporated at Manchester United.",
      "United suffered a shock defeat to Grimsby Town on penalties in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday night, leading some fans to question Ruben Amorim's future at the club.",
      "After his appointment in November, Amorim oversaw a dismal 2024/2025 season. Shocking results were supposed to be behind Amorim, but United reached a new low against Grimsby.",
      "The inquest has begun and United will play Burnley in the Premier League this weekend before the international break begins. Amorim has just two days at Carrington to prepare for the game and we've taken a closer look at what United's head coach must do next to improve the situation.",
      "Read more here",
      "Fenerbahce have brutally sacked former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho.",
      "The Turkish club were beaten 1-0 by Benfica over two legs in the Champions League play-offs and will, therefore, play in the Europa League this season. Mourinho leaves Fenerbahce just two matches into the new season having being appointed in 2024.",
      "The self-titled 'Special One' arrived in Turkey after being sacked by Roma earlier in the same year. Mourinho was brought in to help win Fenerbahce's first league title since the 2013/14 season, with arch rivals Galatasaray largely dominating the trophy scene domestically.",
      "Manchester United players consider the humiliating League Cup defeat to Grimsby Town to be a new low and confidence is dwindling in their first and second-choice goalkeepers.",
      "Dressing room sources say the experienced contingent in the United squad regard the 2-2 draw with Grimsby and subsequent 12-11 penalty shootout defeat as their worst result.",
      "United lost 5-0 and 7-0 home and away to Liverpool in the past four years, while there have been seven 4-0 humblings since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, but the players acknowledge elimination by League Two Grimsby was a new nadir.",
      "Read more here",
      "An overwhelming percentage of Manchester United supporters believe the club is in desperate need of further additions ahead of the transfer window slamming shut on Monday evening.",
      "With just a handful of days to go until the window draws to a close, United have made four new signings thus far, bringing in Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Reds, who have made an underwhelming start to the season, had to prioritise attacking signings and the additions of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko are all statement signings.",
      "Read more here",
      "Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler is \"100%\" confident Carlos Baleba will stay at the club regardless of any hypothetically lucrative offers they may receive before the transfer deadline. \"If there is a number more than 100 [%], I would say more than 100, so fantastically confident,\" Hurzeler said.",
      "The Reds are understood to be among several suitors and interest is building in the former Lille man, who has three years left on his contract. Brighton, meanwhile, do not want to sell him until at least next summer, and he has taken the Premier League by storm since his £27million plus add-ons move in August 2023.",
      "Read more here",
      "United are reportedly not the only club holding talks over signing Lammens. The Telegraph claims personal terms negotiations have not been straightforward and adds that Galatasaray are exploring whether a deal can happen.",

      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have less than a week left to strengthen their squad before the summer transfer window closes at 7pm on Monday, September 1.",
      "It may be early days in the 2025/26 campaign, but all evidence so far suggests that the Reds still have plenty of work to do. That will surprise few after such a disastrous campaign last term, and yet the scale of United's rebuild often causes astonishment.",
      "The key areas that need filling are goalkeeper and a new central midfielder, with both positions exposed in the two Premier League matches Ruben Amorim's side have played so far. Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have both struggled over the last year or so, and there will be hope that Senne Lammens can step up if his move from Royal Antwerp is completed.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo are both being linked with a move away from Manchester United this summer.",
      "Reports emerged last weekend suggesting renewed interest in Fernandes from Saudi Arabia this summer. The Sun claim that Al-Ittihad are \"targeting\" the Reds' captain as the summer transfer window draws to a close.",
      "Elsewhere, a recent report from The Athletic suggests that Mainoo 'is open to leaving United' due to Reds boss Ruben Amorim favouring other midfield options. However, it is claimed that the England international's choices are limited before the transfer window closes on September 1 despite previous interest from Premier League rivals Chelsea.",

      "Welcome to our live Manchester United coverage this morning. Plenty of transfer news and rumours still surround Old Trafford.",
      "And the Reds head into Saturday's clash at home to Burnley desperate for a win after Wednesday's disastrous defeat to Grimsby and a winless start to the season. United only have a few days left to strengthen though with sales likely to be the priority.",

      "Jose Mourinho reportedly could inadvertently help facilitate former club Manchester United moving on from Andre Onana before the summer transfer window closes.",

      "Yann Sommer replaced the Cameroon international and remains their number one to start this term. Inter would reportedly move on from the 36-year-old should Onana return.",
      "Mourinho-coached Fenerbahce are said to be one club following the situation regarding Sommer. They reportedly want to sign a new goalkeeper.",
      "Having agreed a fee deemed suitable by Manchester United, further details on Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea have been revealed.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, he will be in London to undergo a medical on Friday and sign his seven-year contract.",
      "Once the deal goes through, he will become the club's fourth most expensive sale after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria.",

      "Manchester United made contact over the possibility of a summer transfer but were met by a resounding response from the Seagulls with a huge asking price also quoted. With a switch already appearing unlikely, Hurzeler has dashed all remaining hopes.",
      "Asked whether he was 100 per cent confident that Baleba would be staying put at Brighton this summer, head coach Hurzeler said in his press conference ahead of his side's clash with Manchester City: \"Yes.",
      "\"If there's a number more than 100, I would even say more than 100 so I'm confident.\"",
      "Chelsea have reached an agreement with Manchester United for the transfer of Alejandro Garnacho, it is being widely reported.",
      "Earlier this year, the Argentine winger was told by Ruben Amorim he could leave Old Trafford with a move to Stamford Bridge as his priority.",
      "Attempts to sign him were made in the January transfer window but those were rebuffed. However, Garnacho has been set on joining Chelsea with his wish now being granted.",
      "He will sign a seven-year contract with the Blues and will cost £40million as a fixed fee. United have also included a 10 per cent sell-on clause in the deal.",

      "Andre Onana's imminent future does not look set to impact a move for Senne Lammens with talks for him to join from Royal Antwerp resuming on Thursday.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, United want a new goalkeeper regardless of what happens with Onana.",

      "An update on Kobbie Mainoo's Manchester United future has been issued by journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "If Mainoo gets a concrete option and they bid about £33million, and Mainoo says to Manchester United in the next 48 hours or so, 'I want to go before September 1st,’ then my expectation is that Manchester United won't stand in his way.",

      "United may have lost to Arsenal on the opening weekend of the new Premier League season, but they showed great promise. Unfortunately for Ruben Amorim's side, it didn't count for much when they surrendered a one-goal lead to Fulham next up.",
      "Then, a few days later, Grimsby Town dumped the Reds out of the Carabao Cup second round, winning 12-11 on penalties. While United may fancy their chances against Burnley, Scott Parker will be eager to pile on the misery.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, he'll be without five players. Noussair Mazraoui and Lisandro Martinez remain unavailable for selection as they both look to rebuild their match fitness following spells on the sidelines.",
      "On Friday, the United head coach was asked for an update on his squad. Speaking to MUTV, Amorim said: \"Really well. I had some choices to make [for the weekend's side]. It was hard. I tried to choose the best starting XI, knowing that, sometimes, it's not the starting XI that is going to finish or close the game, so everyone is really important.\"",

      "The Portuguese has won eight of his 34 domestic matches in charge of United but the team have had a winless start to the season and do not have a cup tie now until the FA Cup third round in January.",

Mainoo has now appeared 73 times for United and Mainoo scored the winner in the 2024 FA Cup final against Manchester City before he started for England in the European Championship final later that year.",

      "A parting shot via email from Marcus Rashford's cousin, Lois, last month read, verbatim: \"get 4th round carabao, out to norwich in the p****n rain looooooooooll.\" Manchester United did not even get that far.",
      "There was biblical rain in Grimsby, another storm that has gathered overhead for Ruben Amorim. Amorim conducted his post-match press conference in a huddle on the pitch. He appeared to be agitating to get on it all night.",
      "When Amorim was about to start his first chat with Natalie Gedra, the Grimsby fans broke into another rendition of \"Sacked in the morning\". They had the courtesy to stop when Amorim started speaking.",
      "Amorim's equanimity was striking. He had gone through the ringer and was cowering in the dugout during the penalty shootout. They say a manager loosens up when he has entered the end game.",
      "Amorim is not there yet. He retains the backing of the United hierarchy, though that is always worthless. Omar Berrada assured us on September 1 last year that Erik ten Hag had \"full backing\". Ten Hag was sacked in October.",
      "There was no rendition of the Amorim chant from the 1,200 United supporters at Blundell Park. They were strikingly subdued at 0-0. One season-ticket holder of more than 30 years messaged: \"I feel like the countdown has begun.\" That was after the draw at Fulham.",
      "Amorim's body language has never been as defeatist as it was at fourth-tier Grimsby. His head dropped repeatedly, he had to stop himself from stepping onto the pitch and several players were berated. Amorim was on his haunches so frequently he might as well have been on his knees.",
      "After Bryan Mbeumo pinged the crossbar, the United players could not get off the pitch quickly enough. Harry Maguire pointed towards the tunnel and security personnel urgently ordered them in that direction.",
      "The mass pitch invasion spared them. Friends in the away end confirmed mutiny was simmering, with Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot the two whipping boys. Onana could not have been further away from them when the contest ended and it is just as well. He was booed.",
      "After the 90 minutes, Onana rushed down the tunnel, followed by the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital. The referee tossed the coin for the shootout with Onana still indoors.",
      "Altay Bayindir looked anxiously down the tunnel. Reading between the lines, Onana and Vital must have headed out of sight to do some last-minute analysis on Grimsby's penalty takers.",
      "The logical assumption is they were unprepared. Watching the shootout, it looked that way. Onana made one genuinely superb save yet gloved five other kicks that beat him. He dived the wrong way at least as many times. Where was the water bottle with guidance on which way Grimsby's players place their penalties?",
      "Bruno Fernandes had urged Onana to remain calm when he re-emerged yet he snapped after the first few kicks and vented at Bayindir. Fernandes was unhappy that Onana was not handing the ball to United's next taker to ensure their routine was uninterrupted.",
      "Fans may now wonder whether Bayindir, in goal for United's only shootout win since the start of last season, ought to have replaced Onana, a la Tim Krul. That would have crushed the Cameroonian's already fragile confidence into dust.",
      "Amorim cannot legislate for Onana being beaten at his near post and misreading a cross but he has to shoulder some responsibility. He has mismanaged the goalkeeper situation, starting Bayindir when Onana was available not once but twice, all while United are in discussions to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp and bristling at a question about Tom Heaton.",
      "He has also erred at the other end, where Benjamin Sesko has had a worse start to his United career than Rasmus Hojlund. United confirmed cramp meant Sesko was down as the tenth outfield penalty taker but it was still an odd look for a £73.66million striker.",
      "We would have doubtless seen a more bullish Sesko had he started against Arsenal on the opening weekend. He had been training with his new teammates for a week. By delaying a start, Sesko's confidence has subsided and his fitness is not as robust.",
      "Sesko was always going to be compared with other strikers involved in big-money transfers. Hugo Ekitike has three in three and Viktor Gyokeres two in two. Already it is three games and no goals for Sesko.",
      "United have unravelled through the manager mismanaging the two most important positions in the team and the absence of a single sale. That is about to change with Alejandro Garnacho, flogged on the cheap to Chelsea for £40m.",
      "In the United players' family section for the Europa League semi-final first leg at Athletic Bilbao, the only players whose agents were visible were Garnacho's and Kobbie Mainoo's. On the same day that United agreed to sell one, the other requested to leave.",
      "The continued presence of bomb squad members is undoubtedly affecting what else United can do to strengthen. Casemiro is bed-blocking a midfield reinforcement (and Mainoo), yet his probable stay was practically celebrated by tone-deaf members of club media last week.",
      "United could have easily shifted Bayindir, a £4.3m signing two years ago, early in the summer to make room for a new goalkeeper. Instead, they regarded a new goalkeeper as a non-priority and United's two main 'keepers have become worse.",
      "Amorim's bold calls with individuals used to be for the betterment of the club but it has been to United's detriment over the last month. Removing Hojlund from the squad, playing without a striker and then delaying Sesko's first start were costly. His choices in goal have caused indecision and directly led to three goals.",
      "We have seen it enough times from a press box to have an inkling when a manager has passed the point of no return. That already appears to be the case with Amorim. He is a good guy and a good coach but his record is indefensible",
      "For a manager to be considered a success at United, they have to win the title. When Amorim was hired, you could imagine him ending United's championship drought. Now? He's drowning in a downpour.",

      "Manchester United could leave themselves open to further transfer humiliation if they decide to sell Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho this weekend. And it may leave more openings for Erik ten Hag to be proved correct yet again, almost a year on from his Old Trafford exit.",
      "A pattern has emerged at United in recent years, whereby players who couldn't thrive for them have been loaned or sold only to impress elsewhere. Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa) and Antony (Real Betis) each enjoyed resurgences on loan at other clubs last season, while Anthony Elanga, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Alvaro Carreras have undergone similar transformations after being sold.",
      "But no example appears more wasteful than Scott McTominay, who was named Serie A Player of the Year after helping guide Napoli to the league title in his first season after leaving United. In that sense, one can envision how other teams could get a stronger tune out of obvious young talents like Mainoo and Garnacho if they were to leave this summer.",
      "Ten Hag made it clear at the time of McTominay's move to Naples last summer that it was not his decision: \"I am a little mixed. I am very happy for him but I would prefer not to lose him because he was so important for our team.",
      "\"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales. Obviously, homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It’s not the right thing to do, but for everyone, for all parts, it’s a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player, but also for us.\"",
      "Ten Hag, who gave Mainoo his first-team debut at United, poured praise upon the player in August 2024 when he hinted the youngster has what it takes to one day become a \"perfect midfielder.\" That was in reference to the player's ability to do well in all aspects of his midfield responsibilities.",
      "Once lauded as the greatest talent to come out of United's academy in some time, Mainoo suddenly finds himself on the fringes under Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old hasn't played a minute in the Premier League so far this term and has reportedly requested a loan away, though United are understood to have swiftly rejected the idea.",
      "And while Garnacho's stock at Old Trafford has sunk as the player appears set for a move to Chelsea, he too was once lauded by his old boss. It was only 12 months ago Ten Hag spared no expense in putting Garnacho on a pedestal as one of United's biggest gems.",
      "The Dutchman was asked last summer whether the South American could break into the elite category and responded: \"A world-class player? He has to go a long way. He has high potential.",
      "\"He showed last season he can contribute and be a starting XI player. To make the jump and become a world-class player, it starts with very hard work. That brought him to where he is now and that will bring him to being that world-class player. I agree he has the potential.\"",
      "Garnacho's demeanour is what appears to have landed him in Amorim's bad books ahead of what looks a likely move to west London. The Argentinian was made to train away from the squad in December 2024, around the same time he and his brother were implicated in a report suggesting someone within the squad was leaking team news.",
      "Over the past two seasons, captain Bruno Fernandes (34 goals) and striker Rasmus Hojlund (26) are the only United players to have outscored Garnacho (21). And for a team that's been lacking in the attacking department, it's easier to see why a rival would spot an opportunity in recruiting him.",
      "United were mocked by some fans for selling McTominay for less than £30million given what he went on to achieve so quickly in Italy. Mainoo may be kept around for the time being, but there's a real risk the £40m figure attached to 21-year-old Garnacho's name is a sign history could be set to repeat.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could be set for a Manchester United exit, with the Red Devils potentially losing a player Alejandro Garnacho once described as \"the best player in the squad.\"",
      "Whilst Garnacho's own future seems destined for elsewhere, with a switch to Chelsea looming, Mainoo could be set to join Serie A champions Napoli before Monday's transfer deadline as the midfielder pursues a move. Although the club are reluctant to sanction any move.",
      "The 20-year-old was previously regarded as a crucial element of United's long-term plans following his displays across the past two campaigns. The youngster accumulated a tally of spectacular strikes and secured his England bow just over 12 months ago.",
      "He also delivered a man of the match display in United's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City in 2024 after netting the decisive goal. It was following that encounter against City where Garnacho lavished his colleague with extraordinary acclaim.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, alongside Mainoo, Garnacho hailed the midfielder's pivotal role in securing the victory. \"Just incredible,\" Garnacho said of his team-mate.",
      "\"I always say, for me, he's the best player in the squad and he's the youngest. We are also very good friends so I am very happy for him\" When presenting the man of the match award to Mainoo, Garnacho added: \"My man, I love you.\"",
      "With a squad brimming with talent, it spoke volumes to Mainoo's ability, that at just 20, he was given such an accolade. The England midfielder’s club contract runs until 2027 at United but negotiations over an extension have stalled.",
      "The Mirror say the Italian champions have a four-year contract waiting for Mainoo, with the player having told United bosses he wants to go to Serie A, but on a permanent deal.",
      "However, United are understandably cautious, given the remarkable impact another former player, Scott McTominay, has had at Napoli, and have so far prevented Mainoo's transfer. They are believed to value him at £50million and are open to offers, however.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has only started 16 out of 44 games, and was benched for the second consecutive Premier League match this season when United drew 1-1 with Fulham on Sunday. Nonetheless, Mainoo played the full 90 minutes in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "A video of a disheartened Mainoo at the final whistle at Fulham circulated on social media, fuelling rumours of his potential exit ahead of Monday's deadline.",
      "Meanwhile, United have agreed a £40m deal with Chelsea for Garnacho, after he fell out of favour with Amorim. The Red Devils have secured a 10 per cent sell-on fee after United stood their ground on their valuation of Garnacho, having turned down Chelsea's initial offer of £25m.",
      "Garnacho was omitted from United's starting line-up for their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and publicly criticised Amorim in the immediate aftermath of the loss in Bilbao.",
      "If Mainoo moves to Napoli, he will be aiming to replicate the success of McTominay. The Scotsman was permitted to leave Old Trafford last summer for Antonio Conte's side in a £25m deal.",
      "Since then, he has delivered a series of man of the match performances domestically and in Europe, becoming the first Scot to be shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or since former Rangers striker Ally McCoist in 1987.",

      "Grimsby Town owner Jason Stockwood was left bewildered when a Manchester United official enquired about the location of Ruben Amorim's changing room at Blundell Park.",
      "Stockwood, 55, is still on cloud nine after his side completed one of the most stunning upsets in League Cup history by defeating the Red Devils on penalties. At first, it seemed the League Two outfit would suffer heartbreak after surrendering a commanding 2-0 advantage.",
      "Following Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren's exploitation of Andre Onana's poor goalkeeping during the opening period, Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire struck after the interval to restore parity. Nevertheless, an epic penalty shoot-out resulted in Grimsby prevailing 12-11, triggering wild celebrations at Blundell Park.",
      "Following the match, Stockwood disclosed an entertaining conversation he'd had with a United official, which emphasised the vast disparity between the two clubs' statures. Speaking to the Athletic, Stockwood said: \"I'll tell you one funny quick thing.",
      "\"With Manchester United coming to town, they sent us almost a rider for the manager, and it was like, 'Where's the manager's changing room?' And I was like, 'F***ing hell, the manager's changing room?' For us, it is the back of his car. The manager has a changing room at Man United? I thought that was quite amusing.\"",
      "Grimsby's stunning victory made them the first fourth-tier side in English football history to eliminate United from cup competition. It represented another dismal display from the Red Devils, who remain winless in the current season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "There had been initial encouragement following their spirited performance against Arsenal at Old Trafford, despite succumbing 1-0 to the north London outfit. A frustrating 1-1 stalemate at Fulham brought United back to earth, but the defeat to Grimsby has sent morale at Old Trafford plummeting.",
      "Having observed United's arrival, Stockwood remarked the Red Devils' players appeared ill-equipped for the wet and combative test awaiting them at Blundell Park. He added: \"They clearly didn't know what they were coming into.",
      "\"When the players came off the bus and onto the pitch, I stood around and the United players did not look like they were up for it. It was all the cliches.",
      "\"They have got all those incredible talents and I'm a massive fan of the Premier League. The individual talent on display last night was extraordinary.",
      "\"The team performance speaks for itself from United. But seeing them coming in, they did not look like they wanted to be there, which I really enjoyed!\"",
      "United encounter another awkward test at the weekend when they welcome Burnley to Old Trafford. The newly-promoted outfit are buoyant after defeating Sunderland in their most recent Premier League encounter, before overcoming Derby County 2-1 in the League Cup.",
      "Given the current atmosphere, both inside and outside of United, a match against Scott Parker's team could prove to be a tricky affair.",
      "With crucial fixtures against arch-rivals Manchester City and a home game against Chelsea on the horizon, United are in dire need of a win.",

      "Jones' decision marks another landmark in Biancheri's young career. The United ace, who has featured in both of the Reds' Under-21s opening two Premier League 2 outings this season, is deemed as one of the most exciting talents within the club's academy.",
      "However, he is eligible to play for both Wales and Canada at international level and spent time training with the latter's senior squad earlier in the summer.",
      "However, Jones is hopeful Biancheri will commit his international future to Wales, explaining: \"It's been a fascinating journey [for him]. He's come through the system with us.",
      "\"What we try to do with the younger age group players is encourage them to have those experiences when they're younger to help them make their decisions. We always feel fully confident of what we create in all age groups in terms of our environment and what it feels like, and should feel like, to represent our country.",
      "\"It was something he felt he needed to explore and all we could do was support him. The difficulty is that the scrutiny is a lot more in the older age groups.",
      "\"I've had two calls with him since he's returned that were positive. 'It just wasn't Wales' was quite a nice line for him to give us to know that we'd have the confidence to select him back into our environment, so we have brought him back in and he's itching to go.\"",
      "Biancheri, who scored 25 goals for United's Under-18s and Under-21s last season, could be allowed to leave Old Trafford on loan ahead of the transfer window closing on Monday evening.",

      "\"Don't let me hear that. Please man. I need you stay at the club, be patient.",

      "Garnacho's sale will also represent the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "Club sources believe they have negotiated a pragmatic deal for a player who has been pushing strongly to leave, following a deterioration in his relationship with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for the Manchester derby in December, but was reintegrated back into the squad, unlike Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Aston Villa in the January window.",
      "However, there were further discipline issues with Garnacho as the season progressed and the winger questioned Amorim's decision to name him on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "When speaking to journalists in the USA this summer, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho. He responded: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",

      "United completed the signing of Garnacho on a free transfer from Atletico Madrid in September 2020 and after progressing in the academy and winning the FA Youth Cup, the youngster became an established part of the first-team squad.",

      "Following a 2-2 stalemate at the end of 90 minutes, United exited the competition following a 12-11 defeat on penalties. Bryan Mbeumo, who stepped up to take his second effort of the shootout, missed the decisive penalty, striking the crossbar.",
      "As a result, United have no choice but to focus on the Premier League until they enter the FA Cup at the third round stage in January.",
      "The Reds have no European football to look forward to this season after last term's struggles, meaning they will have to seriously improve their success rate against their domestic rivals if they are to make this season a success.",
      "Since replacing Erik ten Hag last November, Amorim has overseen just eight domestic victories in 34 matches across the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup. The FA Cup victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in January was decided on penalties following a 1-1 draw, and Law 10.2 in the Laws of the Game states that penalty shootouts are separate from the scoreline at the end of 'normal' time.",
      "As a result, Amorim's tally of domestic victories as United boss stands at just eight, of which seven have been achieved in the Premier League.",
      "Since taking charge of United for the first time against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on November 24 last year, United have amassed just 28 points from a possible 87.",
      "You cannot overlook the fact Amorim inherited a difficult situation last season and tried to completely overhaul United's style of play, but this is a club that prides itself on victories and trophies. Wednesday night's events at Blundell Park served as a stark reminder that they are light years away from where they aspire to be.",
      "Although the season is only three games old, United's failure to get a win on the board thus far is only increasing pressure on Amorim. Is he solely to blame for the current situation? Of course not.",
      "Nevertheless, he is the head coach and was brought to Old Trafford to deliver results. Nine months into his tenure and victories have been few and far between.",
      "Despite highlighting the negatives, I believe Amorim should be given longer to translate his plans to the pitch and be given the chance to bed in his new signings in the hope of a turnaround, given we are just three games into a new season after a £215million summer spend.",
      "United are already onto their sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, meaning another change in the dugout isn't guaranteed to make any difference.",
      "However, consideration to Amorim's future might become inevitable in the coming weeks and months if the situation fails to improve. Eight wins in 34 matches is simply unacceptable.",

      "Ruben Amorim’s Man United nightmare stooped to new lows in midweek, as his side lost to fourth tier Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, and they will be seeking a response when they host Burnley on Saturday.",
      "The Red Devils bounced back from 2-0 down to go to penalties, but misses from Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha cost them dearly and they lost the shootout.",
      "Now they have the opportunity to bounce back from that humiliation with a Premier League clash with newly promoted Burnley.",
      "The pressure will be on in front of their home crowd and the atmosphere will be tense, it feels like a must win for Amorim even this early in the season.",
      "We’re yet to see the best of the trio of Cunha, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but if they click they could be a match made in heaven.",
      "They come up against Burnley, Scott Parker’s side had a tough start to life back in the top flight with a 3-0 defeat at Tottenham, but they bounced back with a 2-0 win over fellow promoted team Sunderland.",
      "There was a lot of noise about how competitive the promoted sides could be after all of them going down in the last two seasons, but they’ve all notched up a win in their first two games.",
      "Parker’s Burnley are a solid unit and their defensive reputation precedes them and on current form, Man United could struggle to break them down.",
      "It’ll certainly be interesting to see how Man United perform after the embarrassment at Grimsby and you’ll be able to follow it on our new live score centre.",
      "In terms of injuries, there aren’t too many concerns for Amorim, with Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui the only absentees.",
      "We imagine that Sesko will be given his first Premier League start, after United scored just once in their opening two games.",
      "It’s likely that Altay Bayindir will return to the side in favour of Andre Onana.",
      "Scott Parker’s team have a few absentees, with Manuel Benson, Zeki Amdouni, Connor Roberts and Jordan Beyer all ruled out with injury.",
      "Martin Dubravka is likely to return in goal after Max Weiss replaced him for the 2-1 win against Derby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Former Man City man Kyle Walker is set to start, while Bashir Humpheys could return at the heart of defence.",
      "Due to this game being a Saturday 3pm kick-off, it will not be televised live in the UK. However, there will be live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live.",
      "Man United are unbeaten in seven games against Burnley.",
      "Burnley’s last victory against the Red Devils came in 2020, when they won 2-0 at Old Trafford, which is their only victory at Old Trafford in the Premier League era.",
      "The pair drew 1-1 in their last clash, with Antony and Amdouni the goalscorers.",
      "On reaction to Grimsby defeat “Every time when we have a defeat like that, I am like that. Sometimes I hate my players sometimes I love them, sometimes I want to defend them. This is my way of doing things. I was so frustrated and annoyed. I know there are a lot of experienced people talking about how I should be with the media. To be more calm. I’m not going to be like that. I am going to be who I am. At that moment I was very disappointed. We had a good pre-season. We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And a bad game against Grimsby. Now it is a new game and I am focused on that.”",
      "On Kobbie Mainoo “He needs to fight for his place and we need Kobbie. That is not going to change. I understand players not playing are disappointed but everyone will have the same opportunity to play and must fight.”",
      "On talks during international break “I always have conversation with them I am just focused on this game. I have to live this day by day. If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that is good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin. So I understand that. And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It’s going to be hard. But now I’m good with the next one.”",
      "On Manchester United: “We are playing against an exceptional and a historic football club. They have some top quality players, who can change games at any moment. We are under no illusions of the task we have ahead of us.”",
      "On the atmosphere:  “Of course it’s a tough arena, a 70,000 crowd and the stadium itself, along with the magnitude of what Manchester United and Old Trafford is.”",
      "On transfers:  “A lot of boxes need to be ticked for us to go into the window. There will be some players who will leave and getting that game time is essential for them.”",
      "Sam Barrott will be the referee for this Premier League clash.",
      "Barrott has refereed 39 Premier League games, issuing 159 yellow cards and two reds.",
      "He’s taken charge of four Clarets’ games across his career and they’ve lost three of those four (1 W).",
      "He’s also refereed the Red Devils twice, with one win and one defeat coming from those matches.",
      "It’ll be a tense atmosphere at the Theatre of Dreams on Saturday and we think that could transfer into a tight contest out on the pitch.",
      "That’s usually the pattern for this fixture, with only two of the last nine games producing more than three goals, so under 2.5 goals is worth a punt.",
      "Despite their recent troubles, United should still have enough to beat Burnley and them to win by a one goal margin looks to present good value."

      "Enzo Maresca has confirmed Chelsea will be without Cole Palmer for Saturday’s west London derby against Fulham, while also acknowledging the imminent arrival of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Palmer was named in the starting XI for last week’s emphatic 5-1 win at West Ham but pulled out during the warm-up and watched from the sidelines.",
      "He was not included in the England squad named by Thomas Tuchel on Friday, and Maresca explained why he will not be available at Stamford Bridge.",
      "“Cole is out,” the Chelsea boss said. “Also, Benoit is out, and Romeo is out. The rest are all okay. Cole we need to see day by day, and the other two I don’t think are going to be back after the international break. But they are going to be closer.”",
      "Asked about Palmer being omitted by England, Maresca added: “I spoke with Thomas a few times, but in the end it’s Thomas’ decision and he decided that. He is not available tomorrow, so it shows that he has a problem.”",
      "Maresca admitted his side is weaker without Palmer but stressed the need to adapt, as they did against West Ham.",
      "“For sure, 100 per cent, we are a much better team with Cole, no doubt,” he said. “But when Cole is not in the game, we need to find different solutions. Last week we found different solutions, and hopefully tomorrow we can again find different solutions.”",

      "Estevao Willian started in Palmer’s place at the London Stadium, joining an attack that also featured Joao Pedro and Liam Delap for the first time. Maresca suggested similar changes will be required against Fulham as he manages a growing injury list.",
      "Romeo Lavia and Benoit Badiashile will also remain sidelined. “With Romeo and Benoit, it’s normal after a long time out that they will need time and sessions,” Maresca explained.",
      "“It’s the same with what we are doing with Wes [Fofana]. Wes is back and the other day he played some minutes. Hopefully, we can have more minutes and get him to the right condition.”",
      "On Lavia’s progress, he continued: “Two years ago he didn’t play any games. Last year he played some games, this season the target is to give him more games.",
      "“Hopefully, the moment he is back, he can be fit for a long time and play more minutes and games, because he is a player we really trust.”",
      "There was also a word on Chelsea’s incoming business, with Alejandro Garnacho now close to signing from Manchester United.",
      "“I know Garnacho is around here,” Maresca said. “It’s quite clear his position is a winger, and I see him as a winger.”",
      "Maresca left the door open to further changes before the window closes. “You can expect anything with the transfer window open – anything can happen in and out,” he said.",

      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",

The decision has been made and it’s only for a LOAN move, not for permanent exit. Kobbie wants to play regular football, he doesn’t want to leave #MUFC on permanent deal.’",

I’ve read a few comparisons between me and him and this kid. Don’t waste your time. He is 10 times the player I was at 19.’",

      "To which Ferdinand replied: “I think he’s more of a Seedorf player, that’s what I think. I think his style of football is more Seedorf.”",
      "Ferdinand added: “But Scholes saying he is 10 times the player he was, and I think you’ve got to remember that telling number there at 19. At 19.",
      "“That’s what he’s saying, Scholesy wasn’t developed yet, still had fantastic potential, but Scholes had asthma, he couldn’t finish games properly at a young age and stuff. He wasn’t nowhere near the player he became at 19.",
      "“At 19, this kid is playing in European championships, do you know what I mean? It’s not like he’s a kid who was there and you’re going, ‘Oh, he’s just in the youth team, just got out of the youth team or the under-21s.’",
      "“He was playing for England, starting for England. Scholesy at 19 wasn’t doing that. So that’s where he’s talking about the comparison. But listen, I’m a massive fan of Kobbie.”",

      "“And we’ve all had these moments in our careers where you’re like, ‘S*** man, I’m not playing. What do I do?’ Well, the first thing you do is go to the manager and go, ‘What am I not doing that I need to be doing to get in this team?’ Right. He’s going to tell me. Then I go to work on a training pitch.",
      "“Every day I go to work. I play up against whoever, Bruno [Fernandes] etc, and I start dominating them. Just that’s the type of mentality and mindset he has to go with. And then when the chance comes to play, take it with both hands.",

Whether it was Graham Taylor and Swedes/Turnips, whether it was JT being JT under Capello, whether it was Roy wondering why he was having to do a press conference – the whole non-relationships between players from rival clubs, toxic interactions with the media, perceived team underperformance and a frustrated fan base – difficult times.",
      "So at some point, whether by luck or by design, a decent, honest man of integrity was appointed and over time, club animosities were put to one side, a likeable group of players emerged, relationships with the media seemed to improve, players seemed to want to play for their country again and lo and behold, moderate success was achieved.",
      "Of course, the level achieved feel short of what some felt was possible – but you’ll always have that when you don’t ultimately win.",
      "Back to Utd and Sir Jim might have had his one and only correct idea when he, supposedly, wanted Sir Gareth of Southdate appointed.",
      "The isolating of players would have ended, honest post-match appraisals would have replaced the absolute bs cryptic post-match comments from the current occupant, decency and integrity would be the order of the day, calmness would ensue, the weight of the jersey would be lifted, the joy of playing would return and lo and behold, moderate success, maybe even great success, would be possible again.",
      "I say all this while being aware of the reaction emails and comments from the Utd fanbase over many years and realising that there might be too many of the, “Hated, Adored, Never Ignored” contingent who do not really long for stability, calm and slow forward progress in their club.",
      "They remind me of that toxic gf ( or bf ) who seems to mostly want the chaos and the drama. Being thought of as irrelevant is their greatest fear so even the shocking results that guarantee headlines is still preferable than no attention at all.",
      "Those supporters, sorry fans, need to break this abusive co-dependant relationship and strive for something that’s actually healthy and which will work out better in the medium to long term.",

But despite all the warning signs, how can they possibly sack a manager who hasn’t been at the club a year, has only had one pre-season and one truly productive transfer window? A transfer window where a club that the part-owner wants us to believe is under huge financial pressure just spent £200m buying players to fit into the new manager’s plans.",

      "United have only had three successful (ie title winning) managers in their 147 year (including the Newton Heath years) history, which means for the vast majority of their existence, they have been a very ordinary football team. Liverpool have had ten, in comparison.",
      "Manchester United do not deserve their place at the top table, and have no right to success, and despite ignominy after ignominy, most of their fans still don’t get it. Gary Neville tipped them to come fourth this season, for crying out loud. What is that, if it isn’t blind entitlement?",
      "I saw Badwolf – the leader of the Amorim-out brigade – declaring the other day that sacking David Moyes was the right decision, and this just shows that even with hindsight and history, he can’t see the wood for the trees. United’s entire fall from grace was fueled by sacking Moyes, and since then it has been one poor and rushed appointment after another. Moyes was sacked because of the entitlement of the club, because he didn’t oversee a seamless transition (with an ageing, disjointed squad, far too reliant on players in their twilight years) after the most successful manager in English football history. He wasn’t backed in the transfer market (Fellaini in the summer and Mata in January), and was given no period of grace at all.",
      "And why? Because Man Utd think that they should always be winning trophies, and when they are not, they get rid of the latest plan A, even though they don’t have a plan B. And now the fans want it to happen again.",
      "How do you think this is going to work out, fellas?",
      "United have to stand by Amorim, even though he looks certain to fail, because getting someone in – Southgate would be the best and the highlight of his club managerial career was to not get Middlesbrough relegated for two whole seasons – is not going to fix the problem. They might shore things up and get a top ten place. And then what? Keep them on, like they did Solksjaer, and hope for some progress?",
      "United are so far off the pace from every reasonable metric. The squad. The manager. The stadium. The owners. And the fans, who have forgotten that supporting the club is a part of the job description. And these same fans scream entitlement every time they speak. Well, the ones who frequent this website, anyway.",

You’ll work at a massive club which will raise your profile, but simultaneously a club which is on life support in every way but financially (despite what earthworm Jim claims as he cuts sandwiches from low paid staff) which means when you fail (and you will) you get to blame the club instead of yourself.",
      "And because everyone hates the owners of the club, they’ll accept it’s the club and not you.",
      "You’ll work for two years and then sail off into the sunset with a bag of cash so big they’ll still be paying you four years after being fired.",
      "That was an extremely pessimistic view, and yet amorim is trying to speed run even my pessimistic timeline.",
      "It’s still early season but so far the only signing which seems to be a good one is Cunha. Sesko looks as unconvincing as he did in Germany and if you believe in stats then you’ll already know mbuemo was having a one off season last year and punching well above his weight. I think he’s a good player but I can’t see him moving the needle at United really. Time will tell.",
      "It’s tempting and customary to blame Obama for everything and he was at fault for the second goal but the first one is squarely on whoever vacated the entire of United’s right hand defensive side and allowed Grimsby a totally unchallenged free shot – thats exactly the kind of the thing that national news and social media used to flame Trent for doing all the time.  That’s a coaching issue because it’s been happening in every game , it’s just the first time United got punished for it.",
      "I know United fans don’t want to hear it, and it’s not the first time I’ve said it, but a relegation would actually be a good thing for the club. It would force you to sell the overpaid underperforming players who drift around the club. It would take you out of the limelight for at least a year, crucially it would massively lower expectations at every level and bring the temperature down a lot. It would be like a cleansing fire.",
      "The fact this exact same process happens to every manager and the fact that almost every former United players performs way better once they’re out the club tells you the problem IS United. It’s not the players per se. Its not the managers either. It’s not even the owners because…they keep spending money and united are still shit. The Human criticism shield that is earthworm Jim and his ludicrous cuts to all the lowest paid staff didn’t help, nor did dropping a a couple of hundred million.",

      "",
      "Well that’s a new one and the funny thing is that I’m not even upset about the result because this has been coming for a while and shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. The humour on Subreddits and instagram were objectively hilarious and I’m going to avoid the obvious points of Amorim Out, Onana has fewer football IQ points than hands etc",
      "I think what we’re seeing here is the result of Late Capitalism and aggressive private equity tactics and how it affects businesses. Yes other businesses have bought other clubs and they’re doing well but has any other club been lumped with huge debts like United got from the Glazers’ leveraged buyout garbage. I have no idea how it’s been legal but this is classic PE and the Glazers can enjoy their time milking the club for as much as they can until it’s gone. Their priority is financial returns at the end of the year and paying off their debts; they don’t care about reinvesting into the club. They don’t care what happens to United because even if, god forbid, the club does fold into bankruptcy under the weight of their avarice they can use the failure/loss as a tax cut on their other assets.",
      "This is why they only care about short term investment. Buying players isn’t a good long term investment and even then they buy poorly just to be able to sell the idea of progress. A boring but reliable Defensive mid? Nope two strikers who won’t get service. Reinvest into stadium infrastructure and youth facilities? Nope let’s push the idea of a flash new stadium when we’re playing in the Championship. Build a club ethic and use our money more efficiently? Nope let’s cut jobs, employee benefits and mess around with season ticket holders (Sir Jim is a massive neoliberal twat and has no idea what he’s doing)",
      "And that’s the root of the issue – It’s all board room guff. It’s financial smoke and mirrors. We’re seeing in real time the long term effects of short term, capitalist thinking. This is what happens when you don’t plan long term and keep thinking flashy short term solutions will fix the cracks. This is what happens when it’s money over people and greed over soul. This issue is bigger than Amorim and until the Glazers return to their special circle of hell we will continue to see United circle the drain.",

      "But that’s not the only classic refrain they’ve dusted off. Since Sir Alex “Wakey-wakey, meat-and-two-veg decisive masterclass” Ferguson retired, Man Utd’s strategy always seems to be: “Let’s rely on a player the fans don’t exactly adore to drag us out of the mire.” Cue the parade: Fellaini, McTominay, Maguire, pick your scapegoat-of-the-week, the one the fans quietly mutter about while cleaning out their earwax. It’s become as predictable as Arsenal opponents moaning about VAR.",
      "Last night, Grimsby marched into Blundell Park, said “Thanks for the memories?” to United, and then, just to twist the knife, sent them home in a 12–11 penalty shootout after a 2–2 draw. If that doesn’t justify a big, fat “told-you-so” from my girlfriend’s clan, I don’t know what does.",
      "So, dear reader: I just wanted to highlight how surreal this throwback result was, peppered with the usual United tropes post-Fergie.

Chelsea finished September in 8th place, with a record of 3W 1D 2L.

What’s certain is there’ll be no change in formation on Saturday, despite his beloved 3-4-2-1 looking utterly unworkable. Tactical tweaks and, crucially, signs of adaptability are essential. Without them, he’s not going to last.",
      "Burnley are beatable, of course, but they’re the definition of awkward. They’ll make it ugly, and there’s a very real chance Scott Parker wins the tactical battle against Amorim. Bleak.",
      "",
      "There’s plenty of intrigue around players this weekend — from Eze, Florian Wirtz and Konate in Liverpool v Arsenal to the underperformers in Amorim’s Manchester United squad. But the biggest question mark may come at Elland Road, where Anthony Gordon’s suspension opens the door for William Osula to lead the line for Newcastle against Leeds United.",
      "Whether Eddie Howe actually trusts him is another matter. Reports suggest Osula could even leave the club, leaving Newcastle strikerless – albeit with a seventh-choice £73m striker coming soon – and Howe has done little to dispel that notion. Still, his late goal in Monday’s dramatic 3-2 defeat to Liverpool should be enough to earn him a start, or at the very least, more minutes off the bench.",
      "Once he’s on the pitch, Osula has to seize the moment. Few believe he’s the long-term answer to Newcastle’s striker problem, but he can change perceptions. His instinctive finish under Alisson almost salvaged a point against Liverpool, and if the 22-year-old can help inspire Newcastle to their first win of the season, who knows what doors might open?",
      "Leeds are reeling after conceding five at Arsenal and crashing out of the Carabao Cup to Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday. With Gordon suspended and Joelinton and Sandro Tonali both likely sidelined, someone has to step up; this is Osula’s chance to stake a serious claim.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola’s rotation roulette makes Man City an unpredictable team every week, and it will be interesting to see how he reacts to a poor performance and result at home to Tottenham Hotspur. Led by new signing Tijjani Reijnders, his team played Wolves off the park on matchday one, yet there were changes for the visit of Thomas Frank’s side. Rayan Cherki and Omar Marmoush came in for Bernardo Silva and Jeremy Doku, and we can easily see the former coming back into the starting XI for Brighton away on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Brighton away is a very tricky fixture, especially considering City lost at the Amex last season. Their record against the Seagulls is mostly excellent, but 2024/25 was not the City we know, losing away and drawing at home against Sunday’s opponents.",
      "Reijnders is one of the only guaranteed starters in this City team, and he has a formidable midfield opponent in Man United-linked Carlos Baleba. Having took the p*ss out of Joao Gomes and Andre, his quality should shine through. Other than him, it’s difficult to predict who starts. Even Erling Haaland isn’t safe as Guardiola searches for a new recipe for success. And then you have James Trafford or Ederson, the defensive options, Rayan Ait-Nouri’s fitness, and if Rodri will come in for Nico Gonzalez.",
      "This should be an entertaining game between two attacking teams, and another match in which we should learn plenty about this new-look, more youthful Cityzens team.",
      "",
      "Manager pressure is becoming a theme of this Big Weekend, with new Sheffield United boss Ruben Selles enduring a nightmare start, while new Middlesbrough manager Rob Edwards has achieved perfection with three wins from three.",
      "The Blades sit bottom of the table. Yes, it’s still early days, but after racking up 90 points last season and falling just short in the play-off final, their position is alarming. Three defeats on the spin have piled the pressure on Chris Wilder’s replacement— a very different story to Edwards.",
      "For the former Luton Town boss, this feels like a chance to reset his reputation after the way things unraveled at Kenilworth Road. Taking over from Michael Carrick at the Riverside gives him a platform, and Boro are a club with Premier League ambitions. Beating a side expected to bounce back into the promotion race would make a statement. For Sheffield United, it’s equally an opportunity to stop the bleeding and be a catalyst for recovery.",
      "History doesn’t favour Selles. Middlesbrough are unbeaten in their last nine meetings with the Blades. This could be brutal.",
      "",
      "The first of presumably 16 Glasgow Derbies/Old Firms this season arrives in an embarrassing week for Scotland’s two biggest clubs.",
      "Celtic crashed out of the Champions League play-offs in historically grim fashion, losing on penalties to Kazakh side FC Kairat — statistically the second-worst exit in the competition’s history. Opta Power Rankings place Kairat as the 473rd-best team in the world, sandwiched between Luton and Wycombe Wanderers. Even Linfield sit higher in UEFA’s coefficient table. It’s not quite Progres Niederkorn and Pedro Caixinha arguing in bushes, but it’s still really, really bad.",
      "Brendan Rodgers’ side failed to score across 210 minutes, though they may not feel quite as crushed as their rivals come Sunday.",
      "Rangers somehow managed to go lower. Already trailing 3-1 on aggregate heading to Belgium, they produced one of the most humiliating nights in their history: a 6-0 thrashing by Club Brugge, sealing a 9-1 aggregate defeat. Any hope of a miracle ended quickly — 1-0 down after five minutes, then down to 10 men three minutes later. Max Aarons, formerly of Bournemouth and Norwich, inexplicably hauled down Christos Tzolis 40 yards from goal, earning one of the most obvious red cards you’ll ever see. From there, it was carnage: five down at half-time, with Brugge showing mercy after Tzolis’ strike made it six in the 50th minute.",
      "Those midweek calamities set up a fascinating derby at Ibrox. As always, regardless of form, it will be fought with every fibre of hatred the two clubs have for each other.",
      "Russell Martin now faces more pressure than even Amorim at Manchester United. After the Brugge debacle and three draws from three Premiership games, his position is hanging by a thread. There’s no better fixture to win the fans back, but another defeat could spell the end before September. Sack him now, and there’s still a season to salvage. Wait until December, and it’s already gone.",

      "A little over three months after Ruben Amorim told Alejandro Garnacho to find a new club in front of his teammates, the 21-year-old is on his way to Chelsea for £40m. Any chance you’ve backed the wrong horse, lads?",
      "It’s a transfer which we’re now in danger of seeing as a Manchester United win but should unquestionably be viewed as a huge missed opportunity for the Red Devils and yet another significant blot on the copybook of their under pressure manager. Just imagine how this move would have been viewed when Amorim first arrived in November.",
      "Negotiations with Chelsea have been fruitful for United. They quoted £50m for their academy graduate, Chelsea came in at £25m, and BlueCo have ended up paying a £40m fixed fee, with the deal also including a 10 per cent sell-on clause which could prove very worthwhile for United should Chelsea continue to treat the transfer market like a car boot sale.",
      "Quite staggeringly, as well as the sale marking the largest for a United academy graduate, it’s also the fourth largest in United’s history after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria. It still feels significantly lower than his value.",
      "Chelsea will require no marked improvement – or any at all – on what Garnacho achieved last season, with ten goals and ten assists in all competitions, to make a profit on him next summer should the Stamford Bridge saloon doors continue to swing unencumbered. Anthony Elanga got 18 goal contributions before Newcastle bought him for £52m. Chelsea sold Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £48m after just 15.",
      "And that’s what Garnacho produced under a manager who never fancied him. His 58 appearances for United were a product of long-term absences for Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad Diallo, while Marcus Rashford and Antony leaving on loan in January left Amorim very little option but to play Garnacho. He found a way in the Europa League final though.",
      "That was the final straw for Garnacho, who called out their “sh*t season” after playing just 19 minutes of the defeat to Tottenham having started every knockout game to help United get there. He then ensured bridges were burned entirely by wearing Rashford’s Aston Villa shirt over the summer and insisting he would rather not play football this season at all than work under Amorim again.",

      "It’s easy to suggest United are better off without his petulance, and many fans over the summer will no doubt have seen their manager’s call to rid the club of a ‘bad apple’ as a good one. But we wonder if, amid the backdrop of a new nadir for Amorim in the form of defeat to League Two Grimsby Town to prompt calls for his sacking, whether United fans able to pause and reflect on their manager’s awful reign at Old Trafford are now thinking about the damage he’s done to their football club.",
      "United named Garnacho as one of three ‘untouchable’ players shortly before he arrived, one of the great hopes of the future along with Rasmus Hojlund, who’s now also on his way out of the club, and Kobbie Mainoo, who wants out, with any hope that he won’t leave resting on the Amorim sack preceding the next transfer window. Would Marcus Rashford currently be playing for Barcelona had any other manager replace Erik ten Hag? Doubt it.",
      "Were Manchester United considered better off with the quality we had seen from Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo when Amorim first arrived, along with their high ceilings for improvement, or now with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko? It’s at best a toss up and it’s certainly not the £100m+ upgrade the net spend will suggest it is when all is said and done.",
      "Garnacho’s departure will be tinged with sadness and regret for many, given his goal in the FA Cup final win over Manchester City in 2024, his masterful overhead kick at Goodison Park and plenty of other off-your-seat moments besides in what was an all-too brief time at Old Trafford for a player tipped for the very top almost from the very first time he stepped onto the pitch.",
      "And while his infantile actions may also leave some with a sense of relief at him now being Chelsea’s problem, there’s at least as good a chance he will fly as flop at Stamford Bridge, which will leave Manchester United fans wondering whether they backed the right horse in Amorim, who looks set to be taken out back anyway, after he’s turned Garnacho and his fellow Red Devil untouchables into pariahs in the space of eight months.",

      "By Danyal Khan - @danyalhkhan",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 19:27, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",

      "Image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo celebrating in February 2024 went viral but 16 months on all three could be heading for the Manchester United exit door; what went wrong for promising young trio and who is to blame for their failure to fire for Ruben Amorim?",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 13:32, UK",
      "Instantly iconic. But now, for the wrong reasons.",
      "The image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration in February 2024, appeared to showcase Man Utd's bright future.",
      "A year-and-a-half on, Hojlund and Garnacho look set to leave before the end of this transfer window, Mainoo is out of the first-team frame in the Premier League, while the club lurches into another crisis.",
      "How did it come to this? And who is to blame?",
      "Hojlund, then aged 21, had opened the scoring against West Ham. Alejandro Garnacho, just 19, struck two more. Kobbie Mainoo, the 18-year-old academy starlet, would go on to start a Euros final for England a few months later.",
      "Their combined celebration for Garnacho's first goal was a cheeky dig back at West Ham's Mohammed Kudus, who had marked his goal in the reverse fixture a couple of months earlier in similar fashion.",
      "But it came to stand for more than that. This was a snapshot of hope, an image to believe better times were ahead.",
      "Hojlund was in the hot streak of his Man Utd career, in the midst of a run which saw him bag seven goals in six games.",
      "Garnacho recorded his best figures for goal involvements that season, scoring seven in the Premier League - including that Puskás winner at Everton - and the opener in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Mainoo also netted at Wembley, seemingly confirming his rise would inevitably take him to the top.",
      "Sitting down with then-United boss Erik ten Hag in the days after the Old Trafford photo was taken, the Dutchman sounded a warning to the trio.",
      "But unquestionably the feeling at that point was optimism. \"We have some exciting players,\" said Ten Hag, when he was asked about the celebration. There was a smile from a manager who is typically more interested in tactical talk than emotions.",
      "He could see the importance of the symbolism and also what it meant to Man Utd supporters.",
      "After all, this is a club which prides itself on its history of developing and honing young talents.",
      "Yet, fast forward to the final days of this summer's transfer window and Hojlund is off to Napoli, Garnacho to Chelsea and Mainoo - that prized, homegrown asset - can't get in the first team, has requested a loan and is expected to be the subject of offers from elsewhere.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho, in particular, feel victims of circumstance - and Ruben Amorim's fixation on 3-4-3.",
      "The Englishman isn't trusted in the central midfield two - despite playing a similar role alongside Declan Rice at the Euros. Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte are favoured there.",
      "He got a runout in the disastrous defeat to Grimsby but it is clear Amorim isn't convinced he has the attributes for the position.",
      "A short-lived experiment to play Mainoo off the striker seems over too, with United spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With Fernandes also deployed in that more advanced role, Mainoo, again, could count him fourth-choice in another position.",
      "Garnacho, meanwhile, finds himself a winger for a team which no longer uses them - and a wing-back role never looked like a conversion to maximise his talents.",
      "There have been strops at substitutions and friction off the field but attitude is not a core reason for his exit.",
      "For Hojlund, too many misses have ultimately been his undoing, with Benjamin Sesko now signed to lead the line. However, he could justifiably point to a far from fully-functioning attack around him.",
      "And there should also be sympathy for a young forward who was never intended to carry the weight of being United's lead striker, having arrived in a summer when they intended to also go for Harry Kane.",
      "Interestingly, Hojlund had more goals than Kane when he turned 22 but United want to move on.",
      "It is not hard to imagine this trio following Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Antony in rejuvenating their careers away from Old Trafford.",
      "They are all talented and will surely enjoy good times again. And that will raise more questions about the environment and culture at United - and perhaps, down the line, regrets.",
      "Where, for instance, will Mainoo be in a couple of years time, when Fernandes, Casemiro and Ugarte will likely have departed?",
      "Would Amorim's successor - whether he arrives sooner or later - not wish to have a winger with Garnacho's threat?",
      "The pair could be jettisoned in favour of the ideas of a head coach with the worst Man Utd managerial record in the modern era.",
      "It has been the story of United since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement: veering from one direction to another with little thought of the long-term plan.",
      "Hojlund, Garnacho and Mainoo looked set to be the future when they were pictured together on that promising day at Old Trafford. Just 16 months on they are out of the frame.",

      "Half of them turned up thinking: 'I'm only playing because it's Grimsby. I won't be playing against Burnley on Saturday'. Instead of: 'When I walk off that game, those Grimsby fans and players will go: I didn't know he was that good.' That's not the case.",
      "The attitude stinks from half of them. Back in the day, there were shocks, the pitches were a joke. That pitch was immaculate and they should go out and destroy Grimsby.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't get to the top by just his talent. And if he has to work hard as one of the greatest players of all-time, why can't the Manchester United players? It's arrogance.",
      "Who can knock on the door this weekend and go: why am I not playing? And they all want to leave! Where are they going to go? Who's going to take them?",
      "When he said: my players talk really loud - that means he has seen enough to know that they're not really playing for him, in my opinion.",
      "Then he turned around and said 'I can't change all 22 players', [meaning] 'it will have to be me to leave'.",
      "I was a manager at Walsall. You just know, and you get a feeling, when things aren't right.",
      "When Amorim came in everybody knew he could play three at the back. Everybody knew. Man Utd knew. The owners knew.",
      "He got that job by going the way he played. They never had the players to play that way - ever.",
      "I could have seen him go in at Chelsea with Malo Gusto, Reece James - attacking wing-backs who can make things happen and cross the ball. They're up and down. Chelsea have three centre-backs who would have suited the way he played.",
      "They got the wrong man for the players they had. He had to change the whole lot. They're not going to do that and he's not going to change his system for Man Utd.",
      "He came in from Portugal to one of the biggest jobs in world football playing the way he played. Why would he change?",
      "He didn't want to come in during the middle of the season because he knew they were not his players. No wing-backs. Then he had to come in, it was a mad struggle and this season he hasn't got it.",
      "Amorim has probably just gone: 'I just have to outscore teams', with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko up front. Bruno Fernandes playing as well. And I don't think he'll do that.",
      "I will be shocked if he's still in charge if Man Utd don't beat Burnley. But they will beat Burnley! It's a nice game.",
      "Erik ten Hag had that as well: three or four games without a win and then second-bottom of the league came. They just won that game and then lost three or four games again.",
      "It's just going to keep on covering the cracks. They will be called Pollyfilla United!",
      "I don't think Amorim will be shy to go: 'I've had enough. I can't do anything. I've done what I can'.",
      "I don't think he is one to put himself through pain to get his pay-off. I don't know the man, but [the way he is] coming across, I think he's an honest man and will be honest with himself. But I think they will beat Burnley.",
      "For me, I would have said yes. You don't win league titles, World Cups or European Championships without good goalkeepers.",
      "Onana doesn't save points, the goalkeepers lose points at Man Utd. So as soon as you lose points, that's a worry.",
      "They need a new goalkeeper. I see Gianluigi Donnarumma's around - why don't they go for him? But again, they've used their money in other positions.",
      "They need legs in midfield. No one has ever won a tournament or league without legs in midfield.",
      "They bought Sesko for £70m and he's taking the 10th penalty? I thought he had a broken leg when he stepped up. I thought he must be that injured that he's taking the 10th penalty.",
      "And then I heard people saying that he didn't want to miss or take that pressure. He's a £70m player! He's coming to score goals for Man Utd to take them back to where they should belong and he's taking the 10th penalty?",
      "He has to be in the top five. He's taking a penalty from 12 yards and the goalkeeper can't come off his line!",
      "I forgot that he was playing and then when he stepped up for the 10th penalty... wow."

      "Saturday 30 August 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows is back to offer his predictions and insight across the Premier League, tipping a 5/1 double.",
      "This is one of those fixtures that jumps off the page if you are into backing cards. We have a London derby and crucially we're in a matchday before an international break where historically the card count climbs.",
      "Across the last 10 Premier League seasons, there have typically been 0.64 more yellow cards per game during the final matchday before the first international break, compared with the season average.",
      "Last season for example, the 10 games on Matchday Three produced 5.6 cards per game. That's a big number.",
      "So, why the spike?",
      "Tough one, but perhaps players, particularly those on the fringes of their national team, want to stay sharp, show commitment and impress selectors. And with no club fixture for two weeks, suspensions feel a little less weighty. So perhaps tackles fly in.",
      "The over 4.5 cards line here is 10/11 with Sky Bet and that rates as a great starting point for building a bet.",
      "Some prices scream value, others scream \"trap.\" Manchester United to beat Burnley at 4/11? As MC Hammer once suggested, don't touch this.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have been consistently an unreliable betting proposition, especially against any side that can string three passes together under pressure. See Grimsby.",
      "Of course, Amorim overall has lost 16 of 29 Premier League games in charge. That doesn't help.",
      "United's name alone keeps them falsely short in markets which has been a cracking edge to exploit in recent years. It's certainly relevant here as the bulky transfer fees to bring in the new strike force are influencing United's probabilities of winning matches without any evidence to back it up yet. The end might be near for Amorim if he can't find the answers.",
      "Burnley on the draw no bet at 11/2 with Sky Bet is a real runner.",
      "This one has that delicious mix of ingredients I crave when searching for an edge: a dangerous set-piece side like Brentford possessing a centre-back who is due a goal.",
      "Even without Thomas Frank, Brentford continue to be the most effective side in the league from dead-ball situations. The clue is hiring the set piece as manager in that regard.",
      "Since the start of the 23/24 season, they rank second for expected goals from set pieces (33.2) and opened this campaign already creating 1.3 worth of expected goals from such situations, including scoring from one against Bournemouth in midweek.",
      "The set-up is relentlessly rehearsed and it's producing chances for the same players every week.",
      "Sepp van den Berg has had at least a shot in 14 of his last 16 starts at centre-back for the Bees, posting a total of 17 shots in total. At a first goalscorer price of 25/1, he's an outrageous value for a defender with clear licence to attack. His first goal for Brentford could be just around the corner.",
      "The Richarlison redemption movement is not a narrative many saw coming this season.",
      "Thomas Frank is a master at coaching forward players, just look at his body of work at Brentford: Ollie Watkins, Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. Frank has unlocked the Richarlison we saw at Everton - playing aggressively and looking hungry to make a difference. Of course, he scored twice in their last home game with Burnley and looks the bet here at 9/2 to score first.",
      "Bournemouth under Andoni Iraola want to press high, play front foot, and squeeze opponents, but that leaves big gaps in behind, particularly through the middle where their centre-backs are encouraged to play aggressively. It's going to take time to settle into a new defensive rhythm having lost Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi. Home win.",
      "This is a great time of the season for spotting players the markets haven't quite priced up correctly yet. And right now, Jack Grealish to register an assist is exactly that.",
      "Grealish could be about to cook up a storm. In his new role at Everton, the early signs are very positive for him having a huge influence on games. He's been drifting into left-half space, just outside the box and Everton have been feeding the ball down that flank.",
      "The markets still price Grealish's assist odds like he's stuck in his Manchester City mode, where he was tasked with cutting inside, recycling the ball and making the safe play. But at Everton, under a more direct and counter-attacking system, he's playing with far more verticality and is a creative force - as shown by his two assists last weekend against Brighton and three chances created in midweek against Mansfield.",
      "He is 7/2 with Sky Bet to grab another in a very winnable game for the Toffees.",
      "One of the early trends to put lots of weight on is promoted teams being very hard to beat at home.",
      "Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester only won six home games between them in the last campaign, but Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland are three from three so far. The atmosphere, energy and early-season excitement mean places like Elland Road are horrible places for opposition teams to play. Everton found that out on the opening matchday.",
      "And, let's call it as it is: no Alexander Isak, no Anthony Gordon and no proven striker means the chance of no goals for Newcastle is live. Strip away the strikers, throw in a midfield missing bite without Joelinton and Sandro Tonali, and Leeds have a fantastic chance of registering another maximum points haul. The home win at 12/5 with Sky Bet merits respect.",
      "The market is completely overlooking a new strand of Erling Haaland that might be about to explode. His headed goals numbers.",
      "Of his 87 Premier League strikes, 15 of them have been headers anyway but that metric is going to be on the increase based on City's new stylistic approach in the final third. It was clear from the outset of the game against Wolves that the inclusion of Tijjani Reijnders has added a directness to what City now do.",
      "City weren't turning back inside looking for options, they were looking to hit Haaland inside the area with early crosses.",
      "Haaland is 6ft 4in remember, and built like an Olympic discus thrower - he is suited to this style. He's recorded five headed shots in his two games this season and a headed goal is on the way. Timing is everything so jumping on now at 9/2 with Sky Bet for Haaland to score a header could be a wise move.",
      "The matchday before the first international break always hits hard.",
      "Just as the season is gathering momentum, we're hit with the prospect of England vs Andorra again. Sigh.",
      "An interesting betting angle developing in this final matchday before an international break is that the goal average goes up when analysing it against the season average.",
      "In the last six seasons on the matchday before the first international break, the goals per game average is at 3.3, from a sample size of 60 games. If you compare that figure to the average goals per game across those six seasons in the Premier League, which is at 2.8, we're seeing 0.5 more goals scored per game in this matchday. A huge difference in a low-scoring sport like football.",
      "That makes the over 2.5 goals line of interest here at Evens with Sky Bet. Having watched West Ham in all three of their matches so far this season, Forest could clear this line on their own. The Hammers have conceded 11 goals and there doesn't seem to be any signs of Graham Potter going back to basics to address the clear problem.",
      "Ask yourself this: would Arne Slot and Mikel Arteta take a draw right now? The answer is yes, isn't it? Categorically.",
      "That makes the draw a huge runner from a betting point of view.",
      "It's very unusual to have a fixture played before Gameweek four involving two title rivals. Looking at the past trends when looking at this type of fixture played early on in the season, draws are very common.",
      "The last five fixtures in the Premier League before Gameweek four to be played between teams that finished that season in the top three all ended in stalemates - the most recent of which was Arsenal's 2-2 with Manchester City last season.",
      "The draw here is the bet at 23/10 with Sky Bet. It's the bet of the weekend.",
      "If you need some evidence of why Oliver Glasner is such an incredible manager, just look at his record against Unai Emery, who is arguably regarded as the best pound-for-pound manager in Europe.",
      "Glasner has won four of the last five meetings with Emery with the aggregate score reading a hefty 17-4 in favour of the Austrian.",
      "Emery just hasn't found a way of breaking down Palace's mid-to-low block and Glasner's tactic of utilising Ismaila Sarr's pace and power has been so dangerous.",
      "Sarr has been phenomenal in these fixtures, registering seven goal involvements in his last three appearances against Villa. That included two goals and an assist in the 3-0 FA Cup semi-final win. He is 2/1 with Sky Bet to either score or assist again.",
