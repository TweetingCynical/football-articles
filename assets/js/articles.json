      "Manchester United won't be seeing their Africa Cup of Nations trio any time soon - but Ruben Amorim can at least take heart from the fact they are being managed carefully while on international duty.",
      "United have been seriously depleted in recent matches, with Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui away at AFCON, while Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Mason Mount have all picked up injuries. It has coincided with the busiest period of the season, forcing Amorim to adapt.",
      "Those adaptions were going well when a much-changed side held on to record a 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. But a 1-1 draw against the Premier League's bottom side, Wolves, quickly dispelled any hint of optimism, potentially sending Amorim back to the drawing board.",
      "United were pretty uninspired in attack against Wolves and needed a fluky deflected effort from Joshua Zirkzee to find the back of the net. How the Portuguese boss must have wished he could call upon Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "He therefore won't have been delighted to see that Morocco, Cameroon and Ivory Coast all made it out of the group stages at AFCON. Mazraoui, Mbeumo and Amad are now looking forward to knockout matches in Morocco, rather than United's game against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Cameroon came from 1-0 down to beat Mozambique 2-1 on New Year's Eve, while defending champions Ivory Coast also mounted a comeback to beat Gabon 3-2 and top Group F. The results mean that Cameroon will play South Africa in the last 16, while Ivory Coast will face Burkina Faso. Morocco had already booked their knockout match against Tanzania on Sunday.",
      "Mid-season tournaments are always a tricky thing to negotiate for club managers, who wish their players well but ultimately have selfish motives. They want them back as quickly as possible and without any injuries.",
      "So Amorim will have been pleased to see Mbeumo taken off at half-time in Cameroon's win against Mozambique - not because of an injury, but to manage his minutes. Amad, meanwhile, started Ivory Coast's game on the bench and came on as a 76th-minute substitute.",
      "Morocco and Cameroon play their last 16 games on Sunday - the same day United travel to Elland Road to face Leeds - while Ivory Coast are next in action on Tuesday. It means that, in theory, if their national sides lose, Mazraoui and Mbeumo could be back with United in time for their trip to Turf Moor to play Burnley on Wednesday, January 7.",
      "Amad, however, wouldn't be back until the FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton on Sunday, January 11, at the earliest, if Ivory Coast are beaten by Burkina Faso.",
      "Amorim will therefore have to continue to put his faith in United's academy players, who have been given rare opportunities to play first-team minutes. Jack Fletcher and Bendito Mantato came off the bench against Wolves, while Tyler Fredricson got minutes in the win over Newcastle.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson warned against clubs using the January transfer window to find a quick fix. Manchester United have been linked with several deals in the New Year, but the legendary manager advised teams to avoid big-money moves during the winter window.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side are chasing a return to Champions League football but currently sit two points off fourth-placed Liverpool, who could extend the gap with a win over Leeds on Thursday night. Though there have been signs of improvement across the campaign, United’s recent stalemate with Wolves reminded fans of their team’s shortcomings.",
      "The transfer window offers Amorim an opportunity to strengthen his squad, both in the short and long term. However, Ferguson previously explained why he believed making major signings in January was not worth the risk.",
      "In 2012, Ferguson stated that no marquee January signing had ever been an instant success. \"I've never seen it work, a player come in January, sign for big money and settle before the start of next season,” the United boss told The Independent.",
      "He added: \"To go into the market in January you never get full value, people think you're desperate so ask for more.\"",
      "Ferguson largely stuck to his own advice throughout his tenure, despite two of his best-ever signings both arriving in January 2006. Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra cost a combined £12.5million from their respective clubs but did not immediately establish themselves as stars, taking time to settle in at Old Trafford.",
      "While the success rate of major January signings is mixed, there are notable exceptions, including United skipper Bruno Fernandes. Focusing on the current transfer window, United are claimed to have assembled an eight-man shortlist of centre midfielders to bolster Amorim’s team.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Nottingham Forest ’s Elliot Anderson is top of the club’s wishlist, though a deal is unlikely as his team continue to battle relegation. Brighton’s highly-rated Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton were both heavily linked with United in the summer.",
      "England international Conor Gallagher has previously been touted with swapping Atletico Madrid for Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Everton’s James Garner has also been linked with a return to his boyhood club.",
      "Other options mentioned in the report are Bournemouth's Tyler Adams, Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes and Portugal international Ruben Neves, who currently plays for Al-Hilal. Whether United opt to spend big in January remains to be seen but Amorim has been short of midfield options in recent weeks.",
      "Injuries to Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo saw United start with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte in midfield against Wolves, with youngster Jack Fletcher being introduced at half-time. Ferguson would support Amorim utilising the club’s academy talent to solve the club’s midfield issue, rather than seeking an expensive solution in January.",
      "One of the only exceptions Ferguson made during his reign was to sign Louis Saha from Fulham in early 2004, who instantly began repaying his £12.85m fee with seven goals in 14 games. Experienced striker Henrik Larsson was also brought in on a short-term loan as Ferguson sought an immediate boost in 2007. However, the vast majority of his January dealings focused on long-term prospects.",
      "Wilfried Zaha became the last signing of the Ferguson era when he completed his £10m move from Crystal Palace in January 2013. Viewed as a player for the future, he was loaned back to Palace. In the following campaign, Zaha made just four appearances during his sole season at United before rejoining Palace permanently that summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The January transfer window is shaping up to be an intriguing one for Manchester United. Over the past weeks and months, several high-profile stars have been linked with moves to the Theatre of Dreams, while a number of established squad members look to be nearing the exit door.",
      "Historically, United's mid-season transfers have been hit and miss. For every game-changing arrival like Nemanja Vidic or Bruno Fernandes, there has been an Alexis Sanchez or a Dong Fangzhuo.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad will aim to carry their relatively strong end-of-2025 momentum into the New Year and start the campaign strongly, as the club pursues its first top-four finish in three seasons. Navigating the January window successfully could be crucial - not just for turning United's season into a memorable one, but also in cementing Amorim's long-term position at the club.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has been in sensational form at Bournemouth this season, attracting serious interest from United as a potential solution to their lack of width and firepower up top. His ability to take on defenders and finish clinically has boosted his profile significantly in recent months, with a release clause making him an appealing mid-season target.",
      "However, United seem to have slipped behind in the race, with rivals Manchester City closing in on his signature. Reports suggest a deal at the Etihad Stadium could be completed this week, meaning United supporters might see the Ghanaian in blue rather than red this winter.",
      "Crystal Palace's midfielder has become one of the Premier League's most wanted deep-lying playmakers due to his outstanding passing and calmness under pressure. Amorim reportedly sees him as the perfect 'metronome' to control the tempo of his 3-4-3 system and facilitate transitions from the defensive third.",
      "Signing Wharton will not be cheap, with Palace expected to demand at least £70million for their star - and possibly much more to sanction a mid-season transfer. While United's interest is genuine, a January deal is considered difficult, as the Eagles aim to retain their squad until summer.",
      "Carlos Baleba has impressed United scouts as a high-energy, all-action midfielder capable of rejuvenating the current squad. His capacity to break up play and surge forward with the ball fits perfectly with the high-pressing requirements of modern United football.",
      "Brighton are known as tough negotiators and are likely to insist on a fee close to £100m given his long-term promise, as they did in the summer. While United are said to be eager to secure the Cameroonian, Brighton's valuation may make a move this month unlikely.",
      "After a breakthrough season at Nottingham Forest, Elliot Anderson has become a top midfield target for several leading clubs. His technical skill in tight areas and tireless work rate make him stand out in both the Premier League and Thomas Tuchel's England squad.",
      "Forest are reportedly seeking at least £100m for the former Newcastle United player and are unlikely to consider a mid-season sale. Coupled with strong interest from Manchester City and Chelsea, a January move appears highly challenging.",
      "Stuttgart's playmaker has been identified as a refined alternative for United's midfield, offering exceptional football intelligence and advanced ball progression. Excelling in the Bundesliga and for Germany, he is viewed as ready to step straight into a top European club.",
      "Stiller reportedly has a release clause around £34million, effective in 2026. United could see him as a cost-efficient option compared with other targets - a consideration made even more relevant given injuries and possible departures in their midfield.",
      "In what would be both a sentimental and strategic acquisition, United are reportedly exploring a return for former academy graduate James Garner from Everton to strengthen squad depth. Garner has developed into a dependable Premier League performer, whose energy and tactical awareness would offer a low-risk midfield solution.",
      "Garner's contract runs until the end of the season, allowing the Red Devils to potentially secure him at a reduced cost if Everton are unwilling to lose him for free in the summer.",
      "Ex-Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher has struggled for playing time at Atletico Madrid this season and is reportedly eager to return to England to secure a spot in the 2026 World Cup squad. United value his 'engine' and Premier League experience, seeing him as an immediate boost to midfield intensity.",
      "Atletico are understood to be willing to consider a sale at around £30m, though United may be able to negotiate a lower price given Gallagher's limited appearances this term. It may not be a headline-grabbing move, but Gallagher could be a clever addition for a United side short on energy and depth in central midfield.",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt wing-back Nathaniel Brown has come onto United's radar as a solution for their ongoing left-sided issues. His pace and ability to offer width in a back-five make him a highly tactical fit for Amorim's system.",
      "As an emerging Bundesliga talent, the 22-year-old could cost around £50m, representing a high-risk option given his lack of top-level experience. Still, with United in need of elite wing-backs, Brown could be a gamble worth pursuing.",
      "Although hailed as one of United's brightest prospects in 2024, Kobbie Mainoo has dropped out of Amorim's first-team plans and is expected to leave in January. The midfielder wants regular playing time, especially with the World Cup approaching, and is reportedly pushing for a loan.",
      "Several top European clubs are monitoring his situation should a temporary move be approved. However, with United short in midfield, the club are hesitant to allow him to leave without first finding a replacement. A loan appears likely, but an incoming signing may need to come first.",
      "Following a difficult spell on the sidelines and limited first-team opportunities, Tyrell Malacia is widely expected to depart this winter to restart his career.",
      "With his contract expiring in summer, United are keen to sell rather than lose him for free - and are reportedly open to bids as low as £3m for the Dutchman.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has struggled to replicate the goal-scoring form that prompted his move from Bologna. Reports indicate AS Roma have made a formal loan proposal with an obligation to buy, as the striker is keen to return to Serie A.",
      "United are reviewing the offer but may wait until a replacement is secured before approving the move. This transfer looks highly likely, with all parties aligned on a fresh start.",
      "Despite his recent arrival, speculation suggests Ugarte may not fit the specific midfield style Amorim wants. While still a top-class ball-winner, interest from other European clubs has raised questions over his long-term future at Old Trafford.",
      "United are open to selling, but only for the right fee. Turkish giants Galatasaray are among the interested clubs and are reportedly preparing a loan-plus-option-to-buy bid this month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The turn of the year also marks the beginning of the January transfer window. United have been linked with several deals, both incomings and outgoings, as Amorim seeks to improve his team in their pursuit of a Champions League place.",
      "Whether a change will come through the manager placing more trust in youth prospects or refining his squad in the transfer market remains to be seen. However, one player has revealed why he chose to leave Old Trafford during Amorim’s reign. Here is a closer look at some of the biggest stories surrounding the club.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim admitted that he purposely avoided bringing on more academy starlets as his team chased a winning goal against Wolves. The club endured a disappointing 1-1 draw on Tuesday night, with Wolves picking up just their third point of the campaign.",
      "The United boss opted to replace goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee with young midfielder Jack Fletcher at the interval, with Leny Yoro and debutant Bendito Mandato being brought on later in the game. However, Amorim avoided utilising the attacking options of Shea Lacey and Chido Obi as he felt they would further disrupt his team, given United's lengthy list of absentees.",
      "“It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,” Amorim explained.",
      "\"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid. You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has revealed what convinced him to leave Manchester United this summer. The striker had previously been determined to stay at Old Trafford before securing a deadline day loan move to Napoli.",
      "It has proven to be a beneficial switch for Hojlund, who has already bettered his league goal tally from last season. The 22-year-old, who has scored six in 12 Serie A matches, has shared what eventually persuaded him to leave United.",
      "When asked why he changed his decision, Hojlund told Sports Illustrated: \"United made it very quite clear that I wasn't part of their plans for this year, coming into the season. And with no European football, I think Napoli saw an opportunity to go and get me. As soon as I heard of their interest, I made it quite obvious to my camp and the people around me that I only wanted to go there.”",

      "It's been an incredibly productive year for Rashford, who earned a recall to the England squad on the back of his impressive form during temporary spells at both Aston Villa and Barcelona. Rashford has managed to capture the best moments of his year in nine photographs on Instagram, predominantly featuring him in a Barcelona shirt.",
      "In his message, he wrote: \"As 2025 comes to a close, I'm grateful for a year of change and self reflection. Stepping into 2026 feeling excited, motivated, and ready to be ambitious both in sport and life. MR14 [red and blue heart emoji].\"",
      "Whilst there's no direct reference to United, there is a Villa photograph that shows the spot-kick he converted against Manchester City, which clearly indicates his pride in that particular moment.",
      "Spain's winter break has meant Rashford and Barcelona have enjoyed an extended rest period - with their most recent match taking place 10 days ago on Sunday, December 21.",
      "Rashford started that 2-0 triumph on the subs bench, but he then entered the action for the closing 28 minutes. Hansi Flick chose to field Raphinha, Fermin Lopez and Lamine Yamal as his attacking three behind the striker, with the same trio getting the nod from the start in the Champions League victory against Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Rashford subsequently provided an assist after coming off the bench in that match. Despite being overlooked on two occasions, Rashford responded to the team selection decisions in exemplary fashion, according to Flick.",
      "He said: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected and the last time I checked with him he replied me; 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions',\" Flick said on Rashford. \"'The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important'.",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I'm so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",
      "It comes as little shock that most Spanish media outlets are suggesting that Flick would be keen for Barcelona to secure Rashford from United on a permanent basis next summer.",
      "The purchase option included in his transfer is understood to be approximately £26million. Despite the relatively modest fee, questions remain over whether Barcelona could actually meet that figure, though, given their widely documented financial struggles.",
      "Certain reports suggest that Barcelona must decide between Rashford and a high-profile striker signing, given the long-term worries over 37-year-old Robert Lewandowski.",

However, Sir Alex has admitted his career could have taken a very different path following a regrettable episode in the 1960s.",

      "\"For two years, between 1961 and 1963, we didn't talk. One night I went out and I got drunk and I ended up in a fight and ended up in jail. I went to court and got fined £3. I was a bit of a black sheep.",

      "United had taken the lead through Joshua Zirkzee in the first half, but found themselves level just before the half-time break thanks to Ladislav Krejci’s header. That is how the score remained until full-time, with Wolves securing just their third point of the season.",

Amorim has been criticised for his in-game substitutions, particularly opting to replace Ayden Heaven with fellow defender Leny Yoro against Wolves, despite the team being in search of a winner.",
      "Speaking on his The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast earlier this month, Scholes didn't hold back on his thoughts, saying: \"I don't think this manager gets this club full stop. I just don't think he's the right man.",
      "\"United is about risk and entertainment more than anything. Having fans on the edge of their seat, ready to go. Wingers who beat people, shots on goal, bits of skills. There’s nothing there. That's from the club.",
      "\"We talked about this, this is a different club. They've got Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, who are probably brilliant at their job and what they do. They're not United, they don't have a clue what it is like to buy a Manchester United player, to bring a Manchester United manager in.",
      "\"If you go to Sporting Lisbon and watch - they play three at the back. Right away, that (should be) a no. United never do that. They can’t do that.",
      "\"It’s been proven over years and years and years and I’m talking even before Sir Alex Ferguson. It was always about, 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2. It’s about entertaining people, but he hasn’t got that in him.\"",
      "Referencing Amorim’s changes, comparing them to legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Scholes added: \"He [Amorim] brought four defenders on against West Ham.",
      "\"If we went 1-0 up, the manager [Ferguson] always said, 'Two, three, four'. I remember once, we were playing Chelsea and went 1-0 up, and we sat back a little bit because Chelsea were a good team.",
      "\"The manager went absolutely nuts after the game. 'That doesn't happen here. When you score one, you go for two. You go for the throat every single time.' I just don't think he gets it.\"",
      "The comments have now been shared again on social media with many fans agreeing with what the former midfielder said. But United don’t have too long to dwell on the draw.",
      "They are back in action again on Sunday, when they travel to take on rivals Leeds United at Elland Road (12.30pm kick-off). They then travel to take on Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night (8.15pm kick-off).",

      "Napoli are planning to sign Rasmus Hojlund permanently from Manchester United and consider the move a \"formality\" with reports claiming they'll land him for £43million - leaving the Premier League side out of pocket once more.",
      "The Dane was signed in Erik ten Hag's second summer, joining from Atalanta in August 2023 for £64m. His age was flagged as a concern, but a long-term view was taken. But after 14 goals in 62 Premier League outing it appears as if United will cut their losses.",
      "The reported figure means the Manchester outfit will end up taking a £21m hit on a player just three years after landing him. If he does leave, Hojlund would add himself to the list of players who ultimately underwhelmed from the Ten Hag era - of which there are many.",
      "He took months to score his first league goal and his shortcomings in the final third ultimately prompted a rejig in the summer with Hojlund leaving for Italy and more than £200m being spent on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The transfer dealings from the Ten Hag era continued to paint a bleak picture and have cost United dearly. Antony was the headline signing when the Dutchman first arrived - the club eventually parting with £82m to land him from Ajax.",
      "He scored on debut but that was about as good as things got and the Brazilian headed out on loan to Antony in January, later making his move permanent in the summer. The Spanish side would land his signature for just £21.6m - representing a massive loss financially for the Old Trafford outfit.",
      "Casemiro was bought in for an initial £60m and came with winning experience and pedigree from Real Madrid. Eyebrows were raised at the fee paid for a player in his 30s, but his initial impact kept that quiet. However in the years since he's been unable to have the same impact and his mammoth wages have made him impossible to move on.",
      "His contract expires in the summer and there is a very realistic possibility he leaves for nothing. Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte, who cost £87.5m between them, are both being linked with moves away and neither will recoup their fee if they do leave.",
      "It means the transfer that took place across the Ten Hag era could well cost the club more than £150m in losses. The frustration for United will be seeing players leave and flourish. Scott McTominay, a homegrown talent, is among them given his success at Napoli.",
      "And now his team-mate Hojlund is doing similarly. The striker scoring nine timed already this season. Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna has told Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport: \"We did everything we could to sign him.",
      "\"There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it. There's an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.\"",

      "The Scottish boss, who arrived at United in 1986, brought Beckham to the club five years after taking charge. The midfielder was among the celebrated Class of '92, which included Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who secured the FA Youth Cup triumph in the 1991/92 campaign.",
      "The Leytonstone native then earned his senior debut in September 1992 before cementing his place in United's starting eleven. Beckham clocked up 394 first-team outings for the Red Devils, netting 85 times whilst laying on 121 assists.",
      "His trophy haul included six Premier League crowns, two FA Cup victories and one Champions League triumph. The former England captain clearly holds fond memories of his Old Trafford days.",
      "On Tuesday morning, he marked Ferguson's New Year's Eve birthday milestone with heartfelt social media posts.",
      "His first Instagram story featured a training ground snap alongside Ferguson, captioned: \"Happy birthday boss [red love heart emoji] @manutd.\"",
      "A follow-up post, showing him putting pen to paper on his maiden United deal, read: \"Have the best day boss [red love heart emoji] @manutd.\"",
      "Beckham departed United in the summer of 2003 to join Real Madrid for £32.3million. He went on to feature 159 times for Los Blancos before switching to LA Galaxy, AC Milan and then wrapping up his career at Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "While he tasted success after his United exit, his time under Ferguson at Old Trafford remained his most cherished period, racking up more appearances there than at all his other clubs put together.",
      "In 2021, Beckham reflected on his bond with Ferguson. \"The sense of community and family that Sir Alex ensured we all felt was so important,\" the former United star told premierleague.com.",
      "\"I was lucky to be in a team that I had supported since I was a boy and with a group of players who I had played with for such a long period of time.",

      "\"Sir Alex was an incredible manager and there's no way we would have been able to achieve what we did without him. He will always be an inspiration to me.\"",

      "Smith played for Leicester City between 1982 and 1987, where he scored 84 goals. His outstanding performances caught Ferguson's attention, with the Scot having been at Old Trafford for just a few months when he made contact with the striker.",
      "Much to Smith's surprise, he received a sudden telephone call from the Manchester United boss in early 1987. But the ex-England forward, who recalls watching Coronation Street at his parents’ house when his mum answered the phone, snubbed the offer in favour of George Graham’s Arsenal.",
      "Speaking to ex-Arsenal team-mate David Seaman on the Seaman Says podcast, he revealed: \"I spoke to Alex Ferguson. I was getting a bit of interest. One January evening, I was living with my mum and dad still and we were watching Coronation Street, I’ll always remember it.",
      "\"The phone goes in the hall and my mum picks it up and she says, ‘Alan, it’s Alex Ferguson on the phone for you.’ I thought she misheard the name.",
      "\"Alex had only been at United for about a year and they were struggling. So it’s not like it was ‘the Sir Alex’ calling but he was obviously a big name, he’s the Man United manager.",
      "\"I went into the hall and spoke to him. He said he wanted me to wait until the summer when I would have been a free agent. I said, ‘Mr Ferguson, I’m sorry but I’ve made up my mind, I want to join Arsenal.’ Arsenal wanted to sign me on deadline day, I had already spoken to them in a roundabout way.",
      "\"It was a short conversation, I put the phone down and thought, ‘Have I done the right thing there, saying no to the Manchester United manager?’ But they went four of five years really without winning anything and Alex was close to getting the sack.\"",
      "Smith moved to Arsenal in March 1987 but was sent back to Leicester on loan for the remainder of that campaign. Despite his early concerns about whether he'd made the correct choice, the next few years in north London vindicated his decision.",
      "He left his mark for the Gunners by finding the net in the historic First Division title-clinching match between Arsenal and Liverpool at Anfield in 1989. Graham's men ended an 18-year drought to win the championship in spectacular style, with Michael Thomas scoring the second goal in stoppage time to steal the crown from Liverpool.",
      "Despite a rocky start in Manchester, the failed transfer didn't hamper Sir Alex at United as he clinched his first league title in 1992/93 after winning the FA Cup in 1989/90. The Scot, who celebrates his 84th birthday on New Year’s Eve, went on to become the most successful manager in English football history with 13 league titles.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has revealed what persuaded him to leave Manchester United during the summer transfer window. The young striker was loaned to Napoli, despite initially insisting he would remain and compete for his place under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United pocketed a £5.2million loan fee and stand to gain an additional £38m should the obligation-to-buy clause be triggered. The 22-year-old has displayed encouraging form under Antonio Conte, netting six goals in 12 league appearances.",
      "During pre-season, Hojlund had been resolute about fighting for his place at United. Yet the Denmark international ultimately completed a deadline day switch to Napoli, linking up once again with former team-mate Scott McTominay.",
      "When questioned about his change of heart, Hojlund explained to Sports Illustrated: \"United made it very quite clear that I wasn't part of their plans for this year, coming into the season.",
      "\"And with no European football, I think Napoli saw an opportunity to go and get me. As soon as I heard of their interest, I made it quite obvious to my camp and the people around me that I only wanted to go there.\"",
      "Hojlund shared that a brief discussion with Napoli manager Conte sealed his decision to join the reigning Serie A champions. While he was eager to guarantee regular playing time and had experience in Italian football, Hojlund acknowledged that the chance to work alongside Conte was another crucial factor.",
      "\"He's an incredible coach, I've only seen him do good things everywhere he's been,\" Hojlund said. \"Obviously, that was a big part of it. When he calls, you just have to say yes.\"",
      "The United loanee has been on fire recently, netting four goals in his last three league matches, matching his Premier League total from the previous season. Despite his struggles at United, Hojlund looks back fondly on his spell at Old Trafford, particularly his debut season when he scored 16 goals.",
      "Hojlund's high-profile move in 2023, potentially worth up to £72m, was met with much fanfare. Although his goal tally didn't quite live up to his hefty price tag, the Napoli striker has no regrets about his decision to join United.",
      "\"There was a lot of attention and a lot of pressure, obviously,\" he admitted. \"I felt it was hard for me not to take that step, I was a United supporter. I think I did well; you could argue that maybe I needed another year or whatever, but I felt it was the right step for me.",
      "\"I feel like I did well, in my first year especially - I became top scorer, I had a good campaign in the Champions League and won a trophy with the guys.",

      "Manchester United were booed off on Tuesday night after an abject display against Wolves - described by Gary Neville as \"the baddest of the bad\".",
      "It was a noise the home players had to cop as they became only the third team this season to fail to beat Wolves. Ruben Amorim has endured a tough spell as head coach, but even the great Sir Alex Ferguson had to face the music when it came. Safe to say, he wasn't a fan.",
      "Neville is among those to remark on how loyal the United fanbase are. Even if they do have a global pull, the 76,000 seats at Old Trafford are always sold out. Even when the team have been far from the best.",
      "That was the case in 2005 when the home faithful booed the Manchester side off their own turf after Blackburn Rovers left with all three points. At this point Ferguson was two years without a Premier League title. That run would extend to three.",
      "But the faith in him was wavering among some. It was only September and Ferguson's team were 10 points behind leaders Chelsea in the top flight having played just six games. The Scot, never one to shy away from a media confrontation, didn't hold back.",
      "\"No, I am not going to explain myself,\" he said in the days after. Supporters had also grown frustrated by the change of system, which had clearly not had the desired affect. They had chanted \"4-4-2\" during the defeat to Blackburn - a call for a return to the system that brought previous success.",
      "A founding member of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (Imusa), said that fans had no other way to voice their frustration other than to boo - but that it was no knee jerk reaction to a loss.",
      "\"What happened on Saturday was a build-up of ill feeling that has gone on for a long time,\" he said. \"The supporters have been accustomed to mediocrity for too long and this was the moment when they decided that enough was enough. You can argue whether it was good, bad or indifferent to boo the manager but what other option do supporters have to show their displeasure?\"",
      "He went as far as to suggest Ferguson should've walked away in a blaze of glory following the treble success in 1999. Or in 2002 when he had said he would call it a day.",
      "\"Ever since then there have been serious levels of underachievement,\" was one comment made. Ferguson's eye for a player was also questioned after several arrivals failed to deliver.",
      "The conclusion was: \"Over the last four years some of his signings have been so questionable that you have to wonder whether he has even seen these players before buying them.\"",
      "Ferguson would defend his team in the aftermath of the loss that led to the boos, claiming: \"Form has not been that bad. The loss against Blackburn was a travesty of a result because we missed some good chances. There's no point feeling sorry for yourself, you just have to get on with it and we did.\"",
      "Despite a recovery mission that season, which saw United put the pressure on Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, they would still fall short. Ending the year with the League Cup, which came about thanks to a win over Wigan in Cardiff, was some solace but not the prize anyone at the club wanted.",
      "Ferguson's second wind would come though. 2006 marked the end of the most challenging period for the Scot as the club set about winning a hat-trick of Premier League titles from 2007 - 2009. Sandwiched in between was a Champions League success that was spearheaded by Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo: a team that Ferguson regards as the greatest of his tenure.",

All the signs however point to Hojlund making a permanent move regardless. Napoli director Giovanni Manna has confirmed that both parties consider a switch a done deal already.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna told Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "Asked if a permanent move was already a formality, Manna replied: “As of today, I think so.” Manna’s comments come amid claims in Italy that Napoli are already drawing up the terms of Hojlund’s contract as a permanent player.",
      "It has been suggested that the forward will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause written into his deal in Naples - that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund, 22, has scored seven goals in 19 outings for the club this season.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said recently about Hojlund’s form.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund joined Man United from Atalanta in 2023 and he scored 16 goals across his debut season and followed that up with a further ten in his second season - albeit just four of those strikes came in the Premier League.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has always had faith in Marcus Rashford's ability to shine at Manchester United, despite the striker's well-documented issues with Ruben Amorim. The legendary Fergie, who turns 84 on Wednesday, has long been an admirer of Rashford and doesn't need any convincing of his talent.",
      "The 28-year-old has been showcasing his skills at Barcelona this season following a high-profile falling out with current United manager Amorim. After being loaned out to Aston Villa for the second half of last season, Rashford moved to Spain with the aim of reviving his form.",
      "He has certainly achieved that, netting seven goals and providing 11 assists for Hansi Flick's team. However, the England star's long-term future at Barcelona remains uncertain due to wage disputes.",
      "Spanish publication El Nacional previously reported that Rashford is unwilling to take a pay cut if he makes a permanent move to the LaLiga heavyweights. The forward agreed to a 25% salary reduction when he joined Barca in the summer, which reportedly sees him pocketing £12.1million a year.",
      "However, fellow Spanish outlet Sport has now suggested that a breakthrough has been made, with the talented forward open to discussing a wage decrease to fit within the club's salary cap. The U-turn is likely to disappoint Ferguson, who has always maintained that Rashford possessed the potential to achieve greatness at Old Trafford.",
      "The Telegraph reported that the legendary Scot told his closest sources that he'd envisaged managing the England international at United and stressed the importance of deploying Rashford's talents to maximise the squad's overall performance.",
      "The revered manager was also convinced he could unlock Rashford's optimal role if given the opportunity to work alongside him, acknowledging that many coaches mistakenly deploy the star in unsuitable positions.",
      "Following United's 2023 Carabao Cup triumph, Ferguson was emphatic that the forward delivers his most impressive performances operating off the left rather than centrally as a traditional number nine.",
      "He said: \"Well I don't think he's a striker. He operates from the left hand side which is fantastic. His finishing is always good, keeps his shots down which is really important.",
      "\"He's in a great vein of form and unfortunately for us he's the main source of goals, we could do with an extra one. But he's doing it.\"",
      "Fergie has also hailed Rashford's charitable endeavours after the star collected the Football Writers' Association Tribute award for his campaign against child food poverty. The former United boss heaped praise on Rashford's humanitarian efforts, even pledging up to £2million in matching contributions for the FareShare charity.",
      "Congratulating Rashford at the awards ceremony in 2021, Ferguson said: \"I would like to congratulate Marcus on his achievement and presentation (of the FWA Tribute Award) tonight. I have known him since being a kid of seven years of age, and seen him develop through the ranks of Manchester United into a truly wonderful person.",
      "\"Apart from his football life, what he has achieved in the last few months is quite astonishing, how he has helped the people in need is a truly amazing achievement. I would like to congratulate him on that. He has shown to young people in particular there is a different way of dealing with life.",
      "\"He has shown great humility, he has shown courage to do what he did, so this achievement is well deserved and should be recognised with what he has done. So Marcus, well done on a fantastic achievement.\"",
      "\"I wasn't nervous, I was just excited. That is the feeling that we got anyway being in and around the first-team, maybe passing them in the corridors, just small stuff like that, it builds your excitement and your hunger really.",
      "\"It's like a reminder that is where you want to get to and that's why a lot of players have come through during his [Ferguson] reign as manager and even now.\"",
      "Rashford has openly expressed his desire to have been managed by Ferguson, calling it his ultimate footballing ambition. Speaking about his respect for the legendary boss in 2021, he said: \"For me it was an unbelievable experience and I think for me that is probably the only regret I have ever had in my career, never having the chance to play under Sir Alex.",
      "\"It is something which will probably never going to happen now, but to be on the phone to him and just have 10 or 15 minutes conversation with him was amazing and I am pleased he was aware of the situation and he wanted to help as well, so it was brilliant.\"",
      "Given the mutual admiration between these two United legends, there's little doubt Ferguson could have unlocked Rashford's full potential had he been in charge today. However, that challenge now falls to Amorim, who must weigh up whether to persist with or move on from the homegrown talent should he make his way back to Old Trafford.",

      "Lisandro Martinez was left fuming after Manchester United were held by Wolves at Old Trafford and told his beleaguered team-mates that they \"have to win when they play at home\".",
      "The visitors were winless in their 18 games and had lost all but two of those, leaving them doomed at the bottom of the table. But they were able to take their points tally from two to three by earning a share of the spoils in Manchester, despite going behind in the first-half.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had put the Red Devils in front but Ladislav Krejci silenced the home crowd when he scored to earn Wolves' first point since October. Come full-time the Manchester outfit were booed off after an abject performance.",
      "It halts any momentum the team were gaining and whilst Martinez believes Wolves' position at the bottom is not a fair reflection of their quality, he insists United cannot be letting such games pass them by on their own patch.",
      "He said: \"Really disappointed. We can't come here at home and draw this game. We have to win when we play at home. The opponent has to suffer and we didn't get the three points.",
      "\"Very frustrating. The team gave everything. Just for a few moments, we conceded in the last moment of the first half, that can happen. We can deserve that, it's our responsibility. We played well with the ball in the first half but then we dropped too much, couldn't press their centre backs. They were comfortable with the ball and they started moving round and creating spaces.",
      "\"Wolves don't deserve the place they are, it's a strong team. We respect them. We have to take more risks. The lads are very disappointed, we expect better. We have to take it and accept it and go for the next one.\"",
      "Had Ruben Amorim's side won then they would've leaped into the top four ahead of Liverpool, at least momentarily, but instead they remain in sixth. Gary Neville was critical of the team's set-up from minute one and claimed it was on the head coach to take responsibility.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious 26-year tenure at Manchester United was not without its mistakes, with the legendary Scot acknowledging one of his most significant blunders. Jaap Stam, the towering Dutchman, was considered one of the world's best centre-backs around the turn of the century and was a formidable presence in the Red Devils' defence.",
      "However, after a major falling out with Ferguson, Stam was swiftly transferred to Lazio in Serie A, ending his three-year stint at Old Trafford. Their relationship reached a breaking point at a petrol station, where the Dutch defender's fate was decided.",
      "Stam had crossed a line by including several controversial comments in his 2001 autobiography, 'Head to Head'. Not only did he suggest that Ferguson had \"tapped him up\" when signing from PSV Eindhoven in 1998, he also claimed that the Scot actively encouraged United players to dive during matches.",
      "Stam revealed: \"It's got to the stage where he has even told us, 'Don't try and stay on your feet if you're in the box and get a slight kick.' He wants us to copy other sides we face in European competitions and go down to win a penalty.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, the revelations didn't sit well with Ferguson, who turns 84 on New Year's Eve. He was so furious about the entire affair that he dropped him from United's starting line-up for a trip to Aston Villa before promptly arranging to sell him to Lazio at the first available chance.",
      "In the days leading up to the transfer, tensions reached boiling point, with Stam walking out of training and making his views clear to his manager. Ferguson then tracked him down at a petrol station before telling him his Old Trafford days were finished.",
      "\"One morning, I told him what I thought and left the training ground on the spot,\" Stam later revealed. \"On the way home I received a phone call in my car from Fergie's secretary.",
      "\"She said that he wanted to speak to me. He came on the phone straightaway. Ferguson said, 'Where are you?' I said, 'Close to my house, at a petrol station.' Ferguson said, 'Wait there!' He jumped in his car and came straight to me.",
      "\"At the petrol station he parked his car and got in with me. He told me that I had to be transferred. Then he said, 'Will you please move to Lazio quickly?' I agreed to do it. Right there and then.",
      "\"One quick conversation in my car at a petrol station in Manchester was enough for me to leave that big club. When I think about it now, and I have never talked about it before, I find it unbelievable I let that, as a player, happen to me.\"",
      "Within a day, Stam had jetted off to Rome to join Lazio. Ferguson then put his trust in the up-and-coming Wes Brown and seasoned pro Laurent Blanc, who was quickly signed as Stam's replacement.",
      "Ferguson later expressed regret over his handling of the Stam situation, admitting he made an error in pushing the defender out of the club. He said in 2013: \"When I think of disappointments, obviously Jaap Stam was always a disappointment to me. I made a bad decision there.\"",
      "Gary Neville admitted last year that it caught him off guard, saying on the Stick to Football podcast: \"Jaap was the biggest one where I felt at the time that it was questionable. And the boss has said it was his biggest mistake, hasn't he, in his book?",
      "\"That was the one where I look at that transfer and think, 'He's the best centre back in the world. No one's beating him. No one's beating Jaap Stam!'\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson earned plenty of praise for his transfer dealings at Manchester United but even the legendary boss got it wrong on occasion. The iconic manager, who turns 84 on Wednesday, once branded midfielder Owen Hargreaves' spell at Old Trafford as \"a disaster\".",
      "The England international joined United from Bayern Munich in 2007. The £17million signing had secured four Bundesliga titles and lifted the Champions League during his spell at the German giants, while Hargreaves had also won plaudits with standout displays at the 2006 World Cup.",
      "A defensive midfielder, he was seen as a potential replacement for Roy Keane and showed early promise. Hargreaves featured 34 times in his first campaign as Ferguson's men captured a Premier League and Champions League double, even scoring his spot-kick in the dramatic penalty shootout triumph over Chelsea.",
      "However, his luck soon turned, with recurring patellar tendinitis keeping him out of action and effectively finishing his career. Hargreaves would manage just five more outings across the following three campaigns, prompting Ferguson to name him among his biggest disappointments.",
      "In his 2013 autobiography, Ferguson wrote: \"We started to put together a bid for him. But I studied his playing record and felt a tinge of doubt.",
      "\"I didn't feel a strong vibe about him. David Gill worked hard on the deal with Bayern. I met Owen's agent at the World Cup final in Berlin. Nice man, a lawyer. I told him we could develop Hargreaves at United.",
      "\"It turned out to be a disaster. Owen had no confidence in himself whatsoever. He didn't show nearly enough determination to overcome his physical difficulties, for my liking.",
      "\"I saw him opt for the easy choice too often in terms of training. He was one of the most disappointing signings of my career.\"",
      "\"I rang him, when I heard,\" Hargreaves said in 2021. \"I was surprised myself. My family were really surprised.",
      "\"I think anyone who's been around me knows that I left home at 15 alone, to go to a country where I couldn't speak the language to play football. I left the comfort of Bayern to play for Man United, because I wanted to represent Man United, to play for Sir Alex and be part of that great team.",
      "\"I never took the easy step. I played for a country I wasn't even born in because I wanted to be the best. I probably never should have been a professional football player, based on my start! But I worked my way and, obviously, didn't finish the way I wanted. A lot of things went into that.\"",
      "He added: \"As much as it was disappointing for him not having me play - because when I was fit, he played me all the time. I told him on the phone, I promised him, it broke me more than it did him. Because that was my career.",
      "\"To this day, I haven't done a day of sport since. I can't because of my knee. If you just forget the football side, my career changed from one day to the next and for a young man chasing a ball around all of his life, it was a pretty significant day. I haven't been able to play sport like that since. To say it went the way I envisioned would be a lie.\"",

      "To Manchester United fans, Sir Alex Ferguson has always been a figure of strength and resilience. Yet the period since his retirement in 2013 has pushed the iconic manager through trials that football never managed to inflict.",
      "The first major turning point came in May 2018, when he was struck by a sudden brain haemorrhage that demanded emergency, life-saving surgery. While in hospital, Sir Alex found himself asking \"how many sunny days I would see again\".",
      "Given the circumstances, his pessimism was understandable. Medical staff believed that his chances of survival upon arrival at Salford Royal Hospital were only 20 per cent.",
      "\"There were five brain haemorrhages that day,\" Ferguson, then aged 79, said in the 2021 documentary 'Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In'. \"Three died. Two survived. You know you are lucky.",
      "\"It was a beautiful day, I remember that. I wondered how many sunny days I would ever see again. I found that difficult.\"",
      "Early in his recovery, the 13-time Premier League champion worried that he might permanently lose his memory after a setback that left him unable to speak properly. \"I was trying to force it out but I couldn't get it out,\" he explained. \"One of the doctors came in and I was crying because I felt helpless.\"",
      "Looking back on the moment he collapsed at home, Ferguson confessed that feelings of \"loneliness\" and the fear of death entered his thoughts. \"The moments when you are on your own, there is that fear and loneliness that creeps into your mind,\" he said. \"You don't want to die. That is where I was at. These things did flash through my mind quite a lot.\"",
      "Although Ferguson eventually recovered fully, the years that followed brought significant changes to his personal life. Towards the end of 2023, Sir Alex was devastated by the death of his wife of 57 years, Lady Cathy, whom he often described as the \"bedrock\" of his life.",
      "He has also said she was the only person he never answered back to - a remarkable admission from a man famous for unleashing fearsome 'hairdryer treatments' on underperforming players.",
      "The couple first met in 1964 while working at a typewriter factory and married two years later. Cathy went on to have a crucial influence on Ferguson's career, offering stability and support while also shaping key moments, including persuading him to reverse his decision to retire in 2002.",
      "Following her death, Sir Alex acknowledged that he had \"struggled to leave the house.\" Consumed by grief, he opted to spend time travelling to distract himself, visiting destinations such as Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Bahrain.",
      "After returning home, he joined a dementia support group and later decided to sell his £3.25million Cheshire home, where he and Cathy had lived since 2010. Sir Alex now resides in the village of Goostrey, near Knutsford, living next door to his son Darren.",
      "Since stepping away from management, Manchester United has remained a constant presence in Ferguson's life. The legendary Scot continues to attend matches regularly, often watching from the directors' box.",
      "However, his paid role as a club ambassador was ended last year as part of wide-ranging cost-cutting measures introduced by owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The INEOS chairman, who bought a 25 per cent stake in his boyhood club in February 2024, has overseen hundreds of redundancies at United.",
      "Ferguson had reportedly been earning £2m annually and while he was described as \"grumpy\" by Ratcliffe when told the position would end, he ultimately responded with dignity. \"I take my hat off to Alex,\" Sir Jim said in March.",
      "\"I sat down with Alex, just the two of us in the room. And I said, 'Look, the club isn't where you may think it is. It is spending more than it's earning and we're going to finish up in some difficulties. Honestly, we can't really afford to continue to pay you £2m a year.'",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to leave it with you, let you have a think about it.' It was very grown up. Maybe a little bit grumpy at the beginning, but he got it. He came back three days later, after talking to his son and said, 'Fine, I'm going to step away from it. My decision.'\"",
      "He continued: \"I think it reflects really well on Alex because he put the club before himself.\"",
      "For someone whose identity was forged through authority, dominance and constant success, the hardships of recent years have exposed another side of Sir Alex Ferguson - one defined by vulnerability, humility and quiet resolve.",
      "The game once bent to his will, but illness, bereavement and upheaval have required a different resilience altogether. To countless fans, Ferguson will always be the indomitable force on the touchline. But perhaps his greatest victories have come away from the spotlight - in survival, in love and in learning to let go.",

      "In an ideal world, Manchester United would have already started their January transfer window with a bang. They were one of several clubs that were keen to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth, and although that ship hasn't yet sailed, it is now looking unlikely.",
      "Semenyo is set to leave Bournemouth this month, and United would have paid his £65million release clause, but as it stands, it looks like Manchester City are set to win the battle for the 25-year-old. United were strongly in the race, however.",
      "Rather than focusing on a signing to strengthen the attack, this approach for Semenyo was for United to bring forward the pursuit of a long-term target because he was going to be on the move now. It is a theme which is set to condition their January window.",
      "If Semenyo does opt for the Etihad, United won't switch attention to plan B. There isn't a desperate desire to improve the attack in this window.",
      "If anything, it is the midfield which needs work, and a deal there could depend on outgoings. United are planning a significant overhaul in the centre of the pitch this year, although they will be happy to wait until the summer window to kickstart that process.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has started the ball rolling on speculation around his own future again, although he won't be going anywhere this month. The same is true of Casemiro, who is out of contract in the summer. Manuel Ugarte is wanted by Galatasaray but is currently back in the team and unlikely to depart.",
      "The biggest story of the month is therefore likely to be Kobbie Mainoo, who wants to leave on loan to play regular football, having failed to start a Premier League game under Amorim this season. Napoli are keen to take the 20-year-old until the end of the season.",
      "Mainoo is due back from a calf injury shortly and his departure wouldn't be considered while Fernandes is out with a hamstring injury and Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim has made it clear he wants the academy graduate to stay and fight for his place and a loan move later in January might depend on whether the change in formation presents him with more opportunities and if Mainoo pushes to go. If he does, United might have to consider a move for a midfielder, although premium targets such as Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson will likely be out of reach in January.",
      "There could also be an exit for Joshua Zirkzee in January. Roma remain keen on the Dutch forward and are looking to put together a loan move that could include an option to buy. Zirkzee is only likely to be allowed to move once Amad and Mbeumo return from AFCON.",
      "There is also likely to be a January move for Tyrell Malacia, who was part of the bomb squad in the summer but was unable to find a new club. He made his first appearance in 11 months against Newcastle but will be made available this month.",

      "The January transfer window is now open and Reds head coach Ruben Amorim is eager to bolster his squad as they aim to ascend the Premier League standings and pose a serious threat to the Champions League positions. Currently, the Reds are sixth in the league after 19 games, just two points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool.",
      "However, they squandered a golden opportunity to overtake Arne Slot's team after a 1-1 draw with bottom-of-the-table Wolves at Old Trafford on Tuesday.",
      "United splashed out nearly £240million in the summer transfer window, but this figure could increase if the Reds decide to bring in reinforcements in January. They're on the hunt for a new central midfielder, with Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba topping their wish list.",
      "Meanwhile, there could be some departures from Old Trafford in January. Kobbie Mainoo remains the most talked-about potential exit, while Joshua Zirkzee, who found the net against Wolves, is another player who might be on his way out.",
      "Below the latest Manchester United transfer news....",
      "Just away from the transfer news for a second to announce Chelsea have agreed to part ways with Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day. The Italian took charge of 90 matches and last faced United in September when the Reds ran out 2-1 winners in a fiesty game at Old Trafford.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "In a statement on the United website, the Reds have explained why Collyer will be returning to Old Trafford. He has not played for West Brom since the end of November when he suffered an injury. United insist Collyer will come back to finish his recuperation and potentially offer Amorim another option in central midfield.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "West Brom have confirmed United have recalled Toby Collyer from his loan spell at the Hawthorns.",
      "More to come...",
      "The January transfer window is open for business and Manchester United approach it in a stronger position than in 2025. Ruben Amorim likely approached January 2025 with a sense of dread knowing the number of improvements needed for his squad to be able to play his system. To their credit, United did manage to complete a couple of deals. Ayden Heaven signed from Arsenal which raised a couple of eyebrows at the time but now appears to have been a great bit of business. Patrick Dorgu also arrived and he has shown glimpses of his potential since joining.",
      "Diego Leon signed a pre-contract agreement as United continued with their strategy of investing in young players to build for the future. It was not the spree the club needed, but it was relatively impressive all things considered.",
      "Read what a dream January could look like for United here>>>",
      "The biggest story of the month is likely to be Kobbie Mainoo, who wants to leave on loan to play regular football, having failed to start a Premier League game under Amorim this season. Napoli are keen to take the 20-year-old until the end of the season.",
      "Mainoo is due back from a calf injury shortly and his departure wouldn't be considered while Fernandes is out with a hamstring injury and Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim has made it clear he wants the academy graduate to stay and fight for his place and a loan move later in January might depend on whether the change in formation presents him with more opportunities and if Mainoo pushes to go. If he does, United might have to consider a move for a midfielder, although premium targets such as Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson will likely be out of reach in January.",
      "Read more here",
      "In an ideal world, Manchester United would have already started their January transfer window with a bang. They were one of several clubs that were keen to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth, and although that ship hasn't yet sailed, it is now looking unlikely.",
      "Semenyo is set to leave Bournemouth this month, and United would have paid his £65million release clause, but as it stands, it looks like Manchester City are set to win the battle for the 25-year-old. United were strongly in the race, however.",
      "Rather than focusing on a signing to strengthen the attack, this approach for Semenyo was for United to bring forward the pursuit of a long-term target because he was going to be on the move now. It is a theme which is set to condition their January window.",
      "Read more here",

      "Ruben Amorim is keen for Manchester United to strengthen their squad in January, but he has made the conditions of any deal clear. It's why this window may well pass without anything happening.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has readily talked about the \"mistakes\" of the past when it comes to recruitment and it's why he's keen to avoid any short-term deals this month if possible. The names of Odion Ighalo and Wout Weghorst spring to mind when considering January windows of the past.",
      "But there's no doubt United have put themselves in a position where it might be wise to roll the dice this month. They are firmly in the battle for a Champions League place next season, an outcome that could be crucial in accelerating their progress under Amorim.",
      "Their form hasn't always been convincing, but it's been good enough to show signs of improvement from last season and with inconsistencies clear beyond the top three of Arsenal, Manchester City and Aston Villa, there is an opportunity there.",
      "Speaking before United's defeat at Villa in December, Amorim said the club would try to do business this month, but that the focus would be on recruiting players who can have a long-term influence.",
      "\"We’ll see. The only thing that we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think that is going to be the future. It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that is more that we need more. We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that is part that they are perfect for our future.",
      "\"So I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",
      "When Amorim made those comments, it pointed towards a January move for Antoine Semenyo, whose £65million release clause at Bournemouth has made his mid-season exit a formality. United were keen on a deal but it looks like the 25-year-old is set for a move to Manchester City instead.",
      "The fact that United wanted to sign an attacker in Semenyo but had no alternative in that position explains their January strategy. This was an opportunity that presented itself, rather than fixing a desperate need within the squad.",
      "However, if there is an area that needs strengthening this month, it is in midfield, especially with Bruno Fernandes currently sidelined. There are question marks over the future of all of Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are keen to overhaul their midfield in the summer and will move for at least two new players, with Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson all of interest to them. There appears to be little chance of any coming this month, although Baleba has had a difficult campaign at Brighton.",
      "Instead, United's best approach in midfield might be looking at a more low-key signing, but still someone who will have a part to play beyond the end of this season. Ruben Neves could be available from Al-Hilal and they have monitored Bournemouth duo Tyler Adams and Alex Scott.",
      "With Casemiro out of contract in the summer, Mainoo struggling for minutes under Amorim, Ugarte falling out of favour and Fernandes making noises about his own future, it could yet turn into a year for a significant overhaul in central midfield, so making a start on that in January might be wise.",
      "There are likely to be exits this month as well. Joshua Zirkzee has featured in all of the last seven Premier League games, but he is struggling to make an impact and Roma are very keen on doing a deal for him. If that is either a permanent deal or includes an obligation to buy, then it makes sense, as it's hard to see the Dutchman surviving for much longer at Old Trafford.",
      "Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for United in 11 months on Boxing Day, but his days also appear to be numbered. The reversion to a back four could theoretically give him more opportunities, but Luke Shaw can play that role, as could Patrick Dorgu, while Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can fill in. Malacia was in the bomb squad in the summer and needs a move this month.",
      "Then there is Mainoo. The 20-year-old has suffered an untimely calf injury at a point when he might well have finally started a game this season. Amorim reverted to a three-man midfield against Newcastle and that opens up more chances for the academy graduate.",
      "Mainoo isn't expected to be out for long and Amorim has urged him to stay and fight for his place. However, Mainoo needs to play more football than the 212 Premier League minutes he has managed this season. His development has stalled while the likes of Baleba, Wharton and Anderson have surpassed him. The only way to change that is by playing.",
      "As unpalatable as it might be, if his fortunes don't change then he should be sent on loan in January. Napoli are keen to sign him and six months playing in a Serie A title race and in the Champions League, while being coached by Antonio Conte, could be a vital spell in his development.",

      "MEN Sport has taken a look at what a dream January 2026 transfer window could look like for United.",
      "The decision to sign Joshua Zirkzee continues to baffle. Zirkzee has always looked better in the No.10 role and even admitted when he arrived that he was not an out-and-out striker.",
      "The arrival of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha meant he was never likely to get a game as a No.10. Both new additions have proven to be better fits for United than Zirkzee and the decision to allow him to leave in the January transfer window needs to be taken for both his sake and the club's.",
      "Roma are understood to be keen and if that opportunity arises, it is only fair to allow him to depart.",
      "If Zirkzee leaves, United could do with a striker to replace him. The trouble here is the lack of centre-forwards available in general, never mind in the mid-season market.",
      "Brentford's Igor Thiago has caught the eye this season but considering the issues United had signing Mbeumo, it might be best to stay away from that one. Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta could be an option considering he knows the Premier League and Amorim's preferred formation.",
      "It's very unlikely to happen, but in a dream window for United it would. With 18 months left on his current deal, maybe United could test the waters.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's injury has put a pause on the conversation surrounding his exit. However, with the midfielder potentially being back soon, his future will once again be under the spotlight.",
      "Amorim has handled the situation well since Mainoo's brother decided to make his statement at Old Trafford. His message urging players to stay and fight for their place will have resonated with supporters and hopefully with the 20-year-old as well.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' recent comments suggest his future could be away from United so the hope will be for Mainoo to stay and to be prepared for his chance when it comes.",
      "Topping off what would be a perfect transfer window would be the addition of a central midfielder. United are clearly short and while a big midfield signing would be excellent in January, it is highly unlikely.",
      "One player who would strengthen the squad and could be available in January is Ruben Neves. The 28-year-old wants to leave Al Hilal when his contract expires at the end of this season so the Saudi club should be willing to do a deal in January.",
      "Neves would provide an immediate option for United in the centre and strengthen them not only for this season, but the next couple too.",

      "The start of a new year often leads to talk of fresh beginnings and for Manchester United supporters, they will be hoping 2026 is more like the last six months of 2025 rather than the start of it. United ended the 2024/25 season at a new low but have shown signs of improvement this campaign.",
      "Heading into the January transfer window, United do not need to make wholesale changes to their squad. If they go throughout the window without making any new additions, it would not be the worst possible scenario for Ruben Amorim and the club.",
      "However, there are a few situations which could unfold in the next few weeks which would prove to be a problem for United. MEN Sport has taken a look at what a nightmare January transfer window could look like for the Reds this winter.",
      "Due to his injury, Mainoo's future has been put to the backburner but it will undoubtedly reignite now the window is open and due to the potential for him to return to the squad at Leeds on Sunday. The nightmare scenario for United would be for Mainoo to request a loan move away from the club.",
      "Understandably, Mainoo wanted more games this season and his request to leave in the summer was easier to reject when the campaign was still young. If he were to request another loan move in January, it would put Amorim in a very difficult position.",
      "The United boss has urged Mainoo to stay and fight for his place. While this is an admirable position, sooner or later it becomes trickier to argue that staying is best when not too long ago, the midfielder was one of the hottest prospects in European football. Amorim's hand could easily be forced if Mainoo requests to leave again and this would be a nightmare for the Reds.",
      "While you could argue Amorim would be able to manage without Mainoo, it would be a bigger disaster if captain Bruno Fernandes were to speak out about his future too. The interview which aired in December did not spell good news for the Reds and Amorim downplayed it, making it clear how important Fernandes is both now and moving forward.",
      "If the Portuguese midfielder was to again hint at leaving United at the end of the season in January, coupled with Mainoo's request to leave, this would be a huge blow for the club. Amorim is already planning a major midfield overhaul for next summer if Fernandes and Mainoo stay. Should they not, that job becomes even trickier at the end of the season.",
      "Fernandes leaving in January is highly unlikely. However, United could still be forced into signings should their injury crisis worsen. This would be a nightmare for the Reds as it could open the door to transfers which are not in the long-term interests of the club.",
      "Amorim has been clear he only wants to sign players who can improve United in the future as well as now. Further injuries puts this plan on hold and throws a spanner in the works for the club.",

      "West Bromwich Albion have confirmed Manchester United have recalled Toby Collyer from his loan spell at The Hawthorns. The midfielder, who was handed his Premier League debut by Erik ten Hag, was loaned to the west midlands club to gain more experience of senior football.",
      "However, in a statement released by the Baggies, that switch has been cut short at the start of the January transfer window. Their statement reads: \"Toby Collyer has been recalled from his loan at The Hawthorns by parent club Manchester United. The 21-year-old midfielder made 12 appearances for the Baggies before sustaining a calf injury in the 1-1 draw against Birmingham City in November.",
      "\"Everyone at The Hawthorns wishes Toby well for his future career.\" The 21-year-old has not played for West Brom since the end of November and the reasoning behind the decision seems to be two-fold.",
      "Writing on their website, United explained: \"A highly rated talent with a tremendous work ethic, Toby returns to United to focus on his recovery and perhaps bolster Ruben Amorim’s options in midfield.\" Collyer was handed his Premier League debut at half time against Liverpool with the Reds struggling in the centre.",
      "Exactly when Collyer will return from his injury remains to be seen, but Amorim will be hopeful the midfielder could be back in contention sooner rather than later due to the midfield injury issues mounting at Old Trafford. Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are both currently unavailable due to injury.",
      "This has meant the makeshift partnership of Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro has been used to mixed results. Mason Mount is also an option but is currently out as well, and exactly when he shall return remains to be seen.",
      "In Collyer's absence, Amorim has called upon Jack Fletcher to bolster the midfield in recent games. Speaking to the media after the draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers, the United head coach insisted he was not going to risk players.",
      "\"I don't know. I have to check,\" Amorim replied when asked if any of the injured players would be back for the clash with Leeds on Sunday. \"I'm not going to risk anyone, to lose them for one month or two months.",
      "\"So, we'll try to arrange solutions. Again, let's see, and then we will try to win the next one with no risks for the players.\"",

      "The Stretford End had seen enough with just under 20 minutes of Manchester United's final game of 2025 to go. \"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the cry, urging more from a team treating the visit of a side with a shot at being the worst in Premier League history with all the trepidation of a Champions League knockout tie.",
      "Ruben Amorim's response was to turn to his bench - and bring Leny Yoro on for Ayden Heaven. That teenager Bendito Mantato came on at the same time didn't stop the home fans showing their frustration at another of those changes they have come to associate Amorim with.",
      "One centre-back for another when you're chasing the game, while attacking teenagers Shea Lacey and Chido Obi remained rooted to the bench, is the kind of safety-first move that is gradually eroding the faith many of these supporters have in Amorim. Having moved to a back-four on Boxing Day, the decision to revert to a back three against a team with two points from 18 games left many scratching their heads.",
      "It allowed Wolves to settle into the game. United started quickly on Boxing Day, but approached the start of this game as if they had a belly full of mince pies and chocolates. It's so often the way in a defensive system and it felt as if Amorim hadn't learnt his lesson.",
      "It's only a couple of weeks since Paul Scholes said Amorim didn't get Manchester United. This is the kind of night that makes you think he might just be on to something. They have improved this season, but the football can be slow and uninspiring. Amorim will point to the injuries. His critics will point to the level of opposition.",
      "Even the goal they got owed plenty to a big slice of fortune. It was a year to the day since Joshua Zirkzee was replaced after just 33 minutes of an Old Trafford defeat to Newcastle, with the ironic cheers that greeted his number going up the kind of moment that can kill a player's confidence. The Dutchman has shown character in recovering from that, but not the quality that suggests his stay at this club will last much longer.",
      "This time, he lasted 45 minutes and even managed a goal, but it was the kind of night that showed why Amorim is running out of patience with him. His goal was a scuffed shot that deflected in off Ladislav Krejci, but beyond that it was another casual performance that suggested he is a fish out of water in a team that wants to play with any kind of physicality and tempo.",
      "Amorim was on his case from the start. He had called for an improvement in Zirkzee's approach to duels before kick-off, but none was forthcoming. The 24-year-old used the outside of his foot more than the inside, offering fancy flicks around the corner to try and link with Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, but when it came to getting his hands dirty, he didn't want to know.",
      "The goal actually owed more to a tone-setting challenge from Ayden Heaven, who stole the ball from Hwang Hee-chan and drove forward towards the edge of the box. It was one of the few positive pieces of play United produced in a dire first half.",
      "Sesko fashioned a chance for himself out of nothing and then hit the post with a header from a corner, but Wolves were the better team. Senne Lammens was alert to save from Hugo Bueno, but then saw Krejci's header from a corner inadvertently flicked on by Zirkzee arrow past him.",
      "It was following a similar pattern to the game at Molineux three weeks ago, when Wolves also equalised just before half-time. That came out of nothing, whereas at Old Trafford it was the least they deserved. It also lacked the second-half onslaught United delivered in the Midlands.",
      "If you were being charitable, you could say Wolves had improved since that defeat, but they had still lost every game. They almost dished out some charity of their own when Yerson Mosquera headed past his own goalkeeper, only for Jose Sa to claw the ball on the line.",
      "United needed their own goalkeeper to come to the rescue soon after, Lammens brilliantly saving from Krejci and then getting up to claw the ball away from danger. Diogo Dalot chucked himself in front of a shot from Jhon Arias to deflect it behind for a corner.",
      "For all the huffing and puffing, United's own attacks lacked quality. Too often, they don't get enough men forward. They briefly thought they had won it when Patrick Dorgu slammed in after Sa saved Sesko's shot, but he was marginally offside. It summed up a night of frustration.",
      "The final whistle was greeted by jeers and dropped points against Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves in four of their last five games at Old Trafford are going to prove costly. The away end celebrated with chants of \"we've got a point\", and that might be the ultimate humiliation for United.",

      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo was taken off at half-time as Cameroon beat Mozambique 2-1 to secure their place in the last-16 of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Despite fears the 26-year-old could be injured, it's believed the decision was merely a tactical one to avoid suspension.",
      "Cameroon were level at half-time - as Geny Catamo's opener for Mozambique was cancelled out by a Nene own goal. Christian Kofane would win the game for his nation in the second half, but Mbeumo was not on the pitch to influence proceedings.",
      "He was replaced at half-time along with United-linked midfielder Carlos Baleba in what was thought to be a bid to avoid the pair being suspended for the last-16 clash with South Africa. Both stars had picked up yellow cards in the group stages, with Mbeumo being booked in the opening fixture against Gabon.",
      "Had either man received another booking against Mozambique, they would have been suspended for the last-16. Mbeumo's early farewell from the game on New Year's Eve comes as the United star struggles for form at AFCON this winter. Despite registering an assist against Gabon, Mbeumo has had no goal involvements since.",
      "Before the Mozambique game, Cameroon head coach David Pagou admitted Mbeumo was, potentially, putting too much pressure on himself to succeed. \"He's putting too much pressure on himself, but I think he will manage that,\" Pagou explained.",
      "\"He's a great footballer, a great player, even for this country.",
      "\"He loves this team and really wants to commit to being ‌as effective as possible.",
      "\"So today, again, in our little chat with him, the desire is there to be present, to ⁠step up, and to do great things.\"",
      "Pagou added: \"Bryan is a player who loves freedom; he has those qualities.",
      "\"So we are not going to deprive him of that and stop him from expressing himself on the pitch the way he wants.",
      "\"It's intentional we let him express himself across the whole field. It's true he's ⁠had some difficulties flourishing.\"",
      "With Cameroon advancing at AFCON, the earliest that Mbeumo will now be released back to United is Monday, January 5 - should his nation lose to South Africa on Sunday. Cameroon's progression means all three of United's AFCON stars have made it to the knockout stages.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui's Morocco are hosting the tournament and they will take on Tanzania in the last-16 on Sunday.",
      "As for Amad's Ivory Coast, they managed to top a group which featured Cameroon.",
      "Their 3-2 win over Gabon has ensured they have a couple of days extra rest, too, before they play Burkina Faso in the last-16 on Tuesday.",

      "Manchester United academy graduate Jesse Lingard insists he deserved to play following his loan spell at West Ham and has suggested his persona has been misconstrued over the years. Lingard came through the United system as a child and went on to make 232 appearances for the Reds.",
      "However, the opportunities for Lingard dried up and in the 2020/21 January transfer window he joined West Ham on loan. During that spell at the London Stadium, Lingard scored an impressive nine goals in 16 matches while registering five assists in the process.",
      "Unfortunately for the midfielder, when he returned to Old Trafford the following season he played just 16 Premier League matches in the entire year. When his contract expired in 2022, he left to join Nottingham Forest but that lasted just one season as injury struggles and poor form halted his momentum.",
      "\"Obviously I had different managers and different managers are going to play you or not play you - it is understandable. As a player you want to play every game so obviously I wanted to play.",
      "\"I feel like after the West Ham loan spell that season, coming back, I felt like I deserved to play. I was probably one of the best players in the league at West Ham, at the time. I probably deserved to go to the Euros, in fairness.",
      "\"But like I say, everything happens for a reason and to come back and play a part bit here, a part bit there - you want to play every game. Sometimes you know when your time is up and you know when it is time to leave.\"",
      "One of the main criticisms levelled at Lingard over the years has been his professionalism. Gary Neville was quoted in 2019 suggesting the midfielder looked 'a bit of a prat' after dancing on social media while the Reds were struggling.",
      "But Lingard has defended himself against the suggestion he messes about. \"In life, in general, outside football, inside football, there is always going to be tough times mentally when you are not playing well and you are getting stick from fans,\" he explained.",
      "\"Sometimes you have to go through that and learn and I have learnt through all of that and now I am at a point where I don’t care what anyone says, I don’t care what anyone thinks - at the end of the day they are just words. I don’t listen to any negative stuff.",
      "\"The majority of the stuff is positive and everyone I have met since being in Manchester has been positive so, for me, I like to be a good guy, put smiles on people’s faces, be the bubbly guy but when it is time to work, I work. I think that’s been misconstrued over the years because people think he messes about a lot and stuff.",
      "\"They say he is always dancing, of course I am going to dance - I love a good dance in the right place and the right time. But when I am on the training pitch and on a game day, it is 100% work mode.\"",
      "Lingard still keeps a close eye on United and has backed Ruben Amorim's side to compete for the top-four this season. Lingard said: \"They have a solid manager with really good ideas so y’know I can’t see why they cannot push for the Champions League this year.",
      "\"With a manager like Amorim they can stick with him. I know sometimes they don’t win games and you are always going to learn but he is the type of manager who doesn’t care what the media say or anyone around him. He wants to concentrate on Manchester United.\"",

      "Turkish club Kayserispor have submitted a fresh bid to sign Manchester United youngster Sam Mather on a permanent deal. Mather was in talks to join Kayserispor in the summer transfer window, but the deal collapsed.",
      "Kayserispor would like to wrap up a quick deal for Mather in order for him to join their mid-season winter training camp next week. United are willing to make concessions to allow Mather to leave as early as possible after his summer move collapsed.",
      "The MEN reported in September that talks were at an advanced stage with Kayserispor on Turkey's deadline day. Kayserispor pushed hard to sign Mather on a permanent deal. The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward.",
      "United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather has outgrown academy football and is hungry to leave his boyhood club to further his career. He has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role. His contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027.",

      "Manchester United shared the points in a 1-1 draw with Wolves in the Premier League on Tuesday night. United took the lead in the 27th minute through a heavily deflected Joshua Zirkzee effort, but Wolves drew level on the stroke of half-time thanks to a headed goal from defender Ladislav Krejci.",
      "Rob Edwards had not won a single point since his appointment as Wolves boss at the beginning of November, but the 43-year-old oversaw a draw against United.",
      "Here are the talking points from the draw and the moments you might have missed:",
      "Sarcastic cheers for Zirkzee",
      "There was a smattering of sarcastic cheers from the Stretford End when it was announced that Zirkzee had been replaced by Jack Fletcher for the second half of the game.",
      "Zirkzee was responsible for the opening goal of the match, but he also had a hand in the Wolves' equaliser, which is partly why some United fans were happy to see him brought off.",
      "Amorim hooked Zirkzee in favour of giving Fletcher his third senior appearance. Zirkzee is keen to leave in the January window for the sake of regular starts, and he may be granted his wish.",
      "It was time last year that Zirkzee was booed by his own fans after being hooked in the 33rd minute against Newcastle. The reaction against Wolves wasn't as bad, but the smattering of sarcastic cheers proves that he has failed to convince matchgoing fans since his arrival from Bologna.",
      "Where was the anger?",
      "The reaction - or lack of - from United's players to Krejci's equalising goal was fascinating, as they trudged back to the halfway line without saying a word to each other.",
      "Casemiro scooped the ball out of the net and kicked it away in frustration, but there was no inquest amongst the red shirts to determine how the Premier League's worst side had scored.",
      "The lack of a response was the kind of thing that Roy Keane would slam if he were on punditry duty. Where was the leadership among a group of senior players?",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost certainly would have led an inquest if he had been on the pitch.",
      "The sluggish start",
      "Amorim has regularly spoken about the importance of starting well at Old Trafford because coming out of the traps quickly whips up the crowd and helps to create an intimidating atmosphere.",
      "United's players looked like they had eaten too much turkey and Christmas pudding in the opening exchanges against Wolves, though. Amorim was not happy with the sluggish start and became increasingly frustrated on the touchline, waving his arms in an attempt to encourage quicker play from the back.",
      "The crowd went flat due to the pedestrian pace. \"Is this the Etihad?\" the Wolves fans taunted, which was followed by a rendition of \"You're just a ground full of tourists.\"",
      "It was understandable that Old Trafford was not at its loudest. Wolves rocked up in Manchester with two points, but they looked like the better side, running harder and winning second balls.",
      "The arm around Sesko",
      "Sesko created an opportunity for himself in the first half thanks to some brilliant centre-forward play, shrugging off his marker before fashioning a yard in space in the box and pulling the trigger. The shot was fired inches wide of the post, and Sesko hit the woodwork shortly after that.",
      "The Slovenia international rose highest from a corner, but his header smacked against the post. He looked to the ground, wondering what more he had to do, and Diogo Dalot put his arm around him.",
      "Dalot looked to be telling his teammate to keep going. Sesko heeded that advice and continued to get himself in dangerous areas, but his inexperience was evident again when he sent a simple header wide following a clever lofted ball over the top from Casemiro.",
      "It would be more concerning if Sesko wasn't getting into promising positions to score. Nonetheless, his finishing must sharpen to fire United into the Champions League places this season.",
      "Happy with Heaven",
      "United simply could not get going in the opening 20 minutes against Wolves, so it was not a surprise to see fans celebrate a moment of aggression from Ayden Heaven as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Heaven made an outstanding tackle to dispossess Hwang Hee-chan and pockets of fans around the press box rose to their feet to applaud. And they were standing again just 10 seconds later.",
      "Heaven drove with the ball and found Zirkzee around the box. The Dutchman found the back of the net thanks to a heavy deflection, but it was Heaven that deserved all the credit for the goal.",
      "The crowd's reaction to Heaven's tackle was telling. It was the first time in the game that a United player had shown some fight, and it proved to be a catalyst to break the deadlock.",

      "Ruben Amorim said the decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half-time of Manchester United's draw with Wolves was because his side were struggling to gain control of the midfield. Zirkzee scored United's goal via a deflection but the visitors were the better side before the break, despite failing to win a single Premier League game this season.",
      "Zirkzee was replaced at half-time by teenager Jack Fletcher. Amorim confirmed the decision was tactical and he felt it paid off, with his team better able to win possession back in the second half, although they continued to struggle for creativity.",
      "\"We need to do what the game was asking. They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" said Amorim. \"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Despite that, Amorim only turned to academy debutant Bendito Mantato and centre-back Leny Yoro after the break. He ignored the attacking options of Shea Lacey and Chido Obi on the bench despite United desperately needing a goal to earn the victory.",
      "The 40-year-old defended that decision and said the circumstances weren't right to throw too many youngsters on, with eight first-team players missing and his team struggling for fluidity. \"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid. You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\"",

      "Heaven has made several appearances across all competitions this term and has featured in the last five league matches. That run includes a standout performance in their recent narrow win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day.",
      "Lineker, an England legend who represented the likes of Leicester City, Barcelona and Everton during his playing days, has offered some insight into the team supporting Heaven’s development at Old Trafford. Lineker is represented by long-standing agent Jon Holmes, who works alongside one of Heaven’s representatives, Andy May.",
      "\"We have the same agent,\" Lineker revealed on this week's The Rest is Football podcast. \"Andy [May] looks after him.",
      "\"He's in good hands. He came to Ballers League with me last season. He's a nice lad.\"",
      "Alongside May, Heaven is also represented by his mother, Lisa, and both played a significant role in securing his move from Arsenal to United earlier this year. \"Delighted to have assisted Ayden Heaven with his transfer from Arsenal to Manchester United, alongside Karim Bouzidi and Lisa Heaven,\" May shared in a social media post back in February.",
      "\"It has been a pleasure during the past couple of years to witness Ayden’s development as a footballer and person. This significant move, and the confidence shown in him by his new club, is a testament to his talent, dedication, and ambition.\"",
      "Heaven's recent performance against Newcastle was the latest example of his continued development and impressed the pundits watching on. Former Manchester City star Micah Richards, in particular, feels the youngster has all the tools to become a top defender.",
      "\"He reads the game really well for a young player,\" he chimed in, also speaking on the Rest is Football podcast. \"Physically, he can deal with it and he's strong enough.",
      "\"He's quick enough. But he reads the game well, and for a young player to read the game like that [is fantastic]. I thought it was a really good performance from him, and they needed him because of [the injuries].\"",

      "When Patrick Dorgu was racing around the Old Trafford pitch on Boxing Day, demanding the ball at every opportunity and determined to be involved in the game as often as possible, he didn't look like the player Ruben Amorim had been talking about four weeks earlier.",
      "At the end of November, Amorim discussed the pressure on Dorgu to perform and how it can consume young players at Manchester United. He is only 21 and yet to hit 40 appearances for the club, but doubts were beginning to form around the £25million January signing.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said back then. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton.",
      "\"That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Sources close to the player insist he hadn't been flustered by Amorim's comments, retaining a sense of confidence that he had what it takes to succeed at United. His self-belief had grown from the January window last year, not just from signing for United, but also from being wanted by several clubs, with Antonio Conte also keen to sign him for eventual Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "He has done extra training since being left out of the team following that defeat to Everton and feels that put him in a position to hit the ground running when his opportunity came around again.",
      "On Boxing Day, Dorgu's tally of 58 touches in the game was second only to Manuel Ugarte's 63 for United and you could visibly sense his confidence growing after his stunning strike had given Amorim's team the lead.",
      "He joked that he didn't know he could do that after the match, and as he watched the ball fall from the sky on the edge of the area, it would have been easy for him to think back to some wayward shots earlier in his United career. He had tried 30 shots without scoring, but it proved to be worth the wait.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Amorim discuss Dorgu after the game and explain how his position as a right winger might have helped to free him up and ease the defensive nerves.",
      "\"Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball,\" said Amorim. \"He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "There is plenty of sense in that, although it wasn't a one-off for Dorgu. Returning to the team as a left wing-back against Aston Villa, he produced one of his best displays in that position as well. His reading of the game and tenacity set up Matheus Cunha's goal, and delivered an excellent cross, which created another big chance for the Brazilian.",
      "When he joined from Lecce in January, director of football Jason Wilcox talked up Dorgu's versatility and he can play on either flank, but if Amorim sticks with a 4-3-3 for now, then he could make the right-wing spot his own for a few weeks, with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Maybe a run of games there, freed up of some responsibility, will help the Dane settle into life a little more at Old Trafford. He deserves credit for fighting back in the last two games after Amorim's November comments and now has the chance to really kickstart his United career.",

      "Manchester United teenage defender Ayden Heaven will not be switching international allegiances from England to Ghana, according to reports this week.",
      "The 19-year-old, formerly of Arsenal, signed for the Red Devils for a nominal fee at the start of the year and made a handful of senior appearances towards the tail end of last season. He made his first-team debut in March in a Europa League clash against Real Sociedad.",
      "This term, Heaven has made several Premier League appearances, five of which have been starts. He recently played the full 90 minutes in a narrow defeat against Aston Villa, and featured against Newcastle on Boxing Day, where he was named the Premier League Player of the Match as Amorim's side kept a rare clean sheet.",
      "So far, the teenager has represented England at various youth levels and earned his first call-up to the Under-20s side in the autumn. He was not selected for the November international break due to injury, but is likely to be included in one of the squads when international football resumes in the spring.",
      "Despite being born in London, Heaven also qualifies to represent Ghana through a grandparent, and his development has understandably been monitored. Under current FIFA rules, players can switch national teams provided they have played no more than three competitive senior games before the age of 21, have not featured in the latter stages of an international tournament and as long as three years have passed since their last senior appearance.",
      "According to the BBC, Heaven will not be switching allegiances to represent Ghana, with the World Cup fast approaching. Although Ghana did not qualify for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, they did book their place at next summer's tournament in the United States and have been drawn in a group with England, Croatia and Panama.",
      "The article notes that Heaven wants to represent England at senior level and force his way into the first-team squad, a feat he will surely achieve so long as he continues on an upward trajectory at United.",
      "Heaven has earned the praise of manager Ruben Amorim this season, with the Portuguese coach highlighting the youngster's attitude and application in training. \"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" he told the media recently.",
      "\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you can feel that he has a good game, slows the thinking and improves during the game.",
      "\"He trained really well. If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "United return to action on Tuesday night with their final match of 2025 at home against Wolves. They will then start the new year with an away trip to Leeds this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There were plaudits aplenty for Manchester United players on Boxing Day, particularly the defenders who had managed to dig in and preserve a backs-to-the-wall clean sheet that secured a 1-0 win against Newcastle. It was a win that temporarily moved them up to fifth and showed a different side to their game.",
      "United had just 24% possession in the second half and had to do plenty of defending, with Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez excellent. However, throughout the siege, there was a sense of calm that isn't always associated with Ruben Amorim's side, particularly when under pressure.",
      "The return of Martinez might have helped in that regard, but 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has also had an impact, even if his statistics aren't yet making that clear after his £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp. This was just Lammens' second clean sheet in 12 games.",
      "His celebrations at the end showed he was desperate to get the shut-out and although he didn't have to make any outstanding saves, he was secure in goal. There was one excellent claim under a high ball in injury time that relieved the pressure and earned him a pat on the back from teammates.",
      "It was hard to imagine United defending with the poise they did had a different goalkeeper been behind the defence. Andre Onana's form fell apart at Old Trafford and his inconsistency too often spread panic and uncertainty to his teammates. Altay Bayindir has had his moments, but has shown vulnerabilities under the high ball.",
      "Lammens is still learning as a goalkeeper and has just 106 senior appearances to his name, with only 55 of those in Belgium's Pro League before his move to United. It was a signing based on potential, but he has faced little competition in goal, and the improvement when he plays is clearer in the way his teammates have reacted to him than in the saves he has made.",
      "That is something one of United's greatest ever goalkeepers has noticed. Speaking before the Newcastle game, Peter Schmeichel was full of praise for Lammens.",
      "\"He's only 23 years old, he's come in and there's calm at the back four, there's not this chaos where they don't want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man,\" Schmeichel told Viaplay.",
      "\"And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he's not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.",
      "\"I don't think he pays too much attention to the results of the goals he conceded. I think he's living a dream and everyday he comes in and he wants to learn and he wants to improve and I think he's done really well.\"",
      "That calmness was a trait noted by Boxing Day matchwinner Patrick Dorgu. “I think he helped with his calmness,\" he said. “He’s very calm and he’s talking a lot to the defenders and helping everyone on the pitch with his communication.",
      "“He’s just calm and he tries to take responsibility to help us defenders as well. He came in well and he’s doing really well, so he just needs to keep going.”",
      "Lammens is yet to make an error leading to a goal this season and, as Schmeichel touched on, he is happy to go long with his kicking when required. The sound of Old Trafford getting agitated as United try and fail to play out from the back has gone, with their new No.1 better at picking his moments to go short.",
      "It hasn't been a faultless start, and Lammens would have expected to do better with a couple of Bournemouth's goals in the 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this month, but he is still inexperienced for the role he is now fulfilling and there has been plenty more in the positive column in his first few months at the club.",

      "Much has been made of Ruben Amorim's view of the Manchester United academy in recent days. It was only earlier this month when the United boss was having to defend his selection and reasoning behind overlooking the potential of youth.",
      "That changed at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night with United naming five academy graduates on the bench and bringing two of them one. Tyler Fredricson was given the final few minutes as the Reds saw out a 1-0 victory while Jack Fletcher played the second half in place of the injured Mason Mount.",
      "It was a show of faith from Amorim in Fletcher given the manager could have called upon Joshua Zirkzee to fill the second striker role. But the Dutchman was introduced off the bench, just as he had been at Villa Park a few days prior.",
      "United had impressed in the first half with Patrick Dorgu's fine goal the difference at the interval but the Reds were forced to defend deep in the second period to see out the contest, meaning Fletcher didn't get on the ball as much as he would have liked. But after adjusting to the pace of the contest, the 18-year-old didn't look out of place in senior football.",
      "“I think it might take a while to adjust to the tempo and intensity,\" said Fletcher after the game. \"It was really tough out there, heavy on the legs, 45 minutes of defending, I think we did well. Hopefully, I can showcase my talent more.”",
      "His showing will provide food for thought for United, who will be looking to strengthen their midfield given the likely departure of Casemiro at the end of the season. There are question marks over Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future while Manuel Ugarte has struggled to make his mark since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher, son of former United man Darren, has a bright future ahead of him and is likely to gain more minutes over the coming weeks. He might not be ready for the rough and tumble of top flight football every week just yet, but the experiences over the next few months could mean he's ready sooner rather than later. Amorim has made a point of not promoting academy talents the sake of it, so when one does come into the fray it's all the more impressive.",
      "\"Jack did a very good job,\" said Amorim of Fletcher. \"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has made a strong impression during his loan spell at Barcelona, with the majority of the Catalan club's supporters keen for him to be signed on a permanent basis next summer, according to a poll conducted by a Spanish media outlet.",
      "Rashford moved to the La Liga heavyweights in the summer, with United and Barca agreeing on a deal that includes an option for the Spanish club to make the move permanent at the end of the season. To retain Rashford beyond May 2026, Barca would need to fork out approximately £26 million.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under manager Hansi Flick. His impressive form has put him in the running for an England call-up for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Reports from Spain suggest that Flick is eager to keep Rashford at the club and efforts are underway to secure a deal.",
      "A poll conducted by Mundo Deportivo revealed that 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would support the club in exercising the purchase option in Rashford's loan deal. A small fraction, 6.3 per cent, believe that sporting director Deco should wait until the end of the season before making a decision.",
      "This leaves nearly 40 per cent of fans opposed to the idea of signing Rashford on a permanent basis.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Rashford himself seems to be enjoying life at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy graduate has spoken about his future aspirations with the club.",
      "In an interview with SPORT, he said: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.",
      "\"For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies. Last season was fantastic, but in life, everything happens very quickly, things change, and the goal is to repeat the successes. I'm totally focused on this.",

      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",
      "During his Christmas break whilst La Liga paused for winter, Rashford distributed gifts to youngsters at two Barcelona Foundation centres. The striker revealed: \"I grew up in this type of environment.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",

      "“It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all.

      "“From what I hear, the plan is to sell him and then use that money elsewhere.",
      "“It’s risky and in my opinion is stupid, because you’re not going to get a better player than Bruno Fernandes so it will be a downgrade, but that’s their idea.",

      "Enzo Maresca rocking up at Newcastle, with Frank Lampard replacing him at Chelsea, has been forecasted for a 2026 which will end with Arsenal as champions.",
      "Our predictions for football in 2025 were roundly awful so don’t panic too much about these.",
      "",
      "A temporary ceasefire was called in time for Liverpool to put together a season-stabilising seven-game unbeaten run, with Salah able to properly concentrate on helping finally deliver AFCON glory for Egypt.",
      "The 33-year-old has managed to steer clear of those enticing mixed zones in Morocco, even after taking his nation to the last 16 by scoring two of their three goals so far.",
      "That hour-long return against Brighton was pitched in some quarters as a sort of farewell and uncertainty does linger over precisely what the future holds for Salah, but a winter exit no longer seems an inevitability.",
      "The point does, however, remain that a separation likely suits both parties after almost a decade together. Salah cannot really accept a lesser role on the biggest wage at a club which has not outgrown one of their greatest ever scorers and players, but is attempting to move away from his attacking autonomy.",
      "",
      "It seems a bold call to make about one of the Premier League’s form sides, a manager and squad which navigated unbeaten a hazardous December path through five opponents currently placed 11th or above.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin also literally cannot stop scoring; at this point it is ruining the lives of his family and friends.",
      "But is this formation, approach and attitude change really sustainable enough to carry Leeds and Daniel Farke through the next few months? And is a six-point gap so substantial as to sufficiently safeguard them from the drop?",
      "This might be the new normal for Leeds and Calvert-Lewin – and there is a point to be made about whether West Ham and Nottingham Forest can generate enough vague competence to punish any slips either way – but the history of this club and coach does suggest a reversion to the mean is impending.",
      "",
      "Feel like pure shit, just want the inherent managerial precariousness of the 2022/23 season back.",
      "It was perhaps the greatest time to be alive, when a ludicrous number of clubs panicked to the absurd extent that it ended with Sam Allardyce, Dean Smith, Ruben Selles and Ryan Mason in gainful employment.",
      "The best part was in how some of those fearful teams reacted by not necessarily drunkenly calling their ex, but instead skipping back a few relationships to land on someone they were with a couple of decades ago and who has moved on and settled down with someone else since.",
      "Leicester literally considered reappointing Martin O’Neill and only the daftest of footballing institutions would consider such a thing in the 2020s.",
      "There is a sense building that we could see something similar soon. Our favourite picks? Roy Hodgson rocking back up at Crystal Palace in a post-Glasner haze; West Ham bringing Slaven Bilic back to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who embraces another Championship promotion push at Wolves; Mauricio Pochettino falling into the Spurs job after the World Cup; and Nottingham Forest realising they have sacked everyone before deciding to go around again, starting with Steve Cooper.",
      "Oh, and obviously Jurgen Klopp: Liverpool caretaker manager.",
      "",
      "One of the likelier examples of a mistakenly rekindled relationship might well emanate from West London. It’s not like Chelsea and Frank Lampard haven’t accidentally fallen back into bed with each other before.",
      "That 11-game, single-win interim spell from April to May 2023, in which a bar systematically lowered by Graham Potter was dragged towards the core of the actual Earth by a shell-shocked Lampard purely because Todd Boehly wanted to make Mediawatch look stupid, should never be forgotten.",
      "Both club and manager have changed since. Although Chelsea haven’t really, considering Enzo Maresca is on the brink of leaving in the middle of a season the Blues started by being crowned world champions, purely because he made a comment he simply does not want to properly clarify and would instead prefer to continue digging a hole directly out of Stamford Bridge.",
      "Lampard certainly seems to have grown from his most recent experiences at Chelsea. He has guided Frank Lampard’s Coventry City to the top of the Championship with promotion in their hands. But it was ultimately only ever a rebound and one agitated call from Boehly in October will be enough to end that beautiful union.",
      "",
      "It will be interesting to see what Chelsea’s succession plan consists of, considering Maresca has more than three years left on his contract and has, for all intents and purposes, felt forced out despite being precisely the sort of malleable coach the Blues seemed to want post-Pochettino.",
      "Perhaps Champions League qualification and a couple of trophies strengthened Maresca’s character and resolve to the extent he started developing ideas above his station. And maybe a hierarchy whose football acumen remains under intense scrutiny is going to be appointing a fifth manager in three and a half years of ownership soon.",
      "Maresca has his faults but can walk with his head held high into most jobs as a result of his work. Eddie Howe is approaching what feels like the end of his Newcastle road, and would provide compelling testimony to how much more control the Italian might expect to exert on Tyneside than at Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "The long-running joke is that ‘only Salah’ was once a ubiquitous preface to most football stats. It appears to have been usurped by ‘only Haaland’, but also specifically for stats involving, well, only Haaland.",
      "For example, only Haaland (in 2022/23) has ever scored more goals before the turn of the year in a Premier League season than his tally so far in 2025/26. He is competing with himself at this stage.",
      "And halfway through the campaign, he is more than halfway to matching his record of 36 for most goals in a Premier League season. With his longest drought in 2025/26 to this point lasting two matches, only Haaland seems to be in the mood.",
      "",
      "But performative passive-aggressive praise is draining and four years of nitpicking Haaland’s latest hat-trick has taken an inevitable toll on Guardiola.",
      "The outlook is far brighter than this time last year, when the entire project seemed to be unravelling at a rate even 115 upheld charges would struggle to match. That run of one win in 13 games was brutal.",
      "Guardiola withstood that, even signing a contract extension towards the start of it, to oversee a new Manchester City chapter which doesn’t half resemble the last in terms of putting together ridiculous winning runs which no-one notices until it’s too late.",
      "That really must be exhausting, however, and recent speculation over his future might build to a crescendo of his departure after a decent enough decade.",
      "",
      "Having already declared he “would do 75% of things different” if given another go at his first year in charge of Manchester United, it was entertaining to see Amorim revert to his old ways as soon as the apparent gimme of a home game against Wolves presented itself.",
      "That he and Manchester United made a hash of even drawing with one of the worst teams in Premier League history only added to the dark comedic undertones.",
      "There has been undoubted progress for a club eyeing the Champions League rather than the Championship, but there will come a time when those in charge of the decisions at Manchester United start to wonder whether this was all worth it or indeed the only viable route back.",
      "They are fully invested in Amorim and willing to forgive his faults, seemingly at least in part because he himself speaks so candidly about them while Jason Wilcox and friends maintain a vow of silence.",
      "Amorim, in the meantime, will continue to hone his Solskjaer-esque knack of spacing out his wins and defeats perfectly to keep the boom-bust cycle going.",
      "",
      "For a more specific prediction, we go to Tuchel himself:",
      "“I think we all understand that when it comes to knockout football it’s: ‘How do we go out?’. It’s different if we lose 3-0 in a round of 32 to a huge underdog and we completely underperform, or you lose with a red card in the second minute for the goalkeeper and you go out and you put up a big fight in a quarter-final and you go out on penalties and play 120 minutes with 10 men.”",
      "Perfect. A brave, valiant shoot-out defeat to Brazil in the last eight after coasting through the groups and past Mexico it is.",
      "Tuchel has proven to be a very good England manager, negotiating the myriad issues it presents and growing into the role with impressive authority. But he knows as well as anyone how fickle tournament football can be, even if he has already shown that this is a short-term arrangement which ought to be extended.",
      "",
      "Their standing at the top of both tables heading into the new year should not be too heavily emphasised; Liverpool enjoyed such a command this time last season but were then immediately eliminated from the Champions League by eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "There was even a mild wobble or two in the Premier League and domestic cups but the Reds were deserved champions long before the end.",
      "Some but obviously not all of that was ultimately down to the lack of a competent challenger, as Arsenal themselves continued to trip over their own feet while everyone else imploded.",
      "Arsenal will be kept honest by Manchester City until the very end in the Premier League, and there is little point forecasting their journey in Europe.",
      "But this is a wildly strong squad and increasingly mature coach, both of whom have sustained enough blows and learned the requisite lessons to start pulling through when it matters.",
      "And predicting Arsenal will win both the Premier and Champions League in 2026 does make it far easier to accuse them of bottling when they don’t accomplish something few teams ever have.",
      "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is reportedly ready to leave Stamford Bridge with a former Hull City boss one of the favourites to take over.",
      "Enzo Maresca is likely to be sacked on Thursday as Chelsea hold ’emergency talks’ over the Italian’s future at Stamford Bridge, according to reports.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed a concrete update on head coach Enzo Maresca’s future at Chelsea as the internal “feeling is not good”.",
      "‘All signs’ at Chelsea are reportedly ‘pointing clearly towards’ head coach Enzo Maresca leaving next year and his exit could occur before the summer."

      "This year’s January transfer window is already shaping up to surpass last season’s equivalent, with Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo emerging as the early favourite to be the most expensive signing as a £65m deal nears.",
      "There have also been murmurs of Arsenal and Manchester United doing business if the right opportunities arise, while Spurs are also likely to be active as they are set to recoup £35m after ‘agreeing’ a deal to sell Brennan Johnson, who also has other options, to Crystal Palace.",
      "This will see Tottenham accept a £15m loss on Johnson, who joined the north London outfit via the Harry Kane money as a £50m signing to fill the huge void left by the Bayern Munich superstar.",
      "Johnson overcame an uninspiring debut season to star in Tottenham’s Europa League triumph by scoring some vital goals, but the Welshman, like Dominic Solanke, has been derailed by the summer appointment of Thomas Frank, who has preferred other attackers.",
      "So, with Johnson retaining most of his value but lacking minutes, he is the most obvious candidate to be sold to fund Tottenham’s moves in January and next summer, while the player can benefit from being a bigger fish at a very reputable Premier League club. Really, everybody wins.",
      "And this got us thinking. Theoretically, if the remaining Big Six sides also had to pick one player bought for £50m+ within the last three years to cut ties with to finance their next lot of signings, who would they choose and why? From Arsenal to Manchester United, here is what they should do in this scenario…",
      "",
      "It’s just not working, is it?",
      "Gyokeres was billed as Arsenal’s final piece of the jigsaw when he was supposedly bought to fix Mikel Arteta’s striker problem in the summer, but they are arguably in the same boat as they were without the Swedish international.",
      "The 27-year-old bulldozer scored at a ridiculous rate over two years for Sporting Lisbon, but the Premier League is a completely different level and he has been found out this term.",
      "His tally of five goals in 17 Premier League games is not disastrous on paper, but two of these goals have been penalties and he has only scored once in his last seven outings.",
      "Gyokeres is a different profile from Arsenal’s other strikers, and he is certainly the best finisher inside the box, but he has offered next to nothing in general play and Gabriel Jesus has looked far brighter when replacing him in recent weeks. This will likely also be the case once Kai Havertz is back up to speed.",
      "Arsenal made the biggest statement in the title race so far on Tuesday night by brushing in-form Aston Villa aside to win 4-1, but Gyokeres was the noticeable weak link before he was replaced. He could feasibly end this season as Arteta’s third-choice striker, so the north London outfit would be astute to cut ties before his value declines even further.",
      "READ: Premier League managers of 2025 as Mikel Arteta nudged up one place",
      "",
      "A major hallmark of Todd Boehly’s reign at Stamford Bridge has been Chelsea’s unrelenting insistence on hoarding up-and-coming wingers and ignoring other positions in desperate need of upgrades: a new goalkeeper, centre-back and striker.",
      "This continued in the summer as the Blues brought in Gittens, Estevao and Alejandro Garnacho to fill the squad spots previously occupied by Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke.",
      "In fairness to Chelsea, it is at least the case that the latest batch of wingers are upgrades on last season’s options, but Estevao and Garnacho have certainly outshone Gittens.",
      "Estevao could become something quite special, though it appears that Garnacho also has a higher ceiling than Gittens, who is much further from being the final product than his two teammates, despite being in a similar age bracket.",
      "Chelsea are proven to adopt a cut-throat approach regarding player sales under this regime, with Gittens standing out as the most obvious casualty of their current group of wingers.",

      "Isak eventually got what he wanted in the summer, but was his move to Liverpool really worth all of that effort?",
      "By resorting to drastic measures to seal his move to Liverpool from Newcastle United, Isak sacrificed pre-season to leave himself playing catch-up with his new teammates and just as he started to show signs of being back to his usual self, he suffered a leg break in a challenge with Tottenham’s Micky van de Ven and will have months on the sidelines.",
      "Isak remains a world-class striker capable of starring for any club in the world, but this unfortunate run of events have contributed to a chastening few months for Liverpool’s new British record signing, with his situation made more problematic by Hugo Ekitike’s performances.",
      "While Isak’s start to life at Liverpool has been ponderous at best, Ekitike immediately hit the ground running and has surely surpassed the expectations of even the most optimistic figures at the club.",
      "Especially considering Liverpool’s dire decline, 13 goal involvements in Ekitike’s first 25 competitive appearances is a fantastic effort. This is made even better by him also being a sublime technical footballer, resembling Thierry Henry in his pomp.",
      "So, as good as Isak clearly is, Liverpool would be just fine with Ekitike if push came to shove and the £130m that went on an unnecessary second new striker could be redistributed to land multiple new centre-backs and a successor for Mohamed Salah.",

      "The 26-year-old was expected to kick on this season, but he has dramatically gone backwards and is still without a Premier League goal this term.",
      "Injuries have played their part, but also the freakish form of Erling Haaland has meant he has not had a sniff up front, while he has also been outperformed by other Man City wingers, particularly Jeremy Doku.",

      "Casemiro’s unexpected resurgence has further exposed Ugarte’s limitations in possession, with Man Utd looking far worse when the former Sporting Lisbon player is on the pitch instead of the veteran.",
      "Ugarte’s woes have forced Man Utd to get back to the drawing board for a new No.6 as they eye Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson, with their current star’s possible move to a Turkish giant to play a huge role in the club’s priority midfield overhaul next year.",

      "Ruben Amorim has had a full season and now an entire calendar year as Manchester United boss. Whichever timeframe you view it from, and whatever context you apply, it’s been turgid.",
      "The manager will point to the league table as evidence that United enter 2026 in better shape than they stumbled into 2025, when Amorim was still getting his feet under the table at Old Trafford. A year later, this is his team, in his image. It was matched and, in some metrics, bettered than a team now mainly concerned with not being the Premier League’s worst ever.",
      "Being held by this Wolves side would inevitably prompt handwringing and teeth grinding on the Stretford End, but Tuesday’s 1-1 draw was not a result in isolation. It is the latest in a pattern of results and performances that Amorim owns to make it very difficult to be optimistic going into the new year.",
      "Everton: two wins in eight when they turned up. West Ham: two wins in 10. Bournemouth: two wins in 11. And Wolves: no wins in 18. All came to Old Trafford in the last six weeks and collectively left with double the number of points taken by the hosts.",
      "A bigger sample: Amorim has won just nine – losing the same number – of his 23 Premier League home games. Under him, United have a 39 per cent win ratio at Old Trafford.",
      "The manager knows that is not an acceptable record. That he doesn’t try to spin it any other way earns him more credit with many United fans than perhaps he is due. It resonates that Amorim is generally as exasperated as the fans over what his team have made them watch.",
      "But there is only so long that such honesty provides a pass before it washes no more. If that hasn’t expired after 12 months in charge, it certainly doesn’t stretch beyond a full calendar year.",
      "The deflating draw with Wolves underlined that United and Amorim appear to have had very different objectives for 2025.",
      "While the club were seeking simply to achieve a level of competency that would represent chronic underachievement in many previous years, Amorim appears to have been on a mission just to show United and the world how clever he is.",
      "Finally, after so long that many had given up hope of it ever happening, Amorim deviated from his precious 3-4-2-1 for the visit of Newcastle on Boxing Day. Lo and behold, putting footballers in a shape more suited to their individual characteristics prompted one of the better performances of the year, at least for 45 minutes.",
      "Amorim deserves some credit for ducking out of a corner his dogmatic tactical approach had backed him in to. He insisted he would never deviate from his formation, even going so far as to warn the Pope not to bother trying to convince him to choose a path of enlightenment.",
      "So insistent was he that he was almost damned either way: for sticking with methods that were not succeeding; or for going back on his word.",
      "United fans were far more willing to forgive the second of those sins than the first. Four at the back sparked an improved performance with limited resources and an all-too-rare home win, despite yet more peculiar in-game changes that bordered on further self-sabotage.",
      "Next up: winless Wolves at home. And while weighing up whether to stick with what worked or return to his old ways, it is hard to shake the suspicion that Amorim looked at the visit of the league’s worst side as an opportunity to show his system can work if we would all just give it a 427th chance.",
      "In many ways, we have brought this on ourselves. It is not just United fans – but it’s especially United fans – who demanded a philosophy, a coach with a clear, discernible style. Everyone insists on recognisable patterns of play, as if predictability isn’t the easiest thing in football to defend against.",
      "Players want it too. Too many now cannot think for themselves having been prescripted every pass and run. Maybe it is easier to play that way, but it certainly a lot less fun for everyone involved.",
      "Well, you wanted a philosophy, you’ve got one. And, as a consequence, one of the many managers who views validation of their principles above all else.",
      "While that remains the case in 2026 and for as long as Amorim won’t change, nor will United.",

The English club is looking for a player capable of making a difference both on and off the pitch, a generational leader around whom to build their new sporting project.

      "“I’ve just never understood why. You want your players going into a tournament full of confidence. Arrogant, almost. You want them knowing and thinking they can win. The press should big them up, help them, not tear them down like this. The press causes problems and puts doubts in their head, and changes the way they think.",
      "“I think if you change a player’s personality, you change how they play. That’s not always good. Far from it. I think the players need to just concentrate on what they’re doing. So if I was Jude, why would I come back when I can stay at Real Madrid and enjoy life at the same time, without bad press that comes for no reason.",
      "“I think he’s the go-to man for England, and I sometimes do not understand why he is in the crosshairs. He’s not perfect, but he’s performing well for club and country. It’s not like he has some huge arrogant attitude, or plays badly. They should leave him be and let him prepare mentally.”",

      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, but Newcastle’s failure to launch this season, Tottenham’s baffling home-away dichotomy, Enzo Maresca’s self-fulfilling title race predictions and Burnley’s winless run are all causing significant ripples.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",

      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they end 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should arbitrary position has been handed to them this week. But you still don’t want to find yourself right at the bottom of that group, do you? Having to accept that technically so far this season you’ve actually been worse than Spurs?",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Five wins from the last seven have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. Their only wins in the last six games, all of which were winnable, have come against Burnley. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon. A second December draw against Chelsea could be the start of something, but they urgently need a win. Arsenal as the first game of 2026 isn’t ideal; Dr Tottenham straight after it absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just further highlighted the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff. Like beating Newcastle and then drawing at home against the worst Premier League team of all time.",
      "The fact that United’s response to the Newcastle win was to talk about Champions League pushes and even in some outlandish cases title charges just shows how little the ‘United are just stuff that happens’ reality is being understood and accepted. Even yer man waiting for his haircut was getting cocky after beating Newcastle with Wolves up next.",
      "We need you all to grasp this: what United have done in their last game or even last handful of games has absolutely no bearing on what will happen next. They have not turned a corner. The truth is they turn so many corners that they just always end up back where they started.",
      "What does all this mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s rather cleverly survived through such a lowering of standards that he’s probably fine. They’re definitely a bit less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool at least showed a bit of something before hilariously running off with a point from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "And while Chelsea aren’t the first team to see apparent control of a game against Villa turn into a painful, perplexing defeat, they are perhaps the most profound example. And it was another that raised serious questions about the players and manager.",
      "A key element to this season is which team you land for the near back-to-back repeat rounds. Villa have turned having to play Arsenal twice in quick succession into a burgeoning conspiracy theory, for instance. Chelsea, on the other hand, got a huge boost: two games against Bournemouth while Bournemouth are in one of their relegation-form lows rather than Champions League-form highs. Failing to win either of those games is p*ss poor.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "And a deeply unconvincing win over Crystal Palace even more so – a result that in deeply Spurs fashion lifted them back to the very top of the away table – but the identity of the victim definitely helps Frank too. It can’t be doing him any harm that both Glasner and Andoni Iraola – the two most obvious in-league targets if Spurs did want to change course – are both having a tricky spell themselves.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",

      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that “fresh money is coming” to Man Utd with the Rasmus Hojlund permanent deal a “formality”.",
      "The Red Devils allowed Hojlund to leave Old Trafford in the summer in a loan deal until the end of the season with a €6m loan fee and a €44m obligation to make the deal permanent.",
      "Despite claims in Italy that Napoli could be “limited” in terms of money, Romano has assured Man Utd fans that the Hojlund deal will go through in 2026.",
      "It will provide the Red Devils with a healthy cash boost, while there’s also the possibility of further financial gains with Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford also set to leave, and Mason Greenwood having a big sell-on clause.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel in the early hours of Wednesday: “Very good news for Man Utd because Napoli confirm that they believe the obligation for Rasmus Hojlund will be just a formality.",
      "“It will happen in 2026. There were some stories about Napoli being limited in the market, not able to invest, but that’s not the case for Hojlund.",
      "READ: Transfer dominoes: Five moves set in motion by Man City signing Semenyo",
      "“United will have €50m from Hojlund’s deal (€44m obligation + €6m loan fee), and that is very important for news. It’s also the reason why they want to invest in 2026 because they will have fresh money from Hojlund’s deal.",
      "“Then there’s also the Jadon Sancho situation, they hold a big sell-on clause for Mason Greenwood, and of course, the Marcus Rashford situation.",
      "“For Manchester United, fresh money is coming.”",
      "In another video on Tuesday, Romano has maintained that Man Utd still have strong interest in Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "Romano said: “In terms of midfielders, one of the names I want to maintain since August, on Manchester United’s shortlist, is Carlos Baleba.",
      "“I can guarantee that Manchester United, even in the internal talks at the club, have not stopped discussing the name of Carlos Baleba.",
      "“Baleba is seen, still, as an ideal solution by Ruben Amorim and people at the club.”",
      "Romano added: “Together with Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace and Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, he [Baleba] is seen as one of the ideal central midfielders for Amorim.",
      "“Baleba is super appreciated by them. A January move is still seen as unlikely but any moment, January of summer, if Brighton decide to open doors to an exit for Baleba, United remain absolutely interested in the player.",
      "“Manchester United remain in contact with people close to the player.”",

      "“But that wasn’t it. They were staying to boo them.”",
      "Neville thought their display “was the baddest of the bad” against Wolves and the Man Utd legend was frustrated by Amorim’s choice of team against the Premier League’s bottom side.",
      "Former Man Utd right-back Neville added: “I’m not going to get emotional because I don’t think it’s something that is helpful for anybody but that was the baddest of the bad, that.",
      "“We saw them warming up before the game and they were warming up in the system of three at the back with [Ayden] Heaven to the right, [Lisandro] Martinez and [Luke] Shaw.",
      "“Then, up front they had [Diogo] Dalot at right wing-back, Dorgu at left wing-back and then they had Zirkzee in the right channel, [Matheus] Cunha in the left channel and [Benjamin] Sesko.",
      "“I said at the time that they were warming up in wrong shape before Newcastle to fool everybody the other night and then they ended up playing a back-four, so I said to ignore that.",
      "“As soon as I saw that shape was going to be played… I’ve seen Zirkzee playing in that right channel before and it just doesn’t work.",
      "“We know that Dorgu is a left wing-back and we’ve seen him play there a number of times now and he does okay there, he’s willing, and so does Dalot at right wing-back. I think they’re both willing. I’ve played that position and I think I was a pretty decent right-back… it’s a bloody tough position to play right wing-back or left wing-back, it just is.",
      "“I thought Dorgu was so good on the right wing against Newcastle, I just thought he looked free. He could come in on his left foot, he looked more inventive, he looked more like a wide player.",
      "“So I was struggling with it from 30 seconds but what I didn’t want to do was start the negativity after 30 seconds because the reality of it is that you’ve got to let them settle in and if they go and score two then you look a little bit stupid as well.”",
      "READ: Amorim asking for trouble as latest Man Utd disaster exposes false PL position, baffling transfer claim",
      "Neville continued: “Let’s be really clear: after five minutes I thought, ‘That’s not going to work all night, that’s going to be a bad performance and he’s going to have to change that after 15 minutes’… after 15 minutes he didn’t change it and after 20 minutes I said, ‘This is it’.",
      "“I think my words were, ‘They might score two in the next 20 minutes but this is not right’, and I’ve been very complimentary of the last two or three performances: Bournemouth, Villa and Newcastle.",
      "“There were things in those three performances that I’ve liked and I genuinely believed that entertainment and performance matters. I matters for two reasons at his club: these fans come here to be entertained, like every other football fan in the country, but you’ve got to entertain here… there’s 75,000 of them and they want entertaining.",
      "“Secondly, I genuinely believe that performance leads to results. I know some people say that results aren’t everything, but it’s very difficult to win a lot of football matches if you’re not performing well.”",
      "Man Utd had some excuses for their poor display with Bruno Fernandes out injured and Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui all at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Neville said: “It was really simple tonight. The AFCON players aren’t here, we know the injured players aren’t there and it’s actually made his job more simple. There’s more sympathy for him.",
      "“Sesko plays up top, Cunha plays to the left, Dorgu plays to the right, Zirkzee plays in that little hold off Sesko. You’ve got [Manuel] Ugarte and Casemiro in midfield, you’ve got Luke Shaw at left-back, Ayden Heaven and Martinez at centre-back and you’ve got Dalot at right-back. It’s not not an amazing team but it’s really obvious that that’s the team that should be picked, in the system that we should be playing.",
      "“It should have been picked and it was so obvious. It’s Zirzkee’s best position, dropping in, Sesko’s got someone close to him which means he’s not playing up front on his own, Cunha’s on the left and can drift in and that’s fine, you’ve got Shaw who can go round him and he’s really good to play with on that side.",
      "“You’ve then got Dalot coming from behind on the other side but you’ve got Dorgu that can cut in which means Dalot go round.",
      "“The big question marks you would have in that system would be Casemiro and Ugarte, and Heaven and Martinez. However, I thought Ugarte and Casemiro did really well against Newcastle, I thought Ugarte and had his best game for the club, and I thought Heaven and Martinez did brilliantly against Newcastle.",
      "“So I thought those four would just be certain to start there. I always want to say that it’s not just the manager, not just the players as there’s a culmination of everything when you get a bad performance.",
      "“But I do think tonight that the manager has to look at that and think, “I got that wrong and I complicated it”, because they just needed simplicity.”",
      "Amorim could not avoid more criticism with Neville calling all of his substitutions “bizarre”, he went on: “The substitutions made us worse, they made Manchester United worse. Every single substitution was bizarre.",
      "“I don’t know what’s happened with Zirkzee at half-time. If he was injured then fair enough, get him off the pitch.",
      "“If Zirkzee wasn’t injured and that was a tactical substitution then it was a really poor one. And I’m not saying Zirkzee is Eric Cantona… he’s not, let’s by clear, not by any stretch of the imagination.",
      "“But I have to say, he needed to be out there for physicality, for presence, for experience and he’d scored.",
      "“You couldn’t take him off so I’m hoping he’s injured. I don’t mean that in a bad way! I’m hoping he’s injured for Ruben Amorim.”",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "City are said to be closing in on the signing of Semenyo having shown the most determination to trigger the winger’s release clause in his Bournemouth contract.",
      "As ever, one transfer leads to another. And a few more besides.",
      "Here we assess how Semenyo joining City could prompt major moves for five other players. Starting with the first trigger…",
      "Semenyo will be the first domino to fall in January, with Manchester City seemingly far down a road they rarely, if ever, lose their way.",
      "City want Semenyo signed sharpish, not just because the terms of the winger’s buy-out clause in his Bournemouth contract dictate so, but also to keep the other vultures at bay.",
      "Until Semenyo has a blue scarf above his head while revealing a soft spot for Oasis, Curly Watts and very tall floodlights, there remains the feeling Liverpool might attempt to throw an expensive spanner in the works.",
      "But we just don’t see City losing out here. And not only because it would screw the whole premise on which this feature is built.",
      "",
      "City already have a surplus of players, with Savinho and/or Oscar Bobb set to be the big losers if they snare Semenyo.",
      "Weirdly, the Brazilian has had the same number of Premier League minutes (467) as Bobb but neither winger is really doing the business in Pep’s mind. Savinho has two league assists to Bobb’s one. Neither has scored a Premier League goal to take any burden off Erling Haaland’s shoulders. Good job, then, that he’s just a ridiculous goalscorer.",
      "Still, with domestic and European competition fierce in what could be the manager’s final half-season at City, Guardiola is clearly keen to upgrade on the right flank, with Savinho the most sellable asset. Especially while Tottenham retain a long-standing interest in the 21-year-old.",
      "Spurs, apparently, are keen to gauge Savinho’s level of interest before they proceed any further only to be covered in custard again. The winger will be feeling the chill at City and Spurs could offer a more defined role than the cameos on either flank he has been restricted to by Guardiola.",
      "MORE: Man City signing Semenyo will give Guardiola a quarter of the 20 biggest January signings ever",
      "",
      "Even before they have signed Savinho, Spurs already seem to be making room by off-loading their Europa League final goalscorer.",
      "Johnson is being fought over by Palace and Bournemouth, with other clubs also said to be keen on the Wales attacker.",
      "Bournemouth seemed to be in a strong position given their obvious need for a Semenyo replacement and the £65million they will have burning a hole in their pocket. Johnson would cost around half that amount, but Palace have reportedly nipped in ahead of the Cherries.",
      "Ornstein says the Eagles have agreed a deal with Spurs worth in the region of £35million, but Johnson is still mulling over his options. So Bournemouth retain hope of landing the 24-year-old, even if Palace are the frontrunners.",
      "",
      "Be it Johnson or anyone else, someone has to replace Semenyo at Bournemouth.",
      "The Cherries’ have slid at breakneck speed into a relegation battle few foresaw just a few weeks ago when Semenyo was on fire while Andoni Iraola’s lurked in the European spots.",
      "But seven games without a goal or assist from Semenyo saw Bournemouth take just five points from 21, highlighting the importance of finding a ready-made replacement for the Ghanaian, especially if they are to spend the second half of the season looking over their shoulder.",
      "The thing is, Bournemouth don’t buy oven-ready. That’s not their model. Almost certainly, they will cast their net into Europe or, as reports suggest is more likely, dip their toe back into the Championship talent pool.",
      "There, where they discovered Semenyo, they will find Fatawu, who has been catching eyes at Leicester from other Premier League clubs beyond the south coast. Sunderland and Everton have both been credited with an interest in the 21-year-old but Bournemouth’s means and haste makes them heavy favourites for Semenyo’s compatriot.",
      "",
      "Semenyo’s switch to City will leave almost the rest of the Big Six disappointed. For some, sure, it was a good opportunity to sign a top-class player for a relatively good price. But missing out allows them to concentrate on the priorities they should be focused on in January. We’re looking at you, Manchester United, and that gaping hole in your midfield.",
      "For Liverpool, though, there remains room in their squad for a Semenyo-like signing. Mo Salah is away at AFCON and Alexander Isak is out until perhaps the spring.",
      "Neither of those circumstances should prompt the Reds to splurge on another forward to fill a short-term void. But Salah’s absence is likely to be a more permanent arrangement, if not from this window, then most likely the summer.",
      "Other issues in Arne Slot’s squad mean it would not be a bad idea to get a jump on sourcing Salah’s replacement. Perhaps Yan Diomande at RB Leipzig? Liverpool certainly have an in with the teenager’s club, and a half-season head-start on the settling process could be useful.",
      "Diomande, though, remains raw and perhaps more expensive than Rodrygo, a player Liverpool have long admired, along with Manchester City. You would think, however, that Semenyo’s signing ends City’s interest in the Brazilian.",
      "Rodrygo joining Liverpool is undoubtedly the trickiest link in this particular domino chain. The Reds will have you believe they are not planning anything quite so grand in January, and the centre of their defence remains a bigger issue than uncertainty in their attack. This one remains speculative but Liverpool are full of surprises.",
      "",
      "Semenyo is certainly a boon for City midway through a title fight which is looking likely to be a humdinger. Will Arsenal respond?",
      "We think so. And, more to the point, Mikel Arteta seems to think so too: “We’re Arsenal and we have to be looking at it… we have to be actively looking.”",
      "Arsenal are entering January in a position of authority because they bought big in the summer. Liverpool spent more but the Gunners’ net spend was greater than anyone.",
      "Having built the strongest squad in the Premier League, it relieves the pressure around the January window somewhat. But despite their depth, Arteta’s resources are still being stretched. Without some swift and considerable relief on the fitness front, Arsenal will go back into the market.",
      "To sign whom? Honestly, we don’t know. We doubt Arsenal know at this point. Quite likely, they will react to the circumstances they encounter around the middle of the month. Which, in their position, is a sound approach.",
      "And the identity almost doesn’t matter in regards to countering City’s swoop for Semenyo. Arteta and Andrea Berta will be desperate to avoid a scenario in the summer where they have fallen short in a title race once more having sat on their hands when they had the opportunity to bolster their ranks and morale mid-season.",
      "Enzo Maresca rocking up at Newcastle, with Frank Lampard replacing him at Chelsea, has been forecasted for a 2026 which will end with Arsenal as champions.",

      "Ruben Amorim is really asking for trouble at Manchester United, with his side reaching a new low against Wolves on an exposing night.",
      "There is far more optimism surrounding Manchester United this season than in 2024/25, which is largely due to a notable upturn in results.",
      "Yes, there have also been reasons for optimism with Man Utd‘s transfer business, as it’s difficult to deem their most recent window anything other than an overwhelming success regarding how they dealt with incomings and outgoings.",
      "This, plus head coach Ruben Amorim finally leaving his ego at the door to show a willingness to adapt (for a little bit), has contributed to Man Utd’s growth this season as they have become a more effective unit.",
      "Still, the Red Devils remain miles from their end goal of being a squad capable of consistently challenging for major trophies, as evidenced by most of their performances this term.",
      "The changes in personnel and tactics have led to more points, but these factors have papered over the cracks as performances have been poor more often than good.",
      "This month alone, Man Utd have won two of their six Premier League games. Of these victories, one came via too many nervy moments with a pretty full-strength XI against Wolves, while the other was a smash-and-grab 1-0 victory against Newcastle United.",
      "So, despite United starting Tuesday night on the brink of the Champions League places, there has been enough evidence to suggest that they are in a false league position, and this was laid bare in the second of this month’s meetings against Wolves.",
      "Man Utd are impacted more than most by AFCON absences, while injuries have also taken their toll, but they still had more than enough talent in their squad to beat a side that headed into Tuesday’s match with only two points from their opening 18 Premier League games.",
      "Therefore, the Red Devils’ 1-1 draw is incredibly alarming. The result and Amorim reverting to his preferred 3-4-3 system, which he himself admitted is not working, is bad enough, but it is made worse when you consider that they went punch-for-punch with Wolves in an evenly matched game, which ended with the worst team in the Premier League having more xG.",
      "United’s overreliance on Matheus Cunha as their sole attacking threat without Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo was clear, with goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee’s breakthrough for his side’s only goal coming via a huge deflection to wrong foot Jose Sa.",
      "This came against the run of play, and Wolves were rewarded for their positive work with an equaliser before the break, with Ladislav Krejci’s header beating Senne Lammens following Zirkzee’s poor attempt at a clearing header.",
      "The second half was similarly back-and-forth as two poor Premier League sides could not be separated, with the full-time whistle and certain baffling substitutions met with boos from the justifiably frustrated home crowd.",
      "Amorim revealed before tonight’s game that he is “not going to ask for more signings” in January to “avoid mistakes”, indicating that he is willing to “suffer now” if it means they will be “two steps ahead in the summer”.",
      "But with Amorim’s side continuing to take one step forward and two back, their attack still blunt without the class of a few individuals and the head coach contributing to another nothing performance after finding a roundabout way to revert to his failing system with square pegs in round holes, he is asking for trouble and may not see out the next phase of “suffering” as goodwill runs thin.",

      "The agent of Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens believes the club were “right” to get rid of Andre Onana, a decision he says they made late in summer.",
      "United suffered through Onana last season, with the former Inter Milan goalkeeper making countless mistakes. They benched him for Altay Bayindir early this season, and Onana’s only United appearance this term came in the League Cup against Grimsby.",
      "He conceded two goals and then 12 penalties as the Red Devils were embarrassingly dumped out of the cup, and that might have been Onana’s last appearance for the club, as he was quickly loaned out to Trabzonspor, with Lammens being signed from Royal Antwerp.",
      "The Belgian’s agent, Mark Volders, has revealed the decision to let Onana go came late in the summer, but has now been vindicated.",
      "“Those critical voices… the big problem was that they expected a very well-known name, like [Gianluigi] Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martínez,” he told HBVL.",
      "“But actually, for a long time, the intention within United was for Onana to stay and for Senne to be given time to adjust.",
      "“Ultimately, they changed their tune right at the very end, Onana left, and fully embraced Senne. But in hindsight, you can only say that United was right about that.”",
      "Lammens has looked a far more composed presence in the United net, not making the mistakes that Onana did.",
      "Had the Cameroonian remained at the club, Lammens might not have been given the opportunities to show what he could do, so the risk taken by the club has seemingly paid off.",
      "Onana is not having the best spell away from the club, either, as in 13 games at Trabzonspor, he’s conceded 19 goals and has only kept a clean sheet on three occasions.",
      "The situation of Onana further vindicates United’s decision to part company with him and focus their attention on the future with Lammens.",
      "Trabzonspor don’t have an option to buy Onana, but if Lammens keeps playing as he is, they will surely look to sell the Cameroonian in the summer.",
      "Legendary former United keeper Peter Schmeichel is impressed with Lammens, too.",
      "He recently said: “He’s only 23 years old, he’s come in and there’s calm at the back four, there’s not this chaos where they don’t want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man.",
      "“And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he’s not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has insisted that summer signing Senne Lammens will be the Red Devils’ goalkeeper “for the next ten years”.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed why he is not confident about Manchester United’s chances of winning the Premier League under Ruben Amorim.",

      "Galatasaray are said to be preparing a £21.8million package for the summer transfer of Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte after loaning him in January.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear who his favourites are in the midfield. Generally playing a 3-4-2-1 formation, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes are the two men who have played most often as those two.",
      "With Fernandes now injured, Amorim has altered the United formation to 4-2-3-1, with Ugarte partnering Casemiro, and Mason Mount playing in the No.10 role.",
      "But Ugarte has started just four league games this term, largely when one of Casemiro or Fernandes has been unavailable.",
      "What’s more, United have spent months being linked with a host of midfield stars, such as Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Ruben Neves.",
      "It seems they’re looking to strengthen their engine room and that will surely see Ugarte become surplus to requirements.",
      "He has clubs after him, with Turkish media reporting Galatasaray are preparing a January loan offer for Ugarte.",
      "They’d be looking to take him on loan with an option to sign the midfielder permanently for €25million (£21.8m).",
      "That is slightly below the €30million (£26.1m) that United are reportedly looking for if they are to part company with Ugarte.",
      "Given United paid an initial €50million (£43.5m) for Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain in 2024, they’d be making a big loss on their investment if they agreed to that.",
      "That said, the midfielder’s performances since joining United have not suggested he should command a fee far north of that.",
      "Whether he lands at Galatasaray remains to be seen, as French media reports Lyon and Napoli are both interested in him, and their respective stature would suggest those moves might be preferable.",
      "It is suggested that Galatasaray have made contact, though, with Lucas Torreira and Fernando Muslera attempting to convince their Uruguay team-mate to join them.",
      "But the move would be dependent on United letting him go, and while in the summer that might be possible, if they don’t sign a new midfielder in January, with Fernandes currently out and Mount having struggled with injuries in the past, as well as Kobbie Mainoo’s potential exit, it would be a risk for them to allow Ugarte to leave in the middle of the season.",
      "Cristian Romero is a liability as Spurs captain and Manuel Ugarte is a historically bad problem for Manchester United. But at least Morgan Rogers is good.",
      "Injuries and suspensions have forced Ruben Amorim to give last chances to three Manchester United stars against Aston Villa.",
      "Man Utd have chosen Manuel Ugarte as the player they want to ‘sacrifice’ in January in order to bring in new players, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘held talks’ over signing Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves, who is also linked with Newcastle United and Spurs.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United will make a ‘U-turn’ on letting Kobbie Mainoo leave the club during the winter transfer window on one condition.",

      "From just 11 Serie A games this term, he has reached four goals – with two assists – and also has two Champions League goals to his name.",
      "Hojlund seems a better fit in Italy than he was in England, and according to Pazzini, he’s one of the very best strikers in the Serie A.",
      "Pazzini told Sportsmediaset: “At the moment, Hojlund, under [Antonio] Conte, is the strongest striker in Serie A alongside Lautaro [Martinez]. Since he arrived, he has undergone an incredible transformation.",
      "“He has always been a good player, but with great instinct, great power, he was a wild horse. Conte took him, educated him and raised him.",
      "“Now he’s a fantastic striker because he plays for the team, he doesn’t make a single mistake, he never gets anticipated, he plays short, he plays long, he’s vicious in front of goal.",

      "Inter Milan striker Martinez is currently the top scorer in Serie A with nine goals, alongside three assists, and Christian Pulisic is the only other player who’s scored more goals than Hojlund this term.",
      "As such, it’s high praise that Hojlund is seen as level with Martinez, who has not failed to surpass 10 Serie A goals in any of the last six seasons, and has 124 goals in the league over his career.",
      "Conte is clearly happy with the progress of the Manchester United loanee, as he said recently: “Hojlund is a player who, first of all, is very young, but above all, has a lot of room for improvement.",

      "Mateus Mane delivered a player of the match performance for Wolves in their shock draw at Manchester United and in a season in which the supporters have been starved of positives, the 18-year-old academy prospect has become the fans' new darling.",
      "They chanted his name throughout, a new song to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries, and roared with delight when he tackled former favourite Matheus Cunha. Mane played with energy and quality, just days after lasting the full 90 minutes at Anfield.",
      "It is the tactical flexibility that has impressed Rob Edwards. A more natural winger, he was moved inside midway through the game against Liverpool and had been lined up for a No 10 role at Old Trafford until Santi Bueno's withdrawal forced a change of plan.",
      "\"Today obviously things have changed and he is playing as an eight,\" explained Edwards. \"So to show that level of understanding, really, really impressive. He took the ball, didn't look fazed, played with bravery, but then his work-rate as well.",
      "\"That recovery late on against Casemiro, [after] I think he tried a little backheel. That's the stuff that we need. It's great that an 18-year-old at the moment is showing that display.\" It might not keep Wolves up but Mane is helping to change the mood.Adam Bate",
      "Newcastle have looked their best under Eddie Howe when they play with speed, aggression and verticality.",
      "That edge has been missing at times this season, especially away from home.",
      "Where Nick Woltemade offers presence, structure and link play between the lines, Yoane Wissa brings a bit of chaos and directness. He runs the channels, pulls centre-backs wide and asks uncomfortable questions of defensive units that want to hold a compact shape.",
      "Against Burnley, that difference was obvious within minutes and Newcastle managed to score twice inside seven of them.",
      "Two goals in two starts, capped by a decisive contribution in the win over Burnley, has quickly thrust Wissa back into the spotlight.",
      "The early signs suggest Newcastle now have two different attacking profiles for different types of games.Lewis Jones",
      "Aston Villa had the suspensions of Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara to add to a four-player injury list against Arsenal. The result was a weakened starting line-up and a depleted bench which included three untested teenagers.",
      "Unai Emery might now have to add Amadou Onana to the absentee list against Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Aston Villa were matching Arsenal at the time of his enforced withdrawal due to injury at half-time. It all went wrong after that.",
      "Arsenal were excellent in the second period, of course, but they were also far fresher, with Villa having played out a similarly draining away game against Chelsea only three days earlier. They had gone to their limits to extend their winning run to 11 games.",
      "Emery was also justified in questioning the scheduling which pitted them against Arsenal for a second time this season before having faced all of the other 18 sides, with their first game against Forest still to come. A quirk of the fixture list maybe, but one that hurt them as their winning run was brought to an untimely end.Nick Wright",
      "Burnley's relegation fight has been defined by fine margins and missed moments, but Armando Broja's performance in the defeat to Newcastle offered something they have been craving for months: an authority up top.",
      "From the first whistle, Broja played with purpose. He ran channels aggressively, pinned centre-backs and demanded the ball with his body as much as his voice. This was the Broja who bursts through defenders rather than bouncing off them. The Broja who looks like a Premier League striker rather than one searching for rhythm.",
      "It gives Burnley something to build from. The gap to safety is still only six points. Teams that go down often do so long before the points column confirms it. They can be mentally beaten. Burnley aren't there yet and Broja is central to that resistance.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton boss David Moyes praised his squad, with specific reference to players like Nathan Patterson who came into the game short of regular minutes, following the 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Injuries to Michael Keane and Charly Alcaraz for this fixture only added to their problems. Moyes said he was working with around 30 per cent of the squad after the game and he was right.",
      "Through a combination of international duty at AFCON and injuries, Everton are threadbare.",
      "Only two players on their bench this evening - Jack Grealish and Beto - had a Premier League appearance to their name.",
      "The Toffees are within touching distance of the top five but if they want to keep that positioning - or even build on it - they need reinforcements.",
      "Waiting for players to return isn't enough. The January transfer window could be arriving at the perfect time.Patrick Rowe",
      "The Hammers are still hurting after their draw with Brighton. An eight-game winless run has done nothing to shake off their relegation fears as they enter the New Year.",
      "Mistakes are still being made - there were a couple of early misplaced passes out the back that create unnecessary pressure. And lessons weren't learned - it was no surprise West Ham conceded two first-half penalties via sloppy challenges.",
      "It was Ollie Scarles' costly error on Saturday against Fulham, then it was Max Kilman's lazy leg and Lucas Paqueta's needless rugby tackle against Brighton. All basic errors.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has praised West Ham's spirit but that only takes you so far. Barring a few Jarrod Bowen and Paqueta moments, there needs to be more quality in this Hammers team, or 2026 is the year they go down.Sam Blitz",
      "Brighton's draw to West Ham means that manager Fabian Hurzeler has yet to win a Premier League game in December in 12 attempts (D7, L5) - the most games ever by a PL coach without winning. The Seagulls' current winless run now stands at six games, and sees them two points worse off than at this point last year.",
      "Entering into 2026, it seems the German's side are suffering many of the same problems they faced in 2024. Brighton's gung-ho style has produced a lack of consistency prominent over both of Brighton's seasons under their manager.",
      "Today may have been a point gained - with Brighton coming from behind twice - but it so easily could have been more. 61 per cent possession, 2.85 xG and an avoidable penalty all evidence that Brighton need not have shared the spoils against an opponent with the second-worst home form in the league.",
      "But what seems so much more the cause of recent poor form is less quantifiable. The Seagulls never seem to know when to take the sting out of a game. Even in the last 20 minutes, which Brighton dominated, there were signs of vulnerability. Brighton attacked relentlessly - and West Ham always looked like they were one good through ball away from scoring the winner.",
      "Hurzeler has clearly proven he has the talent to manage at this level. But Brighton's lack of progression over his tenure - and runs of poor form during back-to-back festive periods - cast doubt over how much better they can get whilst lacking the street smarts that the Brighon head coach needs so badly to acquire.Noah Langford",

      "Manchester United are one of the clubs monitoring RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande.",
      "United are not certain to pursue another winger after appearing to miss out on Antoine Semenyo to Manchester City.",
      "But they may accelerate their interest in Diomande if other clubs start moving for the highly rated young forward in this window.",
      "There are other big clubs keen on Diomande, a 19-year-old Ivory Coast international who is currently at the Africa Cup of Nations with United winger Amad Diallo.",
      "Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-German are also thought to be tracking his development closely.",
      "The teenager has scored seven goals and contributed four assists in 16 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig this season.",
      "Diomande has started both of Ivory Coast's matches at AFCON and has two goals in five appearances for his country.",
      "Speaking to Marcel Schafer alongside a number of other reporters in September, the RB Leipzig managing director for sport held up Diomande as an example of a \"young jewel\" identified as part of the club's rebuild this season following such a disappointing season.",
      "After eight consecutive European campaigns, Leipzig missed out on continental competition for the first time since their ascension to the German top flight and the signing of Diomande from Spanish side Leganes reflected the need for a refresh.",
      "\"He definitely fits in the profile we are looking for,\" Schafer explained. \"Young, hungry and high potential. Even though he was just six months in Spain, he had really some impressive appearances in LaLiga and we looked for these kind of players.\"",
      "He added: \"We look for players who have a physical ability and we look for players who can handle one on one, who can create chances and who are able to finish some actions. Diomande has certainly demonstrated that in his debut Bundesliga season.\"",
      "The teenager scored on his Leipzig debut in the cup before netting in three consecutive appearances in October and bagging a hat-trick against Freiburg just before travelling out to Morocco to represent Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter.",
      "The prospect of losing Diomande so quickly would not have been part of the plan when they paid €20m to sign him in the summer but Leipzig are pragmatic about their business model, honing young talent and selling them on for a significant profit.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim claims journalists and pundits calling for him to change his team's formation left him with little choice but to stick with it, fearing he would lose the dressing room if the players thought he was reacting to criticism from outside",
      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 08:47, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's days of solely playing with a back three are over and revealed he refrained from changing formation earlier to ensure his players did not feel he was caving in to media pressure.",
      "\"But when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim started with a back four for the first time as United head coach in the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day - when he was without a number of key players because of injury and the Africa Cup of Nations - after signs of the team showing greater in-game flexibility in recent weeks.",
      "The 40-year-old had been defiant in the face of intense scrutiny about his unwillingness to alter his formation amid alarming results which led to his side finishing 15th in the league last season, insisting he would only change at a time of his choosing even if it cost him his job.",
      "Amorim, who has overseen improved results this season, admits player availability has forced his hand somewhat, but believes his squad are now ready to change because they understand his philosophy.",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players [so] we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.",
      "\"I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve. That was something that I was talking about.",
      "\"But then when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you. I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"When we are playing well in our system, I think that is the moment to change, if it is a better thing to win the next game. That is what we did [against Newcastle].\"",
      "There were certainly eyebrows raised in the room when Amorim explained that his reluctance to switch formation earlier had been because of fears that his own Manchester United players would perceive it as him bowing to media pressure.",
      "Given that Amorim's unflinching honesty has been as consistent as his commitment to his 3-4-3 formation, there is little reason to question the sincerity of his comments, only the logic behind them. If he always intended to adapt then why now? Why not earlier?",
      "His argument has been that the priority was to ensure his players knew the system inside and out, being able to perfect it before expanding the repertoire. But results have hardly been so stellar as to be persuaded that this is now the case. And he has had time.",
      "A squad depleted by absences and stretched by a more demanding fixture list might explain why the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle was an opportune moment. But it would require the memory of a goldfish not to look back and find many others too.",
      "How about August at Grimsby when Mason Mount was wedged in at left wing-back? What about the September defeat to Brentford when Mount came on in the same position? Gary Neville described that decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\" at the time.",
      "United lost a European final in May in which Amorim was so steadfast in sticking to his formation that he made like-for-like substitutes with his team chasing not just a trophy but the transformative Champions League qualification that victory would bring.",
      "Without European football, he has had not only had a pre-season to prepare but that exit to Grimsby has afforded United a particularly light schedule. That time has been spent training in different systems but it has taken until Christmas for a formation shift.",
      "Within three points of the top four, Amorim's belated flexibility could yet come to be regarded as a masterstroke, an example of his patient evolution of this team. But after a year of making the case that his formation was non-negotiable, it remains a curious call.",

      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title and it has already been put to the test with a raft of injuries.",
      "Mikel Arteta has said Arsenal \"have to be actively looking\" at the market in January after losing more players than they had anticipated.",
      "Arsenal will always keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal have been looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less-than-convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliott's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so he cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool, but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Manchester City are closing in on a full agreement to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth with the final details of his £65m release clause being discussed between the clubs.",
      "In response, Bournemouth will want to sign a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone, given Semenyo almost left in the summer.",
      "Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, Bournemouth are looking to recruit a goalkeeper again to find someone who can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League, thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool.",
      "There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left-sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Tottenham and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing of midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing him in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season, but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer, but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON.",
      "Palace have agreed a £34m deal with Tottenham for Brennan Johnson but the winger is yet to make a final decision over his future.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right-wing back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January, he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",

      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at, but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League, especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January, but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Signing a centre-back is also a possibility in January for Leeds after the change in formation to 3-5-2 if the right deal materialises, although improving the forward line is the priority.",
      "The Leeds boss has shown his team's flexibility in recent games by switching to a back four mid-game to come back in draws against Liverpool, Brentford and Sunderland and so the club have options to manage the centre-back situation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlow, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window, even after spending over £200m net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah putting his future firmly on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad, but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament, which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition that they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract, they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield, but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City are closing in on a full agreement to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth with the final details of his £65m release clause being discussed between the clubs.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting older, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United look set to miss out on Antoine Semenyo to rivals Manchester City but spending £65m on the winger in January could have potentially reduced their summer budget.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires caution but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "Defenders Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are currently out injured. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for the likes of Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Crystal Palace have agreed a £34m fee with Spurs for Johnson, who is yet to make a final decision over his future amid interest from Bournemouth. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season.",
      "Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Randal Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026.",

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Rayan Cherki's creativity for Man City and how his form changes the Premier League title picture. Plus: Jeremie Frimpong's pace helping Liverpool and Ayden Heaven's growing reputation at Man Utd",
      "Monday 29 December 2025 11:20, UK",
      "It was not until the start of November that Pep Guardiola left Rayan Cherki on the pitch for over an hour of a Premier League game. The player provided two assists that day against Bournemouth and has started eight of the last nine Premier League games.",
      "Manchester City have won all but one of them to reignite their title hopes and Cherki's role in that has been significant. Most obviously, he scored the winner against Nottingham Forest at the weekend. But his assist for the opener was more typical.",
      "Cherki has provided seven Premier League assists since the start of November, more than any other player in the competition in that time. It is more than twice as many as all but two players - Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes and Fulham's Harry Wilson.",
      "The difference is that while Fernandes and Wilson are the set-piece takers for their respective teams, all seven of Cherki's assists have come from open play. No other Premier League player has more than three assists from open play during this period.",
      "The key for Guardiola has been getting Cherki in possession of the ball in those areas of the pitch where he can cause the most problems for the opposition. At Forest, although many of those touches were on the right, he was able to do damage centrally.",
      "All three of the chances that he created, including for Tijjani Reijnders' goal, came from forward passes from central positions. Since the start of November, no player in the Premier League has completed more through-balls than the France international.",
      "Tellingly, that game against the Cherries was the first time that Guardiola had named Cherki and Phil Foden in the same starting line-up. It is seven wins from eight in all competitions with them together since then, the twin playmakers proving crucial.",
      "Back in October, the best case for City reclaiming the title relied on Erling Haaland bludgeoning opponents and covering up the flaws in this team. Now, something is taking shape. There is more to this City. Cherki's impact highlights that clearly.",
      "Rob Edwards was encouraged by Wolves' start but about a quarter of an hour into their game at Liverpool, it changed. \"Liverpool began to force us back,\" he explained. \"They changed one or two bits and got a lot of numbers high so it was hard for us to get out.\"",
      "It was around that time that Arne Slot could be seen on the touchline urging Jeremie Frimpong to move higher up. In the latter stages of the first half at Anfield, the nominal right-back played right up against Wolves' back line. It brought the breakthrough goal.",
      "\"Last week, he had the assist against Tottenham and today he had a great assist against Wolves,\" said Slot when discussing Frimpong in the press conference afterwards. \"Pace, that is what he has and that is so important and crucial in modern-day football.\"",
      "He explained: \"To create something against a low-block, teams that defend with so many players, usually teams break this down with set-pieces. Now that is not our biggest strength.\" But Frimpong's pace can help them open teams up another way.",
      "He raced past two Wolves players before crossing for Ryan Gravenberch to score. \"Pure individual ability - quick, bam, bam and a cut-back cross. Okay, we were positioned in the right position, but that is the pace I always wanted to bring in in the summer.\"",
      "This was only Frimpong's second Premier League start since his arrival from Bayer Leverkusen, injury hampering his first half-season in a Liverpool shirt. \"Now, if he is fit, he can definitely help us.\" The opening goal in beating Wolves showed precisely why.",
      "A word too for Ayden Heaven, who earned Gary Neville's player of the match award in Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Heaven produced eight clearances and one vital block to help preserve a precious clean sheet.",
      "Ruben Amorim's switch to a back four was a major talking point but whatever the formation it seems that the teenage defender has forced himself into the plans. It is now five starts in a row since coming in for the first time this season against West Ham.",
      "\"I am really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you do not feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game. No, you feel that he is improving during the game.",
      "Amorim continued: \"I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So in this moment, if he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "One recalls Hayden being presented to the supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford in February following his signing from Arsenal and there being no great sense that he was someone who would have a significant role to play before the calendar year was out.",
      "United lost that game 2-0 to Crystal Palace with Leny Yoro in the team and now Heaven appears to be ahead of the young Frenchman in Amorim's pecking order. Like Yoro, his progress is unlikely be linear. There will be setbacks. But Heaven's reputation is growing.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",
