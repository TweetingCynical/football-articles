      "Manchester United bosses have no plans to consult Sir Alex Ferguson about who the next permanent manager should be.",
      "United's owners, the Glazers, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have no desire to get Fergie's input on what could be a defining decision for the club's long-term future.",
      "United are expected to announce a caretaker-boss next week, before making a permanent appointment in the summer. Names on the shortlist include Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino.",
      "United will be looking for their third full-time boss since 2024 - and seventh since Fergie retired in 2013.",
      "Fergie is known to be a huge admirer of Pochettino - and has pushed for him to be appointed United boss in the past. While the Scot is also close friends with Italian serial winner Ancelotti.",
      "But the powerbrokers at United, which also includes chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, are confident of being able to make the right choice without Fergie's influence.",
      "Back in 2024 Ratcliffe and INEOS terminated Fergie's contract as a global ambassador for the club. The move was part of cost-cutting measures at the English giants.",
      "But Fergie still remains a huge presence at the club where he won 38 major trophies during his 26-year reign as manager.",
      "He attends a lot of games and even visited the Carrington training ground 24 hours after Amorim had been sacked to speak with senior club officials.",
      "Some will view the decision not to consult with Fergie as a major snub. But there would be nothing to stop Fergie from contacting club officials to offer his opinion, if he still wanted to.",
      "The decision comes hours after ex-United captain sent a brutal message to his former boss, indicating that his presence at Old Trafford is 'hanging around the club like a bad smell'.",
      "\"Who is making the decisions? [Sir Jim] Ratcliffe, Wilcox? Who is going into the interview process, getting a feeler for them and saying, 'this is the guy for us'.\"",
      "For his part, Keane recommended his old employers turn to Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, to help transform their fortunes. He added: \"I'd go with Eddie Howe. I like him",
      "\"I like what he's done. He's managed a lot of games. When his teams are at it, they'll play good football. He has his critics, but I like what he's done at Newcastle. He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.\"",

      "Former Manchester United assistant boss Rui Faria has seemingly waded into the turmoil at Old Trafford with a mysterious social media message following Ruben Amorim's dismissal. The 50-year-old worked alongside Jose Mourinho at the club between 2016 and 2018, having previously been an integral part of the Portuguese tactician's backroom team at Porto, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan.",
      "During his time at United, Faria was instrumental in securing Europa League and League Cup trophies, but departed in 2018 to prioritise spending more time with his loved ones. Now in 2026, things at Old Trafford remain remarkably similar, with the club once again searching for a new manager in their quest to recapture past glories.",
      "Amorim's axing has divided opinion, with supporters weighing up the poor results against the requirement for stability and a coherent long-term strategy. Following that decision, Faria appears to have reignited the debate with an Instagram post containing his own words alongside a Manchester United crest.",
      "The message stated: \"A great club's philosophy used to be about silverware. Coaches were hired for their winning streaks in order to achieve the club objectives. Today, coaches are often hired according to their willingness to accept a club's business plan.",
      "\"Coaches are led to believe they're at the helm of a sports project in which they can manage their own decision-making while influencing different departments in order to achieve sporting success. The club's business plan, however, is essentially about numbers - with each department set up to achieve its own objectives, contesting any coaching decision that could hinder its own targets - regardless of on-field results.",
      "\"A winning football team is more than the sum of departmental parts and the setting of department-by-department objectives often comes at the cost of points and silverware won. Yet the coach still remains the face of an unsuccessful project - even when their power is reduced to almost nothing!\".",
      "This comes as Ineos, the minority stakeholders at Man United, face mounting questions about their handling of the club's footballing operations. Since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became involved at Old Trafford, there's been a deliberate push to revamp the sporting structure with top-tier personnel, creating a framework designed to maximise their resources in the transfer market.",
      "This has led to the appointments of Omar Berrada as CEO and Jason Wilcox as Director of Football within the senior management, with key decisions now flowing through them. They serve as the bridge between boardroom strategy and on-pitch performance, but following the difficulties surrounding Amorim as their first significant hire, doubts are emerging about their effectiveness and what lies ahead.",
      "At present, it seems that Man United will opt for a caretaker manager, as discussions are ongoing with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick about the position, before the next full-time appointment. While those talks continue, Darren Fletcher remains as the interim manager.",
      "The former midfielder took charge of Man United's 2-2 draw with Burnley in midweek and will be in the dugout for their FA Cup clash with Brighton. \"I have, and they informed me they'd like me to take the team for Sunday,\" Fletcher told the press when asked if he had spoken to the hierarchy about the Brighton game.",
      "\"I had the feeling that might be the case from Monday, but we wanted to focus on Burnley. So, I am tasked with leading the team on Sunday, and all my focus and energy goes into that.\"",
      "With United's early exit from the Carabao Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town, plus the chances of winning the Premier League looking more than unlikely, the FA Cup remains the last feasible hope of silverware this season. There will be some hope that, regardless of who is in the dugout, the club will make it into the fourth round.",
      "Amorim helped Man United overcome Arsenal and Leicester in last season's competition, before exiting at the fifth round stage to Fulham.",

As if being the manager of one of the world's biggest and most successful clubs isn't hard enough, the likes of Gary Neville, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand, Nicky Butt and more are influential in the media landscape.",
      "That means the top dog at United will be held to the standards they set during their careers and scrutinised swiftly and publicly when putting a foot wrong. However, the blunt criticisms was not a source of contention for Ruud van Nistelrooy during his caretaker reign at the club following Erik ten Hag's sacking.",
      "The former striker, who scored 150 goals in 219 games for the Red Devils, took charge of four United games before the permanent appointment of Ruben Amorim in November 2024.",
      "Winning three and drawing one of them, it was before the 1-1 draw against Chelsea at Old Trafford that Van Nistelrooy admitted that criticism from his former team-mates doesn't bother him.",
      "The Dutchman said: He said: \"I mean, we all do our jobs, don’t we? I think basically they care for the club, they want the club to do well and they are disappointed as well if it doesn’t go well with the club and have opinions on it.",
      "\"I think it’s absolutely fine and I don’t take it personal. When I see them I have a cup of coffee with them, and I don’t have any problems with that. I appreciate them as former colleagues, some of them I’m still in touch with, and that’s the path they choose. Others go and stay in football more on the football side, so, for me, it’s absolutely fine.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy admitted that the path to success for United - who have not won a Premier League or Champions League title for over a decade - will come but the fanbase must be patient.",
      "\"In football things can change, things can continue,\" he said in 2024. I don’t believe the hype that much. I don’t believe the drama that much. I know it’s the world we live in. For me, it’s important to stay calm, stay focused, do my job on a daily basis.",
      "\"I think that also has to be the case for this club. We’re not going to turn it around from today to tomorrow, but I think we’re going to get it done and I believe in that over the longer future.\"",
      "With Darren Fletcher at the helm, temporarily, the hunt for a new permanent boss is already underway and for their sake, it'll be one capable of handling the tenacity of the media that comes with being the leader of Manchester United.",

      "Gareth Southgate has already made it clear that he's not in a hurry to get back into football management. The ex-England manager has previously been linked with the Manchester United job and is once again among the rumoured contenders.",
      "The 55-year-old guided the Three Lions to two European Championship finals during his nearly eight-year tenure. Since stepping down from his role following England's loss to Spain in the Euro 2024 final, Southgate has remained out of management.",
      "United are on the hunt for a new head coach after parting ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this week, with plans to appoint an interim coach before announcing a permanent replacement in the summer. While Darren Fletcher is currently in caretaker charge, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a known admirer of Southgate's work with England.",
      "The Daily Star reported that the Three Lions boss was the favourite to replace then-United manager Erik ten Hag in March 2024. It was suggested that Southgate was Ratcliffe's first choice, with incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth also a fan of the England manager.",
      "When Amorim found himself under pressure earlier this season, Southgate was once again the subject of speculation. This led the former England boss to clarify his position on taking up a new role in November.",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Southgate said: \"I had an amazing time, obviously the great thing with England is that there's this higher purpose. I joined the FA to try and help English football become better, and to help youth development in particular.",
      "\"I somehow stumbled and ended up in the first-team manager's job and we had a pretty good period. I'm not desperate to stay in football. I've had 37 years in football which is amazing.\"",
      "When questioned about whether he might reconsider if a major opportunity arose, he responded: \"Well you can never say never because I've just seen Martin O'Neill at his age go to Celtic.",
      "\"But it's not something that's high on my agenda at the moment, I'm enjoying the work around leadership, I'm enjoying my work with young people, very determined to try and make a difference there. And so no, I'm very relaxed about not being in football at the moment.\"",
      "In October, reports emerged suggesting Southgate would require time and patience from the United hierarchy should he accept the role. The club's senior figures have faced mounting criticism following Amorim's final comments as United manager.",
      "Despite his impressive CV at international level, Southgate's experience as a Premier League manager remains limited. He previously managed Middlesbrough for three years, during which time the club suffered relegation to the Championship, before leaving in late 2009.",
      "Southgate's next role was as England U21 manager in 2013, a position he held until he was appointed as the senior team manager in September 2016. This means that Southgate has not managed a club side since October 2009.",
      "United legends Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have held discussions about taking over as interim manager for the rest of the season. Meanwhile, Fletcher took the reins for his first match as caretaker boss on Wednesday, guiding United to a 2-2 draw against Burnley.",
      "The 41-year-old, who is also being considered for the interim role, will get the opportunity to manage the team at Old Trafford this Sunday. United are poised to kick off their FA Cup campaign against Brighton, with the cup being the club's last realistic shot at securing a trophy this season.",

      "Ramsay has long been well regarded in England, largely due to his work in Manchester. He arrived at Carrington as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's final recruit as manager and retained his role through the tenures that saw Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag at the helm.",

      "Despite his abrupt dismissal from Manchester United in 2022, it's reported that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen on a return to Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday, leading the club's top brass to appoint Darren Fletcher as interim manager while they evaluate potential permanent replacements.",
      "However, the Norwegian could be in line to take the reins temporarily until the season's end, a role Solskjaer is reportedly eager to fill. While some might argue that bringing back the Baby Faced Assassin is a step in the wrong direction, there's no denying the affection Solskjaer holds for the club and continues to receive from supporters.",
      "A six-month stint at Old Trafford could see Solskjaer tasked with stabilising the team ahead of a new manager's arrival in the summer. However, with United vying for Champions League qualification and the FA Cup resuming this weekend, it could offer him a chance to leave his mark during his second tenure.",
      "Despite his sacking, Solskjaer remained a popular figure in the United dressing room, with his influence still very much felt. The 52-year-old could still make a significant impact, particularly if he decides to focus on two key areas, should he land the top job once more.",
      "Having spent 11 years playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, it's hardly surprising that Solskjaer is a staunch advocate of nurturing young talent, a fundamental part of United's ethos as a football club.",
      "Their youth record continues to astound fans to this day as the club have remarkably featured an academy graduate in every single first-team matchday squad since October 30, 1937. This streak has surpassed 4,000 consecutive games, a tradition Solskjaer upheld during his tenure.",
      "Solskjaer gave 16 club youngsters their first-team debuts, including Amad and Anthony Elanga. Amorim also handed debuts to Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey this season, providing a clear pathway for the youth to the first team, a key aspect of both Solskjaer and United's identity.",
      "Arguably, Man United's only overwhelmingly successful transfer since Ferguson's retirement in 2013 is Bruno Fernandes, who has been a game-changer since his arrival in 2020. With 309 appearances in the red shirt, he's netted 103 goals and provided 94 assists.",
      "While these impressive stats haven't translated into significant success, United fans would shudder to think where they would be without their Portuguese captain. That was a scenario that almost became a reality last summer when Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal reportedly tabled a £100million offer for the 31-year-old, which was turned down.",
      "In a recent interview, Fernandes confessed that he has contemplated leaving United and was upset by reports suggesting the club were willing to let him go. With Amorim's exit, Fernandes has now served under three permanent managers, and Solskjaer - the gaffer who brought Fernandes to Old Trafford - may have his work cut out persuading the captain not to pursue a lucrative move to the Middle East.",
      "Fernandes might be pleased with the return of his former manager, as he previously cited Solskjaer's faith in him as a key reason for joining the club. A challenging task could lie ahead for the ex-striker if Fernandes is considering a move away this summer.",

      "\"I spoke with Ole last Sunday before the game against Chelsea for almost two hours,\" Rangnick said after joining the club. \"He was very generous to spend, as I said, [more than] one-and-a-half hours on the phone with me, telling all his inside details about the team.\"",
      "Rangnick's tenure saw him win just 11 of his 29 matches in charge, with plans for him to move into a consultancy position ultimately abandoned. In contrast, Solskjaer had thrived as interim manager, securing 14 victories from 19 fixtures before being handed the role on a permanent basis.",
      "United are hoping their next appointment will spark a similar revival, having held discussions with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy regarding the position. When questioned in September 2024, Solskjaer had previously indicated he would be willing to return to the club.",
      "During a Q&A session at the Oslo Business Forum, the 52-year-old said: \"If the family [United] asks, I would say yes every day of the week. It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people [Erik ten Hag] have now, but I would say yes, of course.\"",
      "Following his departure from United, Solskjaer took a prolonged break from coaching. He was appointed Besiktas manager in January 2025 but was dismissed in August following a Europa Conference League play-off defeat to Swiss outfit Lausanne- Sport.",
      "Meanwhile, interim boss Fletcher will be looking to make his mark this weekend as the club prepare to take on Brighton in the FA Cup. The 41-year-old, who consulted Sir Alex Ferguson before accepting the position, will oversee his first match at Old Trafford on Sunday as the club seek to progress in the cup.",
      "In his first press conference as manager, Fletcher stated: \"I don't like to make any major decisions or things without speaking to Sir Alex and that's something I've done since I've been at the club and since I've left the club and everything I do.",
      "\"I've got a really good relationship with Sir Alex so he's probably the first person on the phone actually so I wanted to speak to him first. And ultimately, to get his blessing, to be perfectly honest with you, I think he deserves that respect.",
      "\"I wanted to run it by him, what he thought and he was supportive of it and he echoed my thoughts which I've always said. It's your job to do the best for Manchester United when you're an employee of the club. It's amazing when he says something that I try and live and believe every day, so it was comforting for me for him to say that.\"",

      "Manchester United's Sekou Kone is currently training with Lausanne Sport, hinting at a potential loan move for the second half of the season. Ineos-owned Lausanne already have Enzo Kana-Biyik on loan from United, and they could be looking to add Kone to their ranks for the rest of the campaign.",
      "Kone suffered a sickening eye socket fracture while playing for the Under-21s against Tamworth in August. He was sidelined for several months before making his return to the academy in November.",
      "The midfielder played a full match for the U21s against Borussia Dortmund at Old Trafford just before Christmas, setting him up for a potential loan move in the January transfer window. Kone has jetted off to Switzerland to train with Ineos-owned Lausanne ahead of a possible loan for the second half of the season.",
      "He is spending time with Lausanne to determine if the deal would be beneficial for both parties.",
      "Lausanne's manager, Peter Zeidler, recently told reporters: \"Yes, he's been with us for a few days, we know he's a good player and we've been watching him closely. He'll play with us on Thursday.",
      "\"He's with us, we can observe him closely, and we'll make a decision, just like we did last summer with Enzo Kana-Biyik, a very good young player who improved a lot in just a few months with us despite his early-season injury, and who also belongs to Manchester United.",
      "\"We saw his quality, particularly with his assist against Fiorentina. We have good experience with Enzo, so why not with Sekou Kone? But to say today whether he'll come, I don't know. It depends on several factors; we'll decide between January 15th and February 15th, as with all players.\"",
      "Kana-Biyik quietly joined Manchester during the summer transfer window, arriving on a free from French side Le Havre before heading straight out on a season-long loan to Lausanne.",
      "Kone would become the second United player sent on loan to Ineos-owned Lausanne should the switch get the go-ahead.",
      "Ruben Amorim included Kone in three Premier League matchday squads last term - for fixtures against Tottenham, Everton and Nottingham Forest - but the teenager is yet to make his first-team bow.",
      "The 19-year-old then jetted off to the USA for pre-season training, though he failed to feature in any matches.",
      "United forked out approximately £1million to bring Kone over from Malian outfit Guidars FC in August 2024.",

He has his critics, but I like what he's done at Newcastle. He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.",

      "Former Barcelona boss Xavi remains interested in taking a Premier League job following links with Manchester United. The Red Devils are on the lookout for a new face in the dugout after Ruben Amorim’s exit earlier this month.",
      "It appears that United are set to appoint an interim option for the time being, with former players Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher and Ruud van Nistelrooy all having emerged as potential options.",
      "But should they choose to go in a different direction, it appears that Xavi would be open to a move to Old Trafford. According to reports in Spain, the former midfielder is ready to return to management, having been out of work since May 2024.",
      "He is also keen on a switch to the Premier League, having only managed in Qatar and Spain. Xavi himself confirmed his desire to one day find a job in England.",
      "Speaking last year, he said: \"Of course? Where, I don't know. There's no hurry for me, but I'd like a good project. Like, 'You have four years to work and make a project.' I'd love to work in the Premier League because I love the passion there. In Spain, it's too much about the result.",
      "\"Or a national team, that would appeal. When I dreamed about being a coach, I dreamed about being in a World Cup or European Championship.”",
      "As it stands, United have had no contact with Xavi regarding a potential appointment but he could potentially become an option in the future. The 45-year-old kicked off his managerial career with Qatari side Al Sadd and was then appointed by former club Barcelona in November 2021.",
      "He went on to manage 142 games at the Camp Nou, winning the 2022/23 La Liga title to add to the eight league titles, three Spanish cups and four Champions League crowns he won as a player during his time with Barcelona.",

The Portuguese tactician was given his walking papers on Monday morning, with the Red Devils citing that the decision was made to give the club the \"best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher took the reins as interim head coach for United's league tie with Burnley on Wednesday, but considering the game finished in a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor, the board may be looking for someone a little more seasoned to take control until season's end, when they will properly assess their options.",
      "Both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have been linked with taking up a temporary position until May, with the club set to hold talks with both men this week. Whichever man is chosen for the task at hand may be offered the opportunity to reinforce the first-team this month.",
      "Scott McTominay has been linked with a sensational return to the north west after thriving in Napoli. The Scot joined the Serie A outfit in 2024, and helped Gli Azzurri clinch the league title in his maiden season.",
      "However, should Solskjaer be given the interim head coaching role at Old Trafford, he could advocate for the Red Devils to go back in for their academy graduate. Speaking about the midfielder in 2019, Solskjaer said: \"He's been excellent, and now that him and Fred work in a good relationship, work well together [sic] did that last season, PSG, when we had a few injuries and now as well they are working as a pair.",
      "\"Scotty's a leader, a Manchester United boy, you can see he's been a striker with the goal at Norwich on a half turn, but he's developing into a very good midfielder.\"",
      "It's clear that United are lacking in midfield at present, with Bruno Fernandes dropping into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro, whose future at the club beyond the current campaign is unknown. Elsewhere, Kobbie Mainoo has seen his game time limited as of late, while Manuel Ugarte looks to be nearing the exit.",
      "With all that in mind, McTominay could certainly be the exact player that the Premier League giants are lacking at present,. And with Solskjaer potentially at the wheel once again, it could certainly tempt the 29-year-old back to the club where he made a name for himself given their relationship.",
      "As per reports, Ajax have set their sights on snapping up Ugarte this month. A report from Dutch publication VI suggests that the Uruguayan is open to the idea of a move to the Eredivisie sensations after failing to make much of a mark in the Premier League.",
      "A loan deal looks the most viable option on Ajax's side until the end of the season, albeit, his reported weekly wage of £120,000 could prove problematic. It could also cause United to negotiate on the percentage of the salary which Ajax would be prepared to cover.",
      "Since making his way to Old Trafford from PSG in a £42.1million move in 2024, Ugarte has made 61 appearances across all competitions for Manchester United to date.",
      "As a result of impressing in Brazil, Manchester United are among a number of clubs who have been linked with 20-year-old midfielder, Breno Bidon. It is reported that Corinthians value the talent at around £26m this winter - a fee which could be alluring to the Red Devils considering their current woes in the engine room.",
      "However, securing the centre-mid may be far from smooth sailing for United, considering Arsenal and Sporting CP have also been linked with him.",

      "Following the match, Antonio Conte voiced his exasperation, stating: \"Hojlund's goal was disallowed because I don't know where he should have had that arm. We have to accept them and we accept them.\"",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport have reported that referee Simone Sozza and the VAR team have subsequently been suspended, despite the match decisions being 'deemed correct.'",
      "Napoli found themselves trailing 2-0 at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona before Scott McTominay reduced the deficit, with Giovanni Di Lorenzo ultimately salvaging a point in the 82nd minute.",
      "McTominay broke his longest Serie A scoring drought, a nine-match barren spell since arriving at Napoli in 2024, earning him the Man of the Match accolade.",
      "Conte acknowledged his team's underwhelming first-half display, whilst commending their resilience as the match unfolded.",
      "\"In the first half there were two negative episodes for us, we could have done better,\" the Italian manager added. \"On the penalty there was a somewhat peculiar assessment... But we accept it.",
      "\"These two episodes could kill anyone. In the second half we were good at putting our heads on our shoulders.",
      "\"We had the strength to score two goals, and that's what counts.\"",
      "Hojlund has netted six times and provided two assists in 14 Serie A outings this campaign, though he couldn't add to his tally on this occasion after having a goal disallowed.",
      "Napoli possess a €50million (£43.6m) option to make the transfer permanent when the loan concludes, which becomes mandatory if they secure Champions League qualification this season.",
      "Nevertheless, all signs point to Hojlund making the switch permanent irrespective of circumstances.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United supporters' group The 1958 have slammed the club's owners, chief executive Omar Berrarda and director of football Jason Wilcox, calling for a vote of no confidence. The group have announced plans for a protest against the United hierarchy that will take place before their fixture with Fulham on February 1.",
      "The group have criticised the management of Ruben Amorim's spell at Old Trafford, describing on-pitch performances as \"medicore\" and off-field operations as \"chaos\". Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been labelled an \"incompetent clown\" after his unsuccessful attempts to guide the club towards improvement.",
      "Amorim was dismissed by United on Monday, just hours after his furious comments following their 1-1 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road. Darren Fletcher has assumed control on an interim basis and managed the clash against Burnley, which ended 2-2, and will be in the dugout for the FA Cup third round match against Premier League opponents, Brighton.",
      "The protest adds further pressure on the Glazer family, Ratcliffe, and the revamped footballing operations team at the Theatre of Dreams. There is frustration amongst the supporters who believe they have been priced out, sidelined and treated as a nuisance.",
      "Supporters staged a demonstration at the conclusion of last season, ahead of the crucial fixture with Aston Villa, uniting to express their dissatisfaction with the football club following one of their most dismal campaigns in top-flight history",
      "They finished 15th in the Premier League and suffered defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Plans were initially in place to protest United's Premier League curtain-raiser against Arsenal, but these were abandoned following backlash over the decision to target Ratcliffe alongside the Glazers' stewardship of the club.",
      "Having postponed their demonstrations against the INEOS chief, next month's encounter with Marco Silva's outfit will mark the first chance for fans to express their discontent. Statements opposing the board have already started to surface, including during Wednesday's 2-2 stalemate at Turf Moor, where a banner was displayed in the away section declaring: \"Jim can't fix this.\"",
      "United are positioned just beyond the Champions League spots but squandered another chance to secure a top-four berth, with Benjamin Sesko's brace proving insufficient against Scott Parker's team.",
      "Amorim has encountered mounting scrutiny after being unable to reverse the declining form that ultimately resulted in Erik ten Hag's sacking. The former Sporting CP manager has presided over several nadir moments during his spell at the club, including a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two outfit Grimsby.",
      "A representative for The 1958 group expressed their concern, stating: \"It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.",
      "\"A manager has reportedly been dismissed not primarily for abject performances against Grimsby, Everton, West Ham, and Wolves, but allegedly for a heated exchange with Jason Wilcox. Wilcox a man with just nine months' experience as a Director of Football at Southampton is said to have attempted to interfere tactically, despite the club hiring Ruben fully aware of his rigid system. The situation beggar's belief.",
      "\"This decision was allegedly endorsed by Omar Berrada, a CEO with no prior experience in the role, listening to the complaints of a close ally rather than exercising independent leadership. We are once again witnessing Manchester United being run by executives learning on the job, at the expense of results, stability, and credibility.",
      "\"Let us be clear: this is not a defence of Ruben or the football served up under him. Much of it was unacceptable. But his dismissal once again exposes the continued dysfunction at our club. Manchester United is now a toxic partnership where fans are getting the worst of both worlds.",
      "\"WE CALL FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE OWNERSHIP, BERRADA AND WILCOX.\"",
      "They stated: \"Earlier this season, we asked supporters if they wanted to protest. Many chose to give Ratcliffe time. That time has been squandered. The situation is undeniably worse. That is why we will protest at Fulham at home on Sunday 1st February.",
      "\"Manchester United is 150 years old. That proud history, built by generations of supporters, must be protected.",
      "\"If we do not act now, the club we pass on will be unrecognisable, stripped of its culture, its soul, and its people. \"This needs to be stopped. We must fight for our club.",
      "We must fight for fan culture before it is too late. If you knew you couldn't play tomorrow, how hard would you play today?",
      "\"For Ratcliffe and the Glazers the game is over. Time is up. We can take no more and urge as many fans as possible to join us in a massive protest.\"",

      "He secured a point in his opening game as United drew 2-2 with Burnley. Club chiefs are are still in the process of trying to find Amorim’s successor, with Fletcher potentially an interim option, while former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also in talks over a return.",
      "But whoever is in charge, Sesko is backing United to recover sooner rather than later due to the spirit in the changing room. Asked if the side has resilience, the Slovenian replied: \"Definitely.",

      "\"We just have to keep going, keep pushing, because I think we're great and, yeah, I believe that great things are coming.\"",

      "Speaking about his brace, Sesko added: \"It feels great because we created great chances, especially with those two goals. Great movements, great ball.",
      "\"With this kind of situation, we are showing what team we are, what we are capable of and, yeah, it's great for the future, obviously.\"",
      "And while Sesko is predicting big things for United, he has sent a demand to his teammates to now aim for victories as United attempt to rise from seventh in the Premier League standings.",
      "He said: “It feels obviously disappointing because I think we were fighting, we were giving our best, we were creating a lot of chances. Basically, the ball was two times in the net, like over the line, but the opponent just took it out.",
      "\"We're creating good chances. Unfortunately, we received two goals. We still get a draw, which is important, but now it's just up to us to try to focus on the details and try to win the next game.\"",

      "Former Manchester United defender Laurent Blanc claimed he was approached about taking the reins at Old Trafford in 2014. Rumours are rife over who will succeed Ruben Amorim at United after the Portuguese boss was relieved of his duties this week after a beleaguered tenure.",
      "Blanc is currently out of work after leaving Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League in September of last year. The Frenchman spent two seasons as a player with United from 2001 to 2003, winning the Premier League under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "After retiring, the 1998 World Cup winner ventured into management with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, where he won three Ligue 1 titles, and Bordeaux, where he also won the French top-flight. He also took charge of the French national team.",
      "The bookmakers' latest odds have now positioned Blanc as one of the candidates to take over at United, amongst many others. However, he could have had his chance to manage the club over a decade ago.",
      "The 60-year-old claimed he spoke to United about replacing David Moyes before Louis van Gaal was eventually appointed as manager.",
      "\"I had a call from a director, I'd prefer not to say who, and some discussion,\" Blanc told The Times in 2014, He added: \"But I was in Paris so it was very difficult for me to leave. We kept in touch but they went with Van Gaal in the end.\"",
      "Blanc was reportedly under consideration once more following Jose Mourinho's sacking by United in December 2019. However, United went on to appoint Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as caretaker manager, with the Norwegian being given the job on a permanent basis before being sacked himself in November 2021.",
      "While perhaps it's unlikely that Blanc is in the frame for the job this time around he did underline his intentions to one day manage in the Premier League.",
      "\"Managing in England is a big ambition,\" he said in 2014. \"I have big experience at Paris. \"It's difficult for me to go to another club in France. I want a different challenge in England, Spain or Italy. I played in those countries, I know them, so I keep going to games and I see what calls come in.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher has been named as interim boss of United but it's Solskjaer and Carrick who are the hot favourites to take the job on an temporary basis.",
      "Other names tipped for the job and joining Blanc on the long list include Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner. Ex-Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who stepped down as the Blues head coach on New Years' Day, and Barcelona legend Xavi have also been linked to the job.",
      "Amorim was appointed to replace Erik ten Hag as United manager in November 2024. He oversaw a miserable debut campaign with United finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Amorim left the club having won just 24 of his 63 matches in charge. A club statement said \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",

Sources in Turkey claim that Kayserispor have agreed terms with United to sign the winger, and that he has already been seen sporting the training kit for his new club.",
      "Mather will sign for an undisclosed fee, joining Kayserispor's training camp in Antalya ahead of their games against Besiktas, Istanbul Basaksehir and Galatasaray. The local academy star was tied down to United until 2027, but sought a transfer elsewhere to boost his senior career.",
      "New reports have suggested that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is open to returning to United on a temporary basis after engaging in talks this week. Fabrizio Romano reports that the ex-United striker is considering another run at Old Trafford, three years after he was sacked as manager in November 2021.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are among the former United players to hold talks with the club over the managerial position.",
      "Follow Fletcher's press conference in the live blog below...",
      "The Manchester United hierarchy are not planning to discuss who will be the next manager with former boss Sir Alex Ferguson, as they look for their next permanent replacement for Ruben Amorim. The Mirror report that both the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe are not looking to get the legendary manager's input on the next hire. It comes as Man United announced an end to Amorim's 14-month reign at Old Trafford earlier this week, citing that it was the 'right time to make a change' for the highest possible finish in the Premier League.",

      "Exeter City's manager Gary Caldwell asked his former Scotland teammate and Manchester United interim head coach Darren Fletcher to aid in the Grecians' preparation for their FA Cup third round match against Manchester City this Saturday. Caldwell, who shares a strong bond with the 41-year-old, reached out to Fletcher following the draw. He asked if the League One club could use United's Carrington training base before heading to the Etihad Stadium. When the request was made, Fletcher was serving as the Under-18s head coach at Old Trafford. However, he has since stepped into the caretaker role with the Reds after Ruben Amorim's dismissal on Monday.",

While his first crack at the job started well enough, particularly when he was interim head coach, things soon deteriorated. By the end of his spell, fans had turned on the club legend with the away end at Vicarage Road making their feelings clear after a pathetic defeat to Watford. Bruno Fernandes leapt to the defence of Solskjaer that afternoon but the damage was done and the Norwegian was gone.",
      "Ralf Rangnick delivered some home truths during his interim spell in charge but Erik ten Hag could only do so much. Ruben Amorim tried to implement the 'open heart surgery' that Rangnick diagnosed after Solskjaer's first spell but his stubbornness and livewire nature brought his tenure to a premature end.",

Imagine if someone had told you that when Ruben Amorim was appointed, he would last just 14 months and Solskjaer would be hired as his interim successor for the rest of the season. Football tends to surprise. It's been a whirlwind week in Manchester following the sudden decision to sack Amorim, and it would be an incredible story if Solskjaer lands the interim gig.",

The suggestion is that it might be Solskjaer or Carrick who gets the job - not the pair together. Carrick was United caretaker for three matches when Solskjaer was sacked in 2021.

United had looked good value for a victory after Sesko's brace but poor defending cost them. Whether this weekend will be Fletcher's second and final game in interim charge of United remains to be seen.",

Carrick and Solskjaer would both be capable interims, however, as they have previous coaching experience with the club and would likely inspire an upturn in results by implementing a different system.",

The 52-year-old departed on good terms when he was sacked, despite being booed at Vicarage Road after his final game in charge, but there are pros and cons to his possible return, which must be considered by decision-makers.",

      "The positives about Solskjaer's potential return are that he is almost guaranteed to enjoy a new manager bounce (he won 14 from 19 games as interim in 2018/2019), he would improve morale and he would play a formation that would chime with the players.",
      "The cons are that appointing Solskjaer is the kind of decision the previous regime would make, the end of the Norwegian's tenure at United was brutal, and what happens if he does well as interim boss? Would they dare to give him the job on a permanent basis again? United are still well-positioned to secure European football, and Solskjaer could possibly steer the club back into the Champions League.",
      "It would be difficult not to give Solskjaer the job on a permanent basis if he secured Champions League football. His position would be strengthened, and fans could be lulled into giving him another proper bite at the cherry.",
      "United's decision-making was influenced by fan pressure after the FA Cup final success in 2024, with Ineos deciding to extend Erik ten Hag's contract despite the overwhelming evidence to sack him.",
      "The pressure from fans, and Solskjaer's allies in the media, would be even bigger to give him the job permanently if the Norwegian had a strong impact. The Ineos hierarchy has shown they are capable of making such errors of judgement, and they appear to take notice of external noise.",
      "\"If people can't handle the Gary Nevilles or any other criticism, we need to change the club,\" said Amorim during an explosive final press conference, suggesting that Jason Wilcox and co had been influenced by comments in the media, so just imagine what Neville would say if Solskjaer did well as interim.",
      "The condition for Solskjaer's potential return should be that he won't be given the job permanently, regardless of what he achieves as interim. No elite club would hire Solskjaer on a permanent basis in 2026.",

      "Darren Fletcher gave a huge thumbs up to Benjamin Sesko when Manchester United equalised against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday. Then Fletcher was beaming when Sesko scored to make it 2-1.",
      "In 10 minutes, Sesko scored as many goals in Lancashire as he had managed in his first four months in England, finally looking like the striker United thought they were signing from RB Leipzig. Sesko looked like he fancied it. His movement was sharp and he forced a spectacular save from Martin Dubravka in the first half when he sent a powerful header from the edge of the box goalbound.",
      "Sesko scored an impressive brace in the second half. The Slovenia international's equaliser was well-taken, but the second goal was even better, as the cross was wonderful and he volleyed into the net.",
      "The striker recorded seven shots on target against Burnley and would have been disappointed not to have scored a hat-trick. However, Sesko must take the positives from his performance against the Clarets because it was the type of display that should provide him with encouragement.",
      "Sesko after scoring at Turf Moor.(Image: )",
      "“The positive is Sesko scoring. Hopefully he gets some confidence,\" Sherwood said. \"It’s taken him six months to turn up, but I’m pleased for him. He’s had a tough run and I’d have had him off the pitch at half-time never to wear a Manchester United shirt again. I stand by what I said.",
      "\"He’s not good enough to play for Manchester United. He’s turned up for one game against Burnley, who are going to get relegated. Hopefully we start seeing something different from him.”",
      "Sherwood's criticism of Sesko at half-time was objectively harsh, but his comments at the end of the game were outright strange. Sesko finally looked like a United striker against Burnley, and yet Sherwood said he stood by his comments.",
      "Perhaps Sherwood was afraid of changing his mind and appearing to lack conviction. The truth is, having the ability to reflect and change opinion in the light of new evidence is a strength.",
      "There have been performances from Sesko this season that have certainly been worthy of criticism. He was signed for €76.5million (£66.4m), plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, and hasn't scored as many as he would have hoped, but his performance against Burnley was a step in the right direction.",
      "Sherwood should have been level-headed and constructive with his analysis. He is entitled to his opinion, but pundits have a duty to articulate criticism in a professional manner on TV.",
      "Sesko is working hard to become a success at United. Sherwood should probably make the same effort to become a better pundit.",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Darren Fletcher knows Exeter City boss Gary Caldwell from their time with the Scotland national team(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Exeter City's manager Gary Caldwell asked his former Scotland teammate and Manchester United interim head coach Darren Fletcher to aid in the Grecians' preparation for their FA Cup third round match against Manchester City this Saturday. Caldwell, who shares a strong bond with the 41-year-old, reached out to Fletcher following the draw.",
      "He asked if the League One club could use United's Carrington training base before heading to the Etihad Stadium. When the request was made, Fletcher was serving as the Under-18s head coach at Old Trafford. However, he has since stepped into the caretaker role with the Reds after Ruben Amorim's dismissal on Monday.",
      "Despite the change, Exeter flew to Manchester on Thursday afternoon following a training session at their Cliff Hill training complex. They stayed overnight in Manchester and will complete their final preparations for the FA Cup third round tie at Carrington on Friday.",
      "\"I phoned Darren Fletcher a few weeks ago and kind of asked him if we could do that and we're really thankful to him and Manchester United for allowing us to train there,\" Caldwell revealed. \"But he's got a bit busier since.\".",
      "\"I am delighted for him to take the (United) team, it's an incredible honour for him. He's a brilliant person and we thank him for allowing to train there.",
      "\"I hope to see him, but I think he'll be quite busy preparing for his own FA Cup tie (against Brighton and Hove Albion on Sunday) but it's great that we can do that. I think the players will enjoy that experience as well and to travel today, I think, helps us. We've had some horrendous journeys up north this season, to do that on a Friday is really, really difficult, so to do it today and allow us to rest and recover tomorrow is very good.\"",
      "For the Exeter squad, stepping onto the Etihad Stadium pitch will be a memorable occasion, but training at Carrington will be equally significant. With several United supporters among the Exeter players, the experience will only enhance what promises to be an unforgettable weekend for the Exeter squad, whatever the outcome.",
      "\"It's a tour of Manchester,\" midfielder Reece Cole added. \"It will be nice to go and see facilities of an elite team's training ground and to go and train there will be really good.",
      "\"I think it's nice the way we've done it. We've travelled up two days before and we can really knuckle down and focus on what we need to do. It'll be another great experience going to see and training at Man United's training ground.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's departure as United head coach was confirmed on Monday, with the Reds now looking to appoint a successor in the near future. Darren Fletcher is currently in interim charge and recently oversaw the 2-2 draw with Burnley.",
      "Former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has already been linked with a return to Old Trafford, with speculation that an appointment would be a caretaker role until the end of the season. Michael Carrick is alongside him as one of the frontrunners to come in.",
      "A permanent appointment is expected to be announced at the end of the season, with several names linked to it. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has been labelled an early favourite, though Eddie Howe has recently been tipped to take over",
      "Stay here for all of the latest throughout the day, around the appointment of a new manager.",
      "PSG sporting director Luis Campos has rebuffed claims that Luis Enrique has rejected the chance to stay at the club beyond this summer.",
      "Marca recently suggested that Enrique is refusing to extend his contract in Paris and is keen on a new challenge. The Man United job has emerge as a potential move.",
      "However, speaking to Canal+, Campos has played those rumours down, claiming it was \"100% fake news.\"",
      "Roy Keane has blamed Man United's downfall on Sir Alex Ferguson for 'hanging on like a bad smell'.",
      "It comes after Darren Fletcher admitted he was asked for Ferguson's blessing, despite his retirement in 2013. \"What happens in these job interviews? I'm intrigued,\" he said. \"Why do they keep giving certain people a job? What happens in the interview that they sit there and go, and 12, 14 months later, \"he's not the guy for us.\"",
      "'Do you not suss that out when you speak to them? You look somebody in the eye and go... You see who's making the decisions at Manchester United... you still have [Alex] Ferguson and David Gill [former chief executive] hanging on like a bad smell.",
      "'Who's making the decisions? [Sir Jim] Ratcliffe, [Jason] Wilcox? Who's coming into this interview process, you're speaking to a manager, you get a feel for somebody and go \"he's the guy for us?\"",
      "'Almost forget the CV. You need something on our CV, of course, that you've won a trophy or managed a long time. But you've got to look somebody in the eye and go \"are you the man to get us places?\"",
      "On the latest Rest is Football podcast, Gary Lineker asked the question whether Manchester United could still attract a world-class manager, given their recent struggles.",
      "Micah Richards said: “I still think they’ll want the job. As a manager, you’ll always think you can turn it round.",
      "\"I think the key question will be, ‘Do you have full control? Are you a coach, or are you a manager? Do you get to pick the players that you want? Are you having people above you meddling with what you want to do on the pitch?'",
      "\"If you have full control, 100 per cent.”",
      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has revealed that Newcastle United's Eddie Howe would be his number one candidate to become the new head coach at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Do I think it's the right or wrong answer? I don't know. If it's until the end of the season, I think Ole would do alright. Do I see Ole as the manager for the next four or five seasons, getting United back competing, then probably not.\"",
      "\"I know he's not for everyone, he'll have his critics but I like what he's done at Newcastle and Bournemouth, he's managed 700 to 800 games, he's still a young man. I love his calmness, I think sometimes Man United need a bit of that.",
      "\"We've seen the previous manager going in - I like people with emotion, obviously I'm quite an emotional person - but I think his calmness, what he's done at Newcastle, Champions League a couple of times, winning the (League) Cup. I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",

      "Manchester United have been told why Roy Keane would be the perfect interim manager. Gary Pallister would love to see Keane given the job on an interim basis, as he believes his former team-mate would not only 'command respect' from players but also have no hesitation in calling those who are underperforming out.",
      "“Roy’s a big name and a legend – but so was Bryan Robson, and he never got the chance to manage United even though he was in the management game for a period of time,” he said via Hard Rock Bet.",
      "“Roy’s dipped in and out of management and made his name as an outspoken pundit now. He’s good value when you see him on the TV. He’d certainly command respect in the dressing room and shape it up, I have no doubt about that.",
      "“But with what has gone on with Roy, I’m not sure. Maybe if it was seven or eight years ago, you would’ve thought of it as a possible chance, but he’s been out of management for a long time and has been very critical of United publicly.\"",
      "Hello and welcome to today's coverage of Man United's hunt for a new head coach.",
      "We will hear from Darren Fletcher today ahead of the weekend's FA Cup clash with Brighton. We'll bring you the latest news on the hunt for an appointment for the rest of the season.",
      "Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers speaks very fondly of Michael Carrick, describing him as a manager who stood out during the early stages of his career. Carrick is one of the contenders to take interim charge at Manchester United, alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Both coaches previously worked together at Old Trafford, with Carrick forming part of Solskjaer's backroom team. While there are plenty of questions about who might be best suited for the role, Rogers has already given his own verdict on Carrick.",
      "When Darren Fletcher was announced as the interim head coach of Manchester United, there was an immediate expectation that the Scot would make changes when he took charge of the Reds for the trip to Burnley. The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",
      "Changing their defensive shape was almost a guarantee considering the issues raised with Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back system. Amorim's most fatal failing was persisting with his preferred formation when all the signs showed it couldn't be done with the players available.",
      "After a 2-2 draw to struggling Burnley, the jury remains firmly out on whether the back four will make United noticeably better in the long term. However, another change Fletcher made has brought about instant results for the Reds.",
      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure.",
      "Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss. But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed by a club in crisis one year ago, before lifting them from seventh to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig. He pulled off a memorable Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and beat their arch city rivals, Galatasaray, to retain a proud club milestone.",
      "Manchester United are preparing for an FA Cup third-round match against Brighton while simultaneously searching the transfer market for new players and a manager. The Red Devils recently parted ways with Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge, with Darren Fletcher stepping in as caretaker manager.",
      "Speculation continues to circulate about who will take over the managerial reins, whether on a temporary or permanent basis. The incoming boss will undoubtedly need to bolster the squad as United strive for a top finish in the Premier League this season.",
      "Currently positioned seventh in the league following a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday evening, United's next challenge is the Manchester derby in the Premier League. However, their immediate focus is on Brighton in the FA Cup, a team that managed a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Monday.",
      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "Darren Fletcher will be back in the dugout for Manchester United on Sunday, when they play host Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup third round.",
      "It comes as the club continue their search to appoint a new head coach following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man United winger Patrick Dorgu has insisted that Amorim was wrong to claim he had been playing nervously.",
      "\"I don’t think those were the words he was looking for,\" he said. \"But I don’t agree that I’ve been nervous.",
      "\"But I do agree that I haven’t played as well as I have with the national team. I haven’t been lying at home and being angry that he has criticised me.\"",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Tottenham are interested in 46‑year‑old Italian manager Roberto De Zerbi, though he is believed to favour a move to Man United instead.",
      "It is said that De Zerbi views the Manchester United job as a 'dream opportunity' to manage the club. Although he is under contract at Marseille until the summer of 2027, he is reportedly open to leaving this summer if the right offer arrives, believing he has 'taken the French club as far as he can.'",
      "Scott McTominay's prospects of returning to Man United could be enhanced if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reinstated as manager. The club legend is rumoured to be in line for a potential comeback as interim boss following the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday.",
      "Speculation suggests it's a toss-up between Solskjaer and Michael Carrick to temporarily helm the club for the remainder of this season. It might be overly optimistic to expect a deal of McTominay's scale to be finalised this month, however, despite the pressing need for dynamism in midfield.",
      "In a 2019 assessment of the player, the Norwegian said: \"He's been excellent, and now that him and Fred work in a good relationship, work well together [sic] did that last season, PSG, when we had a few injuries and now as well they are working as a pair. Scotty's a leader, a Manchester United boy, you can see he's been a striker with the goal at Norwich on a half turn, but he's developing into a very good midfielder.\"",
      "McTominay's debut campaign in Italy read like something from a fairy tale, transforming from Old Trafford outcast to Serie A's Most Valuable Player in less than 12 months.",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure. Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss.",
      "But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit. \"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Bayazit admits Solskjaer's style of play wasn't easy on the eye but it was case of needs must at the time. He said: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad. The football was, at times, decent but never scintillating to watch. They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games. I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs. I don't think he should have got sacked when he did. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Fletcher arrived at Turf Moor dressed in a Paul Smith club suit, continuing the trend of former United players-turned caretaker managers wearing a suit and tie on the touchline. The outfit choice comes from playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, who believed United representatives should dress smartly.",
      "The 41-year-old asked Ferguson for his 'blessing' to manage United against Burnley, and he carried himself with class at the pre-match press conference, shaking the hands of journalists. Fletcher should have his head held high if Burnley is the only league game he oversees as interim boss.",
      "He behaved like a United manager should before and after the clash at Turf Moor - which counts for something.",
      "It took just eight minutes for the away section to begin a rendition of 'you are my Solskjaer, my Ole Solskjaer', which felt like a seal of approval for the Norwegian's increasingly likely return. Solskjaer left on good terms in 2021, despite being booed after his final game in charge against Watford, and the club's press release announcing his sacking said: \"He will forever be welcome back.\"",
      "The 52-year-old will always be popular among fans due to his playing career, but some supporters have mixed feelings about a possible return. Those reservations are merited. The end of Solskjaer's tenure should not be forgotten, although there were positives from his stint.",
      "Carrick was part of Solskjaer's backroom staff, and he is also in contention for the job. The away fans gave Carrick their approval by signing: \"He's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes.\"",
      "It remains to be seen who will be given the interim job for the remainder of the season.",
      "Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers speaks very fondly of Michael Carrick, describing him as a manager who stood out during the early stages of his career.",
      "The Villa star spent the 2023/24 season playing under Carrick at Middlesbrough and has highlighted the influence that short spell had on his career.",
      "\"Michael Carrick, he was the coach that spoke to me away from football,\" Rogers said. \"There was always a line of communication with him which I thought was vital at that time. I still speak to him now.",
      "\"I had a difficult three years going out on loan before Middlesbrough, but I don't think I'd be the player I am now without the experiences. It gave me the toughness to go through adversity, helped me grow up and learn about myself and what I needed to improve. At that time, I wasn't ready.\"",

      "The Mirror report that both the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe are not looking to get the legendary manager's input on the next hire.",
      "It comes as Man United announced an end to Amorim's 14-month reign at Old Trafford earlier this week, citing that it was the 'right time to make a change' for the highest possible finish in the Premier League.",
      "While Darren Fletcher is in place as interim head coach, talks are ongoing with the likes of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick over taking the role as caretaker until the end of the season - giving the hierarchy time to make a thorough decision on the next permanent hire in the summer.",
      "Current names on the United shortlist include Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti, and Mauricio Pochettino - all of whom could be available as part of a large managerial shuffle in the summer, following their World Cup duties with their respective national teams.",
      "There will be plenty for CEO Omar Berrada and Director of Football Jason Wilcox to ponder over with their next appointment, given the mixed reception to the exit of Amorim and questions over the long-term direction of the club.",
      "This is now the seventh permanent manager United are looking to hire since Ferguson's retirement back in 2013, with no clear indication on who could be the next through the door to try and bring back the success the legendary manager brought them.",
      "The 84-year-old won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups, and two Champions League titles, on top of many other honours in his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Ferguson has often been viewed as a figure that Man United need to emulate, but given their struggles on the pitch, it has been tough for any manager to stay in post long enough to bring that level of success.",
      "His presence still looms large, even though Ineos terminated his contract as a global ambassador for the club back in 2024 as part of a wider-scale cutback on costs.",
      "Fletcher made keen reference to Ferguson when taking over the role as interim head coach, when he said to the press: \"I don't like to make any major decisions without speaking to Sir Alex.",
      "Darren Fletcher took charge of Manchester United for the first time earlier this week in the 2-2 draw with Burnley(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",

      "While his influence over Fletcher and his role were clear, former captain Roy Keane is less than keen when it comes to the presence Ferguson still has around Man United.",
      "\"Who is making the decisions? Ratcliffe, Wilcox? Who is going into the interview process, getting a feeler for them and saying, 'this is the guy for us'.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a leading candidate to become Manchester United interim manager(Image: Arif Hudaverdi Yaman/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Rivals fans are already preparing their memes in anticipation of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer returning to Manchester United for a second stint in the dugout. While his first crack at the job started well enough, particularly when he was interim head coach, things soon deteriorated.",
      "By the end of his spell, fans had turned on the club legend with the away end at Vicarage Road making their feelings clear after a pathetic defeat to Watford. Bruno Fernandes leapt to the defence of Solskjaer that afternoon but the damage was done and the Norwegian was gone.",
      "Ralf Rangnick delivered some home truths during his interim spell in charge but Erik ten Hag could only do so much. Ruben Amorim tried to implement the 'open heart surgery' that Rangnick diagnosed after Solskjaer's first spell but his stubbornness and livewire nature brought his tenure to a premature end.",
      "Proof, if it was needed, that time heals all wounds, Solskjaer is now in the running to return to Old Trafford to see the Reds through until the end of the campaign. Whether his second spell as an interim can work as well as his first remains to be seen.",
      "However, if you are Benjamin Sesko, you should be desperate for Solskjaer to come on board to navigate the remainder of the season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was back among the goals for Manchester United on Wednesday night(Image: )",
      "The world's best striker at this moment is Erling Haaland and it has been well-documented how much the Manchester City star credits Solskjaer for helping his development. Speaking about their time together at Molde, Haaland said in 2020: \"Solskjaer and I did some practice on finishing. Not just crosses. I remember he taught me some easy rules.",
      "\"The first one was one-touch [finishes]. That I don’t use too much power and trying to destroy the goal or the goalie with ball. I think that I was thinking about doing that and it was something new that he told me. I trained a bit on that, but without scoring. But at least I had it in my head after that training session.",
      "\"He has taught me a lot to be calm, and also be on your toes and come to those situations where the ball is coming. It is then you have the chance to score. He deserves a lot of credit for teaching me that.\"",
      "If Solskjaer wants to take on a new prodigy, Sesko would be the perfect student. His two goals against Burnley show that he has what it takes to make it Old Trafford. Having someone like Solskjaer to gain advice from and ask questions to is invaluable.",
      "Sesko should be hoping Solskjaer is appointed.",

      "Casemiro arrived detached from the squad.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Casemiro was a straggler when Manchester United arrived at Turf Moor. He was detached at the back of the group as the players entered the ground, and he was off the pace throughout the game.",
      "The Brazilian delivered the kind of performance that proves why United must allow him to leave this summer and resist the temptation to extend his deal after a decent run of form at the start of the campaign.",
      "Casemiro was a passenger for both Burnley goals. The 33-year-old looked like he should have been playing walking football, rooted to the ground as Burnley passed around him.",
      "\"We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again,\" explained Darren Fletcher during his post-match press conference. Casemiro was part of the problem in Lancashire.",
      "In mid-November, United had conceded just five goals when he had been on the pitch, and 15 when he had been off it, but it was always going to be impossible for Casemiro to sustain that level of form.",
      "Casemiro will celebrate his 34th birthday next month. He deserves huge credit for even creating a conversation about whether to extend his deal when it should have been cut and dry, but the decision on his future is obvious: United must cut ties with Casemiro and bid him farewell at the end of the season.",
      "United have the option to extend Casemiro's contract by 12 months, which some have suggested makes sense, however, that would mean he would continue to be the highest earner in the dressing room. It would be an Ed Woodward-esque decision to extend Casemiro's deal, although the events of the last week show Ineos' leadership has more in common with their predecessors than they would admit.",
      "Casemiro in action at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "You wouldn't put it past United's hierarchy to make that decision, but they will allow Casemiro to run down his contract if they have any sense. Ruben Amorim's sacking may also influence the decision.",
      "Amorim was an advocate of Casemiro after initially overlooking him following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon. Last month, Amorim was asked whether there was an update on the contracts of Casemiro and Harry Maguire, and he said: \"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do.",
      "\"We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing. So we have so much to do at this moment. We are not thinking about that. We will just think about the next game.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he would like to keep both players for next season and responded: \"I'm really happy with them, but I don't know what is going to happen, so we will see what will happen until the end of the season, what position we will be, and then we will see.\"",
      "Discussing whether the uncertainty could impact Casemiro's form, Amorim said: \"It's not that situation, I'm not saying whether he is staying or not. Then when I see Casemiro training, if everyone trained like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in set-piece training.",
      "\"Even when they are playing 10 versus the goalkeeper and the movement that he makes. Imagine in the game, we will be a top team. If everybody works like Casemiro. And when I say work, it's not just about the running, it's the focus, and you can understand why that guy won five Champions Leagues.",
      "\"If you pay attention to everything that he does, with contract or with no contract, he's a top player.\"",
      "Amorim and Casemiro were allies.(Image: 2025 Getty Images)",
      "Amorim spoke warmly about Casemiro's work ethic and quality, to the extent that he gave the impression that the midfielder's deal could be extended under certain conditions.",
      "Casemiro lost a major ally when United announced Amorim's sacking at the beginning of the week, although he was not one of the players who thanked Amorim on social media when his exit was confirmed. The former Real Madrid midfielder posted \"we fought but couldn't get the first win of the year\" to his 22 million followers on Instagram after drawing with Leeds last weekend.",
      "United sources believe Amorim intentionally orchestrated his sacking during that post-match press conference. Casemiro wouldn't have been pleased to see a manager who trusted him walking out the door.",
      "Casemiro will also be out the exit door in a few months, provided United make the right decision.",

      "Rui Faria, the former assistant at Manchester United, has posted a cryptic message following Ruben Amorim's sacking(Image: (Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images))",
      "Former Manchester United assistant manager Rui Faria has potentially stirred the pot on the situation at the club with a cryptic post on social media, following Ruben Amorim's sacking.",
      "The 50-year-old was part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff at Old Trafford from 2016 until 2018, having been a key member of the Portuguese manager's staff at Porto, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan beforehand.",
      "Faria helped Man United win the Europa League and the EFL Cup, but he eventually left in 2018, resigning from his position to spend more time with his family.",
      "Fast forward to 2026, and the situation at Old Trafford hasn't changed much, as the club look to get back towards the glory days with another change of manager.",
      "The sacking of Amorim has been met with some mixed reception, as many balance the results on the pitch with the need for a long-term plan and some stability.",
      "After that move, Faria may well have stirred the pot again with a post on Instagram, which featured some quotes from himself with a Manchester United badge in the background.",
      "The post reads: \"A great club's philosophy used to be about silverware. Coaches were hired for their winning streaks in order to achieve the club objectives. Today, coaches are often hired according to their willingness to accept a club's business plan.",
      "\"Coaches are led to believe they're at the helm of a sports project in which they can manage their own decision-making while influencing different departments in order to achieve sporting success.",
      "\"The club's business plan, however, is essentially about numbers - with each department set up to achieve its own objectives, contesting any coaching decision that could hinder its own targets - regardless of on-field results.",
      "\"A winning football team is more than the sum of departmental parts and the setting of department-by-department objectives often comes at the cost of points and silverware won.",
      "\"Yet the coach still remains the face of an unsuccessful project - even when their power is reduced to almost nothing!\"",
      "It comes at a time when Ineos, part owners of Man United, have also come under scrutiny while they handle the sporting side of the club.",
      "Since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's involvement at Old Trafford, there has been a clear plan to overhaul the sporting department with best in class employees, with a structure that can make more of what they have in the market.",
      "That has seen the introduction of Omar Berrada as CEO and Jason Wilcox as the Director of Football to the hierarchy, with decisions delegated from the pair.",
      "They are the link between plans from the hierarchy and success on the pitch, but given the struggled with Amorim as the first major appointment, questions are now being raised over their role and what is next.",
      "For now, it appears as though Man United will go with a caretaker manager, as talks continue with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick over the role, before the next permanent appointment.",

      "Kone suffered a fractured eye socket playing for the Under-21s against Tamworth in August. He was ruled out for a few months and returned to action for the academy in November.",

      "“He’s with us, we can observe him closely, and we’ll make a decision, just like we did last summer with Enzo Kana-Biyik, a very good young player who improved a lot in just a few months with us despite his early-season injury, and who also belongs to Manchester United.",
      "“We saw his quality, particularly with his assist against Fiorentina. We have good experience with Enzo, so why not with Sekou Kone? But to say today whether he’ll come, I don’t know. It depends on several factors; we’ll decide between January 15th and February 15th, as with all players.”",
      "Kana-Biyik was a low-key arrival in Manchester in the summer window, arriving on a free transfer from French club Le Havre before immediately joining Lausanne on a season-long loan.",
      "Kone could be the second United player to be loaned to Ineos-owned Lausanne if the move is given the green light.",
      "Ruben Amorim named Kone in three Premier League matchday squads last season - against Tottenham, Everton and Nottingham Forest - without giving him his debut for the club. The 19-year-old subsequently travelled to the USA for pre-season, but he didn't make a single appearance.",
      "United paid around £1million to sign Kone from Malian club Guidars FC in August 2024.",

      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "\"It's a good question,\" he said. \"My experience is only tonight, so I experienced that. We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again. We sat in a little bit and maybe we should have gone for the kill and gone for the third goal.",
      "\"It all happened very quickly as well, so I've not had chance to reflect on that yet. So that's something that we'll try and look at, but it's a little bit new just now. It's a little bit fresh, so it's probably going to take a little bit of time to sit back and reflect on the game, watch it back and then try and figure out why these things keep happening.\"",
      "Fletcher added: \"I think you can get in that cycle with a little bit of confidence. I think in terms of like, there's a little bit of a feeling that can you see the game out or can you go on and win it and that's not deemed to be there yet.",
      "\"And that can only build through time and confidence and actually winning some football games and finding out what it takes to win games. Sometimes you might put in a good performance but you've got to find a way to win ugly and see out a match and it might not be pretty.",
      "\"That may be from keeping the ball, that may be from defending deep as a team, whatever that is. But the team need to figure out how to put in performances that win them games and then hopefully from there that confidence can grow.\"",

      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "After his final game in charge at Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was offering a more nuanced view of the only natural striker in his squad, but the bare facts said it all: Sesko had just two goals in 17 appearances under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "He doubled that tally in 90 minutes under Darren Fletcher. Jason Wilcox looked sheepish in the stands all night, with his own role as director of football in the spotlight, but this was a good night for those who backed the decision to sign Sesko over Watkins.",
      "His two goals were superbly taken and he had eight shots in total. It was by some distance his best performance in a United shirt and it came a day after a heart-to-heart with Fletcher. The 41-year-old Scot sat the striker down at Carrington on Tuesday and boosted his confidence with a video that showed his strengths.",
      "He highlighted his movement and reassured him that he was on the right path. A day later he scored twice after making the right runs and getting on the same wavelength as his teammates.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher. \"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well.",
      "\"Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities. I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"He had a few other opportunities there, another snapshot. It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive from the night really is his two goals.\"",

      "Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher has confirmed the team's tactical approach will be \"fluid\" against Burnley tonight. United are set to take on Burnley in the Premier League, just two days after Ruben Amorim's sacking amid rising tensions with the Old Trafford hierarchy.",
      "Fletcher has been appointed on an interim basis and Burnley could be his only game in charge, with talks having taken place with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week. The former midfielder has made just one change from the draw with Leeds, recalling Fernandes to the starting team at the expense of Leny Yoro, and Fletcher is expected to play with four at the back.",
      "Speaking to MUTV about the team's tactical approach, Fletcher said: \"Tactics are fluid in and out of possession. We want movement, we want rotation, we have to exploit the spaces the opponents give you.",
      "\"But the players are the ones who cross the white line who have to deliver. We've got some smart, experienced players. If they see something, I trust them to have the autonomy to exploit it.\"",
      "The 41-year-old also confirmed that starting Fernandes upon his return from injury was always the plan. \"It's important Bruno's back but that was always part of the plan,\" he explained.",
      "\"This game was targeted for a couple of players coming back from injury so we've got a stronger bench tonight. Looking forward to seeing the lads play, we've set them up in a way we think is best for us to win the match that suits their personalities and suits their styles and it's up to them to execute it.\"",
      "United announced Amorim's sacking on Monday. Amorim left with the worst win ratio (32 per cent) in the Premier League of any United manager, but United are still well-positioned to secure European football.",
      "The Reds are sixth in the top flight, just three points adrift of Liverpool in fourth position.",

      "Gary Neville has been critical of Manchester United but Darren Fletcher won't tell him to go easy(Image: )",
      "Darren Fletcher won't tell his former teammates now working in the media to go easy on his Manchester United team, despite the criticism being levelled at players and the club being raised under Ruben Amorim. In his press conference broadside at club officials on Sunday, Amorim suggested that even executives were influenced by criticism from the likes of Gary Neville.",
      "The club's former right-back is one of a cohort of United greats who have waded in on the club in their media roles, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes also heavily critical. Those attacks have damaged the confidence of some players and caused divisions between the dressing room and some United greats, but Fletcher believes those now wearing the shirt should embrace the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can’t ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher said of the critical pundits he played with. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Although the withering attacks on a string of disappointing performances and underwhelming seasons have been seen internally as damaging, Fletcher turned the equation on its head and said players should be grateful for the support they receive inside Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters have rarely turned on the team despite their struggles, with Fletcher pointing out that wouldn't be the case everywhere given the struggles United have endured in recent years, with finishes of sixth, eighth and 15th in three of the previous four seasons.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's decision to appoint Ruben Amorim in November 2024 was a surprise after he hadn't really featured in discussions that summer(Image: )",
      "The irony of Manchester United's new power structure appointing Ruben Amorim as the club's first head coach in November 2024 is that a few months earlier, his name hadn't really been in the frame at all. That was the summer when Liverpool considered appointing Amorim, only to opt for Arne Slot amid concerns over the Portuguese's system, his stubbornness in playing it and how the squad would fit. Those concerns were cast aside at Old Trafford later in the year.",
      "But for a few heady, confusing weeks in the summer of 2024, change was in the air at United, too. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had decided to sack Erik ten Hag and contenders to replace him were lined up on the catwalk. Then Ten Hag won the FA Cup final, United dithered and the Dutchman stayed, new contract, pay rise and all.",
      "Before that, Ratcliffe spoke to potential replacements as United scoured the market. They met with Thomas Tuchel in Monaco and the German was right at the top of the list of likely appointments, should they have gone through with the decision to dispense with Ten Hag.",
      "There were also talks with Premier League managers, as Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Roberto De Zerbi were all considered. However, there was little indication that Amorim was part of the conversation before the Ibiza summit, which led to Ten Hag staying.",
      "That decision was reversed within four months, with no improvement in results under the Dutchman. As United looked for a replacement this time, Amorim was high on the shortlist. For all the reservations of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and his colleagues at Anfield, the Sporting head coach's stock was high.",
      "Perhaps the switch to Amorim and a coach with such a unique style of play can be attributed to chief executive Omar Berrada settling into the job. Berrada was particularly taken by Amorim's personality and charisma. Speaking to the BBC in March of this year, Ratcliffe explained the decision to stick with Ten Hag as one made at \"short notice\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, we are a consensus organisation,\" he said. \"So there's a collection of us who make decisions. It's not just me that makes the decision, it involves that management team.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik the management team hadn't been in place more than five minutes. Omar [Berrada] had only just arrived, Jason [Wilcox] had not been there terribly long, so we didn't really have the management team in place for very long to make… it was a very difficult decision to make at short notice.\"",
      "That consensus was lacking when Amorim was appointed. Berrada and Ratcliffe might have been on board with the decision, but Wilcox needed convincing and Ashworth's doubts never dissipated. Having insisted that a football structure would make a decision on a style of play, Ratcliffe turned to a head coach who was unique in this department.",
      "What does that tell us about the next search for a head coach, now that Amorim has gone? The structure is more settled, with Ashworth having also left. Berrada and Wilcox are the key figures, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell on the rise. Ratcliffe will again be involved.",
      "The management team that Ratcliffe discussed should be able to make the right decision this time, but they will be under pressure to do so. Given the names under consideration in June 2024, the decision to appoint Amorim felt like a change in strategy. Maybe it warns us to expect the unexpected as United consider their options this time around.",

      "The decision followed the Portuguese manager's explosive outburst during his post-match media briefing. Darren Fletcher has been installed as caretaker boss for the fixture at Turf Moor, whilst the club weighs up their options for appointing an interim head coach through to the season's conclusion.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick emerge as the frontrunners. Nevertheless, the visiting supporters at Burnley have voiced their opinions on the circumstances.",
      "A banner declaring: \"JIM CAN'T FIX THIS\" was visible from the away section before kick-off. Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have also faced criticism this week.",
      "Manchester United fans hold up a sign protesting against Sir Jim Ratcliffe ahead of their match at Burnley.(Image: )",
      "It's believed that Wilcox arranged a discussion with Amorim last week regarding tactical matters, though it ended with both parties failing to reach a consensus.",
      "Prior to the match, it was revealed that Solskjaer and Carrick had both held additional discussions with the United hierarchy.",
      "Solskjaer is reportedly the preferred choice to assume control for the remainder of this campaign, having previously excelled in the Old Trafford hot seat.",

      "Solskjaer is set to return to Norway tomorrow from his Cheshire residence to attend a close friend's funeral.",
      "However, it's understood that he could be appointed before the start of next week. A permanent successor is anticipated to take over at the end of the season.",
      "Thomas Tuchel, who was previously targeted before the appointment of Amorim in November 2024, remains a top contender.",

      "Darren Fletcher has been tasked with returning Manchester United to winning ways at Burnley this evening(Image: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "It will be a proud night for the Fletcher family when Darren enters the dugout, potentially with sons Jack and Tyler following, for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Burnley at Turf Moor. The 41-year-old was appointed interim manager of the Reds on Monday following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "In his first press conference, Fletcher refused to say whether his twin sons, who joined from Manchester City in 2023, would be part of the matchday squad. But if they are, it will undoubtedly be the first time a manager and his twins have been part of the backroom staff and squad in the Premier League.",
      "While that is not a guarantee to happen tonight, there are some scenarios which we expect to pan out at Turf Moor during Fletcher's first game in charge of the Reds. So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what we think will happen.",
      "Considering the fallout from Amorim's sacking, it seems highly unlikely Fletcher will choose to stick with a back three formation. The Portuguese head coach looked to appease the owners on Boxing Day by playing a back four against Newcastle and it worked.",
      "By no means was the performance perfect, particularly in the second half, but it was the last time United tasted victory and it seems certain the back four will return at Turf Moor. It also makes more sense to play a four at the back now, considering the players at Fletcher's disposal.",
      "Amad is United's best wing-back but he is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Diogo Dalot has played on the left and right, but he is much better as a full-back and thus a return to this system would be beneficial for the Reds.",
      "There must have been an audible sigh of relief among United households across the world when Fletcher announced Bruno Fernandes would be back in the matchday squad tonight. Not only is Fernandes the captain, but he is also the star player in a team which struggles for consistency.",
      "You have to wonder in the games against Wolves and Leeds whether United would have won had Fernandes been on the park. The Portuguese midfielder has a knack of creating moments of magic out of seemingly impossible situations and his creativity has been missed desperately.",
      "Of course, Fernandes may not play the full 90 minutes, considering his recent return from injury. But, we can expect Fletcher to lean in heavily on the captain and potentially even start him - if only for the first 45 minutes - to rouse the troops.",
      "Whether the fans make their feelings towards the boardroom clear tonight will be interesting to see. A lot of supporters have been left angered by the manner in which Sir Jim Ratcliffe has run football operations since acquiring a minority stake in the club.",
      "This does not necessarily mean they are unhappy Amorim has gone, but there will likely be a large amount of fans travelling to Burnley who feel Ratcliffe has embarrassed the club with another quick upheaval. Should the travelling supporters voice those opinions, remains to be seen.",
      "What is not in doubt is the rousing reception Fletcher will receive as he strides out at Turf Moor this evening. United fans adore most of their ex-players, as will be proven if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer takes on the caretaker role until the end of the season.",
      "And one certainty Fletcher can rely on is the away fans backing both him and the team tonight.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "One of those suitors may well be Manchester United who are searching for a new manager after sacking Ruben Amorim on Monday.",
      "The reported plan would be to employ an interim coach until the end of the season before appointing a full-time manager in the summer but Xavi’s current availability may change that.",
      "However, according to Fabrizio Romano, there have been no discussions between the two parties yet with the United hierarchy only having just begun the formal search for a manager.",
      "“At the moment, I am not aware of negotiations between Xavi and Manchester United,” Romano said. “United have now started the process of selecting their coach and we will have to see what can happen in the future. As of today there is nothing advanced or anything concrete.”",
      "However, Xavi is said to be open to a Premier League role and is ready to return to management having been out of the game for 19 months.",
      "“What I can say is that Xavi would love to coach in the Premier League,” Romano continued. “He feels ready to return to coaching and write a new chapter after his departure from Barcelona and taking some time to disconnect.",

      "Amorim parted ways with Man Utd on Monday morning, wth his exit a disastrous 14 months in which the Premier League side slumped to embarrassing new lows.",
      "His position at Old Trafford became untenable after he publicly hit out at the club over a transfer disagreement, with the head coach also heavily criticised over his refusal to adapt his formation.",

      "Amorim was doomed to fail for a while, but The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has broken down the events leading up to last week’s infamous meeting between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "“When he [Amorim] reverted to his back 3 against Wolves, who are struggling in form, that was an alarming and concerning development. There were conversations had between all the powerbrokers at United,” Whitwell said on the Talk of the Devils podcast.",
      "“It came ahead at the Friday meeting where Wilcox put points to him, one being that players weren’t on the same wavelength as Amorim and Amorim did not react well to that.”",
      "Whitwell has also shed light on when Ratcliffe’s relationship with Amorim began to change.",
      "“Omar Berrarda was a big advocate for Ruben Amorim coming in, Sir Jim Ratcliffe as well. Ratcliffe had a long, good conversation with Amorim early in the process and was backing him throughout, even when Amorim was questioning his own status,” he continued.",
      "“Ratcliffe started having opinions shall we say about United playing a back four and this is when Jason Wilcox became more forceful in his conversations on that basis.",

      "‘Sources have informed CaughtOffside that Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham from the Premier League, Bayern Munich in Germany, PSG in France and Barcelona in Spain are all “closely monitoring” the player. The market mood points to “summer, not January,” with Leipzig expected to keep the door shut until bids near the €100m mark arrive later in the year.",
      "‘United have already moved forward, with reports suggesting talks over a five‑plus‑one‑year deal worth around €3.5m per season. Leipzig have allowed discussions despite their stance against a January sale. Still, the picture is clear: unless a huge bid lands now, Diomande’s future battle will be fought in the summer among Europe’s biggest clubs.’",

      "Who knows who will actually be in the dugout for Manchester United by the time Sunday afternoon rolls around, but it’s probably going to be a former United man who played under Sir Alex Ferguson, because remaining in deep and perpetual thrall to the Cult of Ferg has gone so well up to now.",
      "Will it be Darren Fletcher? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? Michael Carrick? Solskjaer and Carrick? All bloody three of them and maybe Steve Bruce as well because why not? Who knows. Certainly not us, that’s for sure.",
      "What we do know is that this is a choppy little fixture for Man United and whichever of Fergie’s disciples happen(s) to be in charge on the day. Having gone out of the Carabao at the earliest possible opportunity via that infamous disaster at Grimsby and having failed to qualify for Europe after the even more embarrassing act of losing an actual final to actual Spurs, United now face the very real prospect of the smallest possible season.",
      "That comes with some perks, of course, but is just not really the done thing when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. If they come unstuck against draw specialists Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend – and United’s win over the Seagulls this season snapped a three-game losing home streak against them – it’ll be a potless 40-game season for a once proud club.",
      "What is left of the season will be spent on a probably unsuccessful bid to achieve Champions League football under some combination of caretakers and interims. It’s no life, that, is it?",
      "As for Brighton, they join your Evertons and your Villas and your Forests among the more conspicuous remaining trophy-dodgers after last season’s astonishing run of success for others of that ilk like Palace and Newcastle and Spurs.",
      "Feels like we say this every single season and it never ever happens, but the FA Cup surely presents a wonderful opportunity for Brighton to do something genuinely staggering. Especially when they’re so safely ensconced as the most mid-table side in the Premier League’s most mid-table season ever.",
      "If nothing else, the sight of Palace winning it must have stirred something.",
      "",
      "From one chaotic Big Six club to another as Chelsea begin their new project under Liam Rosenior having used all their expert boardroom negotiating skills to lure him away from Strasbourg. What a coup that is, by the way.",
      "Rosenior was in the directors’ box to watch Calum McFarlane’s side slip to a pretty ropey 2-1 defeat at Fulham in midweek, but now starts life on his shiny new six-year (stop laughing, please) contract with a short trip to Charlton.",
      "It’s been 19 years since Chelsea last played Charlton, and the winning goal that day came from a certain Frank Lampard which just keeps the whole manager narrative ticking along nicely.",
      "Fair to say this looks like the easier of the two early cup dates on Rosenior’s immediate to-do list, with Arsenal up next in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg. It’s a relatively gentle start that clearly comes with only one acceptable outcome.",
      "That makes it all the more exciting, though, and there’s no doubt a certain wild unpredictability crept into Chelsea’s football during the final weeks of Enzo Maresca’s increasingly curious tenure and even across McFarlane’s two games.",
      "Even harder to predict what on earth Chelsea might serve up here under a new manager with so little experience of his new level, but the fact it feels roughly equally plausible for Chelsea to go full banana skin as it does for them to win 8-0 or something suggests it should be worth tuning in.",
      "",
      "We’re assuming he starts for Arsenal at Portsmouth with Viktor Gyokeres back in the XI for the Chelsea Carabao semi-final clash in midweek, but honestly who knows now? If we’re wrong, just imagine we put Gyokeres here instead.",
      "It will be a big chance for whoever gets the start anyway, with Gyokeres’ already much-discussed disappearing act in several games reaching new lows in an eight-touch effort in the pouring rain of the very dampest 0-0 squib against Liverpool.",
      "Jesus came on late in the second half and certainly helped liven things up, having Arsenal’s first attempt on goal of the second half just as the clock ticked past 90 minutes and into injury time.",
      "One imagines that chances will be slightly more forthcoming for whoever is in at Portsmouth as Arsenal embark upon the fourth prong of what is quite probably only now days away from being considered a genuine quadruple tilt even though quadruple tilts by English teams absolutely never, ever amount to anything.",
      "To be honest, Arsenal’s best bet might be to get knocked out of this and just win the other three rather than risk spreading themselves too thinly. But are they willing to listen to such good advice and simply win the Premier League, Champions League and Carabao or like Icarus will they fly too close to the sun and chase the impossible?",
      "",
      "It’s all about optics, isn’t it? The photos of Thomas Frank wandering gormlessly around Bournemouth looking gormless with a little Arsenal-branded coffee cup in his hand already have a Steve McClaren wally-with-the-brolly quality to them. When – and it is surely now when not if – the axe finally falls on this doomed experiment, those are the pictures that will accompany this story’s telling.",
      "There is a profound Spurs quality to the absurdity of it all, of course. The series of events that leads to it even being possible just feels like something that only happens and could only happen to Spurs.",
      "But also… consider the reverse. Imagine Mikel Arteta was ‘caught’ supping from a Spurs cup. It would all feel very different, wouldn’t it? The memes would all be about ‘drinking Spurs tears’ and such. Even a few short months ago, this daft little incident happening exactly as it now has would have produced many banters about the impressiveness of finding a cup with Arsenal’s name on it. How we’d have laughed.",
      "Point is, it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s all a projection. But a powerful one nevertheless, one that comes to symbolise everything for a manager who arrived as a details man and now can’t even spot a big ol’ Arsenal badge on a little coffee cup.",
      "What actually does matter, we fear, is that Frank has started talking complete b*llocks. Again, pretty understandable that anyone tasked with managing Spurs eventually finds themselves doing so, but it’s not a sign of anything good.",
      "Consider this astonishing guff.",
      "“In a storm, some are building fences and hiding behind it, others are building windmills and getting stronger and getting more energy and learning from it.”",
      "Now that’s the sort of thing you might normally expect to find written on a toilet wall, but written in sh*t. Or worse, on LinkedIn. Or worse still, on a Jake Humphrey podcast.",
      "But here’s the thing that’s even worse than talking like a Jake Humphrey podcast guest – if you can even imagine such a concept. It doesn’t even actually work on its own batsh*t terms.",
      "First of all, if you’re building anything in a storm then you’ve already f*cked it by failing to adequately prepare yourself. Build the windmill before the storm arrives, if anything.",
      "But also… Frank is no windmill-builder. He has spent recent weeks complaining about the fans, repeatedly pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if that is normal or acceptable rather than the specific thing he has been tasked with changing rather than aiming to repeat, and noting that January is a very difficult month.",
      "The storm has arrived and he’s been busy building crappy little fences and drinking Arsenal coffee.",
      "Anyway, on Saturday his dreary Spurs team take on an Aston Villa team that’s already beaten them once at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this season and will fully expect to do so again. And with that will go the last lingering hope of Spurs enjoying any escape from the drudgery of trying to make sure a bad season doesn’t become a truly catastrophic one.",
      "Barring, of course, a Champions League knockout run of such vanishing unlikelihood as to make the 2019 effort look prosaic.",
      "There is no avoiding the thought that Thomas Frank’s fictitious windmill is about to get all spattered with some more very real sh*t.",
      "",
      "An inevitably reduced League One and Two schedule with cup runs still ongoing all over the shop, but that doesn’t deny us a pretty big game in the keenly-contested League One promotion race as Stockport and Huddersfield – separated by no points but two places in the play-off spots – clash at Edgeley Park.",
      "Stockport have been hit and miss since going out of the FA Cup on penalties to League Two Cambridge, with as many wins as defeats in seven subsequent games while Huddersfield have put a four-match losing run in autumn – including a 2-1 defeat to Stockport at the John Smith’s – behind them but remain too prone to draws despite losing just two of their last 12 league games.",
      "",
      "What better way to round out a weekend full of all manner of cup magic than by tuning into the final of the Spanish Super Cup, which will be played between Barcelona and Real Madrid now the formalities of getting rid of semi-finalists Atletico Madrid and Athletic Club have been taken care of.",
      "Admittedly, you might argue that what would be better would be doing all of the above but watching it happen in Spain rather than Saudi Arabia but there’s not much we can do about that at this time.",
      "",
      "Third plays fourth as these two try desperately to keep up with the ferocious pace currently being set by Man City at the top of the table and all too aware that neither of them have yet shaken off Tottenham in what is for now looking like a four-way battle also involving fallen perennial champions Chelsea for two Champions League spots.",

      "“Those five games should have given us more than the five points we got. Probably eight, nine, 10 points. That’s what we are focusing on.",
      "“It is my job to deal with scrutiny. I will take all the questions and the blame. It is also my job to look through everything and look through the defeat last night. It was emotional but in many ways it was good and we deserve more.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, whose latest crime is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of the boardroom suits. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, and one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "Arsenal next, and a non-zero chance that any repeat of the Etihad capitulation in the face of the only compellingly good team in the league could spell the end.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers.

      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated.

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 20 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and basically had nothing to do v Palace.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save v Fulham.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in. Though he’s hardly convincing…",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save v Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Will be lucky to keep his place after the FA Cup game week.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Martinelli come in for different criticism after ‘pathetic’ and ‘soft’ Arsenal ‘totally froze’ when Liverpool put on a ‘clinic’.",

      "Thursday 8 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "With results and style so poor, it's inevitable the pressure is ramping up around Frank. He must find a way to change things and fast before it is taken out of his hands.Ron Walker",
      "It's been a tough start to 2026 for Man City.",
      "They are without a win so far this year and they've been hit with injuries to key players. Central defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias and winger Savinho have sufferred significant injuries. John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",
      "And while Brighton did spurn some really good early chances, it wasn't City's makeshift defence that cost them victory at the Etihad.",
      "Pep Guardiola bemoaned the chances his side wasted, not only against Brighton, but also in the draws against Sunderland and Chelsea.",
      "Guardiola said: \"The result is the result. I'm not a person who believes what we have done isn't fair. One point for them, one point for us. That is what it is. I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",
      "It was a heart-breaking outcome for Leeds, who took a deserved lead through Brenden Aaronson's superb first-half strike and kept putting their noses back in front. Their brave performance, at a ground were so many teams struggle, deserves acclaim.",
      "For the neutral, the end-to-end action of the game was a tonic to some of the stop-start, set-piece-heavy offerings served up in the Premier League this season.",
      "The number of goals could easily have been higher. The woodwork was struck three times. There were goalmouth scrambles, goalkeeper saves, last-ditch defensive interventions galore. It was an occasion to savour, albeit not for Leeds fans.Nick Wright",
      "Liam Rosenior will have seen first-hand a major issue for this Chelsea team: a lack of discipline.",
      "Marc Cucurella's red card was as blatant as they come (whether the foul continued into the penalty area and should have been a spot-kick is another debate).",
      "It was Chelsea's seventh red card across all competitions - that's four more than any other Premier League team. They're just one off their Premier League record of six with almost half a season to go.",
      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",
      "It's Harry Wilson's world and we're just living in it. \"Right now everything that he touches becomes something magic,\" said his boss Marco Silva, after the Welshman hit Fulham's winner against 10-man Chelsea.",
      "That's nine goal involvements in his past 10 games for Wilson. \"The numbers are top, incredible,\" added the Fulham head coach.",
      "Silva reckons this is Wilson's \"best moment\" of his career and it's hard to argue. Of course there have been other standout moments for him in a Fulham shirt but Silva noted how the pair had a conversation last season to help try to draw out these kind of consistently impactful performances.",
      "\"In terms of maturity, decision-making, more calm in some moments - you don't need 100 per cent speed in everything,\" Silva explained.",
      "Wilson, Silva and Fulham are reaping the rewards now.Peter Smith",
      "\"Because of my career and the teams I've managed, I've been through a lot of these awkward games.\" And Sean Dyche tends to succeed in most of them.",
      "Four consecutive defeats in a row set Nottingham Forest up to be dragged further into the relegation scrap by West Ham. After just 13 minutes, that was their reality.",
      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",
      "Forest had more xG, more shots on target, more touches in the opposition box and more possession. And with Dyche they had more experience in how to grind out a crucial victory in a relegation six-pointer.",
      "\"It's not easy on anybody,\" he concluded. \"The players, overall, have just about deserved it.\"David Richardson",
      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Darren Fletcher's first game in charge against Burnley has meant a temporary halt to the active talks with candidates as everyone at the club focuses on that match, but I'd expect things to accelerate towards the back end of this week.",
      "Jason Wilcox, the club's director of football, was key in the decision to sack Ruben Amorim, and is leading the search for his successor - both in the short and the long term.",
      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",

      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 22:11, UK",
      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 10:57, UK",
      "Darren Fletcher will be in charge of Man Utd for the first time after taking interim charge following Ruben Amorim's sacking on Monday.",
      "United are sixth in the table on 31 points, three points off fourth-placed Liverpool. They have drawn their last two games against Leeds and Wolves.",
      "The previous meeting between the two sides this season saw Man Utd beat Burnley 3-2 at Old Trafford thanks to Bruno Fernandes' late penalty.",
      "Burnley vs Manchester United in the Premier League takes place on Wednesday January 7 at Turf Moor. Kick-off is 8.15pm UK and Ireland time.",
      "Stream: Non Sky Customers can stream the game with a NOW Day or a cancel-anytime Month pass",

      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."

      "Man Utd must appoint a manager who fits with their footballing DNA, according to Gary Neville, but would fit the bill? Between the Lines breaks down the side's stylistic profile under Sir Alex Ferguson and ranks the managers whose approaches are most similar",
      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 11:16, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Michael Carrick also make our top 10.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is 11th and Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 12th - just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Recently-axed Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who has also been linked, sits 20th in our list, with a suitability score of 67.52 out of 100.",
      "Pep Guardiola was a reported target for Manchester United before his appointment at Manchester City back in 2016 but interestingly, he sits bottom of our 32-man list, with a stylistic suitability score of just 50.77 out of 100.",
      "Some of the mooted candidates to take over from Amorim sit low in the list too, including Gareth Southgate, Kieran McKenna, Roberto De Zerbi and the Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, suggesting they are not great fits for the club's DNA.",
      "Explore our interactive graphic to see how our selected managers' styles compare to Manchester United's DNA under Ferguson.",
