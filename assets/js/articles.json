The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "If this season was meant to be the launchpad for Manchester United's great comeback, then the wait continues.",
      "Despite spending in excess of £200million over the summer, bringing in an entirely new attack to give his side the kind of goalscoring threat so sorely lacking during last season's worst-ever Premier League campaign, the Red Devils are continuing to spend more time pondering over defeat than building on victories.",
      "Pressure continues to mount on Ruben Amorim. Saturday's latest reverse, the 3-1 failure at Brentford, another showcase of his stubbornness and refusal to change from Plan A - no matter how ill-equipped his team looks in doing what he asks, and no matter how much opponents now know exactly what they're facing.",
      "The suggestion from Old Trafford is that, ahead of this weekend's meeting with newly-promoted Sunderland and the upcoming international break, the Portuguese continues to retain the backing of the board and that no replacement is being lined up.",
      "But with Amorim having now won just 34 points from 33 top flight matches since taking over from Erik ten Hag, perhaps time should be up on his Old Trafford tenure.",
      "Chief Football Writer",
      "Enough is enough - time to go.",
      "Amorim looks horribly out of his depth and it is time Manchester United put him out of his misery.",
      "I absolutely hate to see managers lose their jobs and I've been someone who has said all along that United have to give Amorim time otherwise they will get stuck in a vicious circle or sack, hire, repeat. But the latest defeat at Brentford just summed it all up: they looked like a rudderless ship, paralysed by a stupid formation and system which just does not suit these players.",
      "The most remarkable thing in all of this is the way that the fans have given him so much support and backing. They have been incredible. And you cannot question the board's backing either: their summer spending spree was massive and all designed to help Amorim's failing tactics work. I admire their loyalty now.",
      "But his record is shocking. Nine wins from 33 Premier League games in charge. Their start to the season has been woeful. They struggled to beat Burnley and just got over the line against 10-man Chelsea.",
      "They are just delaying the inevitable. Amorim seems like a nice guy. But he looks lost. It is simply not working and now United are in danger of writing off another season.",
      "The only thing keeping him in a job right now is probably that there is no obvious replacement. You should have one. Maybe they should leave it until the international break - but it's time to act.",
      "Chief Sports Writer",
      "Ruben Amorim has to go. And if Manchester United bosses are not putting in plans now to find his replacement, then more fool them.",
      "It doesn't take a genius to work out Amorim and United just isn't working. And never will.",
      "He appears to have lost the dressing room, doesn't have the quality of players to fit into his rigid system and is too stubborn to change his methods and tactics. In the 10 months he's been in charge, United haven't got better. He hasn't improved a single player.",
      "And considering he hasn't won back-to-back league games in all that time, then this is the most damning statistic of all.",
      "Amorim is a nice bloke. But United need a winner - not someone who is easy to like.",
      "Chief Manchester United Writer",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and a pathetic haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way as his predecessor.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casemiro's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for him to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment.",
      "But there is no shame in admitting that decision was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it.",
      "Manchester United Writer",
      "I'm reluctant to say Amorim should be sacked, given we're just six games into the Premier League season, but it's beginning to feel like dithering on his future is only delaying the inevitable.",
      "The Grimsby Town debacle was a shocking new low. The Manchester derby defeat was embarrassing. The mood improved after Chelsea, but Amorim failed to win back-to-back league games for the first time against Brentford, which forced the club to clarify their position on his future again.",
      "A roaring success story is now required for Amorim to turn United around - but he cannot win two games on the bounce. All the signs are currently pointing toward Amorim losing his job in the coming weeks.",
      "I understand their logic in giving Amorim more time. United heavily backed him in the summer window and have come this far, so what damage could a few more games in charge cause?",
      "Sacking Amorim would also reflect badly on Berrada and Wilcox, who should be scrutinised if Amorim is axed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim retains the backing of Manchester United's hierarchy after Saturday's defeat to Brentford, but candidates continue to be linked with the vacancy. The Portuguese suffered his 17th Premier League defeat in 33 games over the weekend to add more pressure.",
      "Amorim was hoping to build on the 2-1 win over Chelsea and secure back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time. But United suffered another miserable defeat with Brentford cruising to victory. In the aftermath of the defeat, speculation has intensified over Amorim's future at the club.",

      "Zinedine Zidane is a name once again being bandied as a potential successor to Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The Portuguese has had a rocky start to his first full Premier League season, managing just one win, two draws and three losses.",
      "Adding salt to the wound, his side was knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town in the second round and failed to secure a spot in any European competitions this season, underscoring the need for better league results. The noise around Amorim's future is growing louder.",
      "And if he were to be shown the door, Zidane could well emerge as an early favourite to take over. The 53-year-old Frenchman, who won the World Cup as a player, is currently without a club, having left Real Madrid for the second time in 2021.",
      "His impressive track record in the Spanish capital makes him a tantalising prospect for the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "During his first stint at the helm of Los Blancos between 2016 and 2018, Zidane boasted a winning record of 70 per cent. He bagged nine trophies during this period, including an unprecedented hat-trick of Champions League titles in 2016, 2017, and 2018.",
      "Under Zidane's leadership, Real triumphed over Atletico Madrid, Juventus, and Liverpool in the finals, making him the only coach in history to win Europe's premier club competition three times on the trot.",
      "During his second tenure with Los Blancos, Zidane boasted a 60 per cent win rate, bagging two more trophies to bring his total haul with the club to 11.",
      "Moreover, United fans can take delight in Zidane's personal record against some of Europe's toughest teams. During his time with Real, he never tasted defeat in six visits to Camp Nou - the home of arch-rivals Barcelona.",
      "He remained unbeaten in three trips to cross-city rivals Atletico Madrid's new home, the Wanda Metropolitano.",
      "However, it's worth noting that the Frenchman was on the losing side during the club's final visit to Atleti's former home, the Vicente Calderon.",
      "That was a Champions League semi-final second leg clash, but Real still progressed to the final. In visits to Germany with Real, Zidane went unbeaten in two trips each to Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena and Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion.",
      "Furthermore, Zidane's mastery of the toughest challenges included remaining undefeated on visits to Anfield to face Liverpool, Juventus' Allianz Stadium, and the San Siro, where Inter Milan were his opponents.",
      "The 53-year-old boasts an impressive honours list as a manager, winning two La Liga titles, three Champions League titles, two Club World Cups and two Supercopa de España.",

      "Marcus Rashford sent Manchester United a fresh reminder of his quality as he helped Barcelona to a fifth consecutive win. Rashford, 27, continued his strong start to life in Catalunya with an assist during Barca's 2-1 win at home to Real Sociedad on Sunday.",
      "The La Liga champions looked to be heading into half-time with a 1-0 deficit following Alvaro Odriozola's opening goal. But just one minute before the board went up for added time, Rashford whipped in an inch-perfect corner to find the head of Jules Kounde, who powered home the equaliser.",
      "Robert Lewandowski then scored the winner in the second half, courtesy of an incredible assist from super sub Lamine Yamal, to send Barcelona top of the table. Barca's form could hardly be more different from that of United, who suffered their fourth loss in seven games on Saturday, going down 3-1 at Brentford.",
      "Rashford's parent club are in turmoil while the England international is thriving with his new team-mates.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim is under increasing pressure, having cast Rashford aside nearly a year ago; ruthlessly deciding that the Red Devils' academy graduate wasn't part of his plans at Old Trafford.",
      "Having joined Barcelona on a season-long loan in July, Rashford has contributed to five goals in eight games. The 27-year-old scored two goals in their Champions League opener against Newcastle and now has three assists in domestic action.",
      "That's a stark contrast to United's new forward line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who have just three goal involvements between them so far. It's no wonder that talk of Rashford staying with Barca permanently is already ramping up.",
      "After the win on Sunday, Rashford posted on Instagram: \"Huge 3 points! Let's keep pushing.\"",

      "Igor Thiago capitalised on Harry Maguire's shaky defending to net the opener, before Altay Bayindir handed the striker a second. Benjamin Sesko pulled one back for United with his maiden goal for the club, but Bruno Fernandes failed to convert from the penalty spot for the second time this season.",

      "United shelled out approximately £9.2m to buy him out of his contract, and should they choose to part ways with Amorim within the first year of his contract, they will face a significant compensation bill.",

      "The pressure is once again mounting on Ruben Amorim's shoulders after Manchester United's dismal 3-1 defeat to Brentford on Saturday. Just days after restoring some optimism with a much-needed win over Chelsea, the Red Devils surrendered all their momentum in a bruising day at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "One positive to take from the game was the fact Benjamin Sesko finally opened his account with his first United goal. But the milestone was overshadowed by the team's latest poor performance and collapse.",
      "United spent the afternoon chasing the game, conceding twice within the opening 20 minutes. Sesko offered a lifeline by pulling one back midway through the first half, but any hopes of a comeback were extinguished in stoppage time as Brentford sealed the victory with a third goal.",
      "The defeat wasn't without controversy. Bruno Fernandes squandered a chance to draw level when he missed a penalty after United fans had been incensed that Nathan Collins escaped with only a yellow card after dragging down Bryan Mbeumo in what many viewed as a clear last-man foul.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly made direct contact with Gareth Southgate as doubts over Amorim's future continue to mount. The INEOS chief is said to have placed the former England manager on a three-man shortlist of potential successors.",
      "According to talkSPORT, the other names under consideration are Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. However, Southgate may hold the advantage given Ratcliffe's long-standing admiration for him, as well as being the only free agent.",
      "Southgate's name first emerged as a candidate for the United job when Ratcliffe became co-owner in February 2024, and resurfaced again following Erik ten Hag's dismissal later that year.",
      "The 55-year-old has been out of work since stepping down as England manager after Euro 2024, but his prospects at Old Trafford may hinge on timing. Reports suggest United are reluctant to part ways with Amorim before November 1, when the compensation owed to the Portuguese coach would be significantly reduced.",
      "Many felt United were hard done by on Saturday after Brentford narrowly avoided a red card, including former Premier League referee Mark Halsey. Collins conceded a second half penalty after bringing down former Bees forward Mbeumo in the box as the last man.",
      "He was awarded a yellow card, but some think he should have been sent off since he was denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. VAR disagreed, confirming referee Craig Pawson's on-field decision following a review.",
      "A statement from the Premier League Match Centre was later released explaining the decision. \"The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR - with Collins deemed to have pulled Mbeumo back,\" it read. \"VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",
      "However, Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for more than 10 years, slammed both the decision and the subsequent explanation, suggesting the correct call was cut and dry.",
      "\"The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball,\" he told the Sun. \"It doesn't say in law about having the ball under control. It's about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball.",
      "\"In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity. Manchester United will be very disappointed with that decision. A red card should have been shown to the Brentford player.\"",

      "The former Real Madrid midfielder has been without a job since 2021 and has been associated with almost every top club vacancy since his departure from Los Blancos. However, convincing the Ballon d'Or winner to move to England could prove a significant challenge for United.",

I've put my career on hold for a while, but I fully feel like a coach.\" Whilst this means that Zidane remains available until the conclusion of the campaign, it's challenging to envisage both United and the former midfielder accepting a temporary arrangement for fewer than 12 months.",

The Red Devils found themselves in a difficult position after Igor Thiago netted twice in the first half, although Benjamin Sesko's goal before half-time gave them some hope.",

Ruben Amorim's team couldn't secure consecutive victories, leaving themselves with a steep challenge in the capital as Bruno Fernandes squandered a second-half spot-kick.",
      "It was how the Bees gave away the penalty that has caused controversy. Matheus Cunha delivered the ball to Bryan Mbeumo, who had a clear view of goal, before being dragged down in the box by Collins.",
      "The spot-kick was awarded and the Republic of Ireland defender received a yellow card for hauling down the Cameroon striker, but after clarification from the Premier League Match Centre X account, a community note has appeared on the post.",

      "Premium subscribers of the platform can add community notes when they can demonstrate that the original statement is false. Citing the International Football Association Board (IFAB) laws of the game, a counter-argument was presented which stated: \"Control of the ball is not required for a red card.",

      "The IFAB laws specify: \"Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.\"",
      "Within the match context, Collins stayed on the pitch when the dismissal would have boosted United.",

      "Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot, but decided against showing Collins a red card. That was despite the United striker being poised to fire a shot at goal from close distance.",
      "The VAR on duty backed up Pawson’s decision, with Bruno Fernandes missing from the spot to add further insult to injury. A statement from the Premier League Match Centre explained the decision with a statement released swiftly after the penalty was awarded.",

      "\"VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",
      "However, Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for more than 10 years, slammed the decision - and subsequent explanation, suggesting the correct call was cut and dry.",
      "Halsey told the Sun: “The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball.It doesn’t say in law about having the ball under control.",
      "“It’s about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball. “In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "“Manchester United will be very disappointed with that decision. A red card should have been shown to the Brentford player.”",
      "Defeat at the GTech was United’s third in just six league matches, leaving them marooned in the bottom half. It also continued Ruben Amorim’s long run of being unable to win back to back Premier League matches.",
      "Amorim refused to openly criticise the decision, instead lamenting his side’s inability to control the game. “We have the ability and the capacity to control the game, to calm down the game. We didn't do that today,” he explained.",
      "“You guys have the ability to make your decision with your opinion of the decision. The referee told me that Bryan [Mbeumo] was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled. So that was the decision.",
      "“Again, I want - especially in these kind of moments - not to focus on the referee. What we should have done this afternoon is play better, and we need to play better.\"",
      "Despite another chastening defeat, the Portuguese boss remains confident that he will be able to turn it around He added: \"It’s like ups and downs. When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum is there.",

      "A Wrexham legend once found himself struggling with debt until Gary Speed came to his aid. Former Welsh winger Mickey Thomas graced some of football's biggest stages during his prime, turning out for Manchester United and Chelsea alongside two stints with the North Wales club.",
      "But he plunged into serious financial trouble after squandering an estimated £500,000 through gambling. Thomas, who was raised in Mochdre, North Wales, previously revealed how he battled a severe gambling addiction that began after departing Wrexham for United in 1978.",
      "He confessed he had \"lost a fortune\" due to his compulsion, which persisted long after hanging up his boots in the mid-1990s.",
      "In his autobiography, published in 2008, he reflected on his addiction, saying: \"Most of the time it's boredom. More often than not it's a release of pressure. In extreme gambling cases like mine you always think you are in control – you never are.",
      "\"I've lost a fortune over the years. Maybe it's £250,000. Maybe it's more like £500,000. Thinking back, that's probably nearer the mark and I'm not proud to admit that. It was easy money. Easy to blow £10,000 on a spin of a roulette ball or the flick of a card.",
      "\"It's an addiction which grabbed me at United but it's one that has grabbed me more in my later years when I retired.\"",
      "Fortunately, the Red Dragons legend, who netted a memorable free-kick that helped Wrexham eliminate Arsenal from the FA Cup in 1992, managed to rebuild his life afterwards. Thomas, who represented Wales 51 times throughout his playing days, revealed it was partly down to his former Leeds colleague Speed's kindness that enabled him to begin settling the substantial debts he had accumulated.",
      "Reflecting several years following the ex-Wales boss's passing in 2011, he said: \"He was such a great bloke. After I hit hard times financially later in life, if he saw me he would always ask if I was all right for money. One day, I went to his house when he was with Newcastle United and he asked me if I wanted any boots.",
      "\"It was up to me what I did with them, maybe sell them to make a few quid to ease the debts. I ended up coming out of his garage with around 30 pairs. That's how generous he was. I will never forget his kindness.\"",
      "Thomas subsequently faced another ordeal following his cancer diagnosis in February 2019 when medics discovered a substantial tumour in his oesophagus. The growth was surgically removed in May that year, though he initially found the follow-up chemotherapy treatment challenging.",
      "He revealed he had received the cancer all-clear in November 2021 and has since campaigned to raise money for the department at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where NHS medics carried out life-saving treatment on him. The 71-year-old remains a familiar face at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground where supporters continue to adore him.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Wrexham's Hollywood owners, Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, also honoured Thomas after the club's promotion from League One in April this year. The pair invited him to their box to witness Wrexham secure their third consecutive promotion in style with a resounding 3-0 victory over Charlton Athletic.",
      "Post-match, Deadpool actor Reynolds shared his ambitions for the club: \"Our goal is to make it to the Premier League. It just seemed like an impossible dream, but as storytellers, you look as much as you can at the macro view of history.",
      "\"Without it I would not be here. You can go all the way back from the Gresford Disaster to Mickey Thomas, who is a huge point of aspiration for this club. And the goal was to reach that feeling – and it is a feeling.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",

      "Ben Foster has revealed the moment Sir Alex Ferguson delivered the crushing news that his Manchester United career was over. But he also explained why he still has nothing but admiration for his former boss despite the heartbreak.",
      "The shot-stopper arrived at United from Stoke City in 2005 after catching the eye of the legendary Scottish manager during a loan spell at Wrexham. He found it tough to establish himself in the first team throughout his Old Trafford tenure, with the reliable Edwin van der Sar firmly established as the club's number one.",
      "The former England goalkeeper went on to claim the League Cup on two occasions with United, though his Premier League outings remained limited. It was an unconvincing display during a heated Manchester derby clash in the top flight in September 2009 that marked the start of his downfall at the club.",
      "Foster was selected by Sir Alex to deputise for the injured Van der Sar in an enthralling 4-3 triumph over Man City, with Michael Owen netting a sensational stoppage-time winner at Old Trafford.",
      "However, a crucial error from the keeper resulted in him facing his manager's notorious \"hairdryer\" treatment once the final whistle had blown. Reflecting on the incident during the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, Foster revealed: \"I had an absolute stinker and I knew the writing was on the wall. I heard the manager saying something, because they had a telly in the changing rooms at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He was watching the replays, and I'm next to him thinking, 'Oh god, someone turn this telly off. This is s***.' He's watching it, and he's said to somebody, 'God, he needs to come out.' I knew he was talking about me and lo and behold, I was out the next week.",
      "\"He would tell you exactly where you stood, but I loved that about him. He was like, 'Listen, I can see that your confidence has gone so I'm taking you out of the team. I'm going to put Tomasz Kuszczak in for a bit, and then Edwin's back in a couple of weeks anyway.'\".",
      "Despite his blunder, Foster found himself back between the sticks for United's Premier League encounter with Sunderland at Old Trafford the following month. Another howler from the goalkeeper allowed Kenwyne Jones to find the net during the 2-2 stalemate.",
      "That crucial moment didn't merely cost him his spot in the squad - it effectively sealed his final top-flight outing for United. Yet reflecting on those dark days, Foster admitted he valued Sir Alex's brutal honesty, whilst departing the club actually kickstarted his career properly.",
      "He explained: \"Big Kenwyne Jones was up front for them, and the ball came into the box. I'd gone to punch it, but he headed it first and scored, and he left me on the floor in a heap. I'm like, 'Oh God'.",
      "\"Again, Patrice Evra scored a last minute goal which rescued me a bit, but the manager was fuming. I remember going into the changing rooms at full-time and then that was the hair dryer.",
      "\"He said, 'You're never playing for this club again', but it was in front of all the lads as well. I just remember thinking, 'Oh, this is horrible. I don't need this.' That was it in my head that I was done, and I was.",
      "\"At the time, it was horrible but I left at the end of that season and signed for Birmingham. That, for me, is when my career really started.\"",
      "Following his departure from Old Trafford at the conclusion of the 2009-10 campaign, Foster moved to Birmingham City, where he established himself as the club's number one keeper, securing a third League Cup triumph with the Blues in 2011.",
      "His stellar displays earned him a switch to West Bromwich Albion in 2012, where he continued his excellent form. Foster, who earned eight England caps throughout his career, subsequently enjoyed a four-year stint at Watford before concluding his playing days back at Wrexham, helping them secure National League glory in 2023.",
      "He now presents his own podcast, dubbed Fozcast, where he chats about football with various guests.",

      "Former Manchester United right-back Richard Eckersley will always remember January 24, 2009.",
      "It was the day he fulfilled his childhood dream of making his first-team debut for the club he joined at just nine years old. Coming off the bench at Old Trafford, Eckersley replaced Fabio in a thrilling FA Cup fourth round tie against Tottenham Hotspur, with United leading 2-1.",
      "At a time when the squad was brimming with big names, Eckersley was pushing for a spot in the first team. He drew inspiration from the commitment, dedication and desire of the club's leading stars.",
      "He recalled: \"You hear stories about them when you're growing up and coming through the academy. You heard about Roy Keane, Giggs, Scholes and their professionalism. You hear in the academy that this is what these players are like and how they got to that stage. It was really inspiring and, for the most part, all the things that I learnt there I have taken into my life now.\"",
      "Eckersley, now 36, made just four first-team outings but does possess a League Cup winners' medal from his Old Trafford days. Despite failing to feature for a single minute during the Reds' march to the 2009 final, he was among the substitutes at Wembley after impressing Sir Alex Ferguson in a reserve clash against Manchester City a few days earlier.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson used to watch all the reserve games and obviously contacted all the coaches,\" said Eckersley. \"I was playing really well in the reserves, and I think we played Manchester City in a reserve game a few days before the League Cup final, and I played really well.",
      "\"I think he just put me on the bench almost as a reward. I guess he was seeing it as an opportunity for me to get some time with the first team and potentially win something.",
      "\"Also, the confidence in me after seeing me play and the confidence in me to say, 'I can put you on the bench.' It was a surreal moment, and I do have a League Cup medal; I think it is in the loft at the minute. Actually, I have not looked at it for a while!\"",
      "Despite remaining an unused substitute, it represented the high point of Eckersley's United journey. Later that year, he chose to leave Old Trafford for newly-promoted Burnley.",
      "It was a choice he would come to rue, as he featured just twice for the Clarets and was sent out on various loan moves. He reflected: \"I think the decision to leave United was probably too early for me.",
      "\"I think I probably should have stayed on and developed at Carrington under the coaches that I was already working with, because I was making steady progress.",
      "\"I think the jump from the cusp of one of the world's greatest teams, you could say at that time, to Burnley, who had just got promoted but were going to be a struggling team in the Premier League, was a massive jump and a massive education for me, in terms of what is men's football and what is it like to play with players that haven't had the pedigree that people at United had.",
      "\"It was a huge shift from where I was at United and the standards that we were setting with professionalism, the facilities and all the kinds of things that we had. You were basically looked after to the nth degree. Then going somewhere like Burnley - and no disrespect to Burnley - they were just in a different headspace.",
      "\"It was just a completely different experience and, in hindsight, I think it would have been sensible for me to stay on [at United].\"",
      "Following loan spells at Plymouth Argyle, Bradford City and Bury, Eckersley headed to the MLS in April 2011, signing for Toronto FC. He said: \"I was desperate just to play and desperate to enjoy football, because at the time I wasn't enjoying football. I was playing in League Two, going on loan to Bradford, Bury, places like that.",
      "\"I went on loan to Plymouth and we were in a bit of a relegation battle. I played under a manager called Paul Mariner, who really liked me and really liked how I played. He got the general manager's job at Toronto, and that is how the move came about to North America.",
      "\"He said come over to the MLS, play for six or seven months on loan and enjoy the football. That is exactly what I did. He took me over and I loved it.",
      "\"I loved living by myself, I loved the culture, I loved the relaxation around football and people just enjoying the football. Don't get me wrong, the football was a very physical league, going here, there and everywhere, but I just felt that it was such an enjoyable time for me as a player, to enjoy just focusing on football and also off the pitch as well, learning to live by myself and on my own.",
      "\"I had a close-knit bond with my team-mates and it was a really enjoyable time. From there, I just wanted to stay and that was how it triggered.\"",
      "Eckersley stayed at Toronto for just under three years, featuring 92 times for the club. His next move kept him in the MLS, with New York Red Bulls snapping him up in January 2014, although he left less than a year later.",
      "He was keen to reignite his career back in England and had trials with Swindon Town and Southend United before signing for Oldham Athletic. Looking back on that spell, he said: \"I came back [to England] in January [2015] and for the first few weeks, nothing came about. I was waiting, waiting and waiting and nothing was available.",
      "\"I ended up signing for Oldham but I didn't enjoy my time there. By that time, I think I realised that I didn't really want to play football anymore. I was on the way out and I wasn't enjoying playing.\"",
      "At 26, while crossing the Irish Sea on a ferry from the Isle of Man, Eckersley decided to hang up his boots for good. He wanted to discover what else life could offer that would bring him even closer to his family.",
      "\"My daughter was born in the June and I literally stopped playing,\" he said. \"I wasn't interested in making any calls to my agent and I wasn't interested in football.",
      "\"We went to this wedding on the Isle of Man, we were hanging out as a family, just the three of us, and on the way back I was like, 'I really enjoyed that, I want to do it more often. I don't just want to keep being moved to here, there and everywhere, trying to find a career in football.'",
      "\"I felt that it was telling me something and that I needed to do something different. That was the reason that I said to my wife on the way back, 'I'm done, I'm not going to continue with this, I'm going to do something different'.\"",
      "What followed wasn't your typical ex-footballer tale. Determined to start afresh for himself and his family, Eckersley, alongside his wife and daughter, journeyed to Totnes in Devon in a camper van.",
      "They immediately fell in love with the town, so much so that they chose to relocate there for good. Eckersley was determined to contribute something meaningful to the local community and launched a shop. With a deep passion for vegan and organic produce, Eckersley and his wife established Earth.Food.Love, pioneering zero-waste retail outlet.",
      "He said: \"We wanted to find somewhere where we wanted to live; it wasn't the zero-waste shop that came first, it was where we wanted to live.",
      "\"We were living in a city centre apartment near Spinningfields [in Manchester] and we wanted to move somewhere where there was nature, vegan alternatives and all these kinds of things that we had picked up on our road leading up to this point.",
      "\"Obviously, having lived in Toronto and New York, you get access to these alternatives. Living in Manchester, there are alternatives, of course, but I felt to choose a place where we wanted to live was the cornerstone.",
      "\"We sat on the beach [near Totnes] and said that we wanted to make this our home. Obviously, we need to do something while we're here. We wanted to invest back into the community. The idea of a shop came about and, initially, the idea was that it was going to be a whole foods shop.",
      "\"There was already a whole foods shop in Totnes. We thought about what else we could do that makes us unique. The idea of a zero-waste aspect whole foods shop was unique and would draw people in. That was how it started.\"",
      "Besides operating Earth.Food.Love, Eckersley also runs ReRooted, which produces plant milks that are now distributed across the UK. Despite how hectic managing two distinct enterprises can be, Eckersley is enjoying life.",
      "\"I don't finish at 2pm anymore,\" he quipped, referring back to his football days. \"Those days are pretty much gone. But there is flexibility.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like I am getting pulled from pillar to post. But it is a joy because it is something that I am enjoying doing. It doesn't feel like a chore and it doesn't feel like I am working a 9-5 job.\"",
      "Despite only making a few appearances for United, Eckersley reveals he's often recognised by customers in the shop, leading to requests for him to participate in charity matches.",
      "\"I am just like, after a long day in the shop or at my other company, I am a little bit knackered,\" he said. \"I just want to go home, put my kids to bed, and then probably go to bed myself.",
      "\"I don't really want to play football afterwards. I do play every now and again down on the astroturf at the local school, but it is very fleeting.\"",

      "Mathieu Debuchy slammed Arsene Wenger for blocking a potential move to Manchester United. The former Arsenal defender was candid about his wish to leave the club in December 2016 after joining from the Gunners' Sunday opponents Newcastle two years prior.",
      "The right-back was signed for around £12million, having previously enjoyed a successful period at Lille where he clinched the Ligue 1 title in 2011. In his debut season with the Gunners, Debuchy was restricted to just 15 appearances across all competitions due to injuries.",
      "Upon regaining full fitness, he found it difficult to replace Hector Bellerin as the first-choice right-back. In the 2015/16 season, he only played twice before securing a loan move to Bordeaux in the January transfer window, hoping to secure a spot in France's Euro 2016 squad.",
      "Despite returning to his home country, Debuchy expressed frustration over how he was treated at Arsenal. He claimed that the Gunners had stopped a possible move to Premier League rivals United a year earlier and admitted that he barely spoke with Wenger.",
      "Reflecting on his proposed move to Old Trafford, Debuchy told L’Equipe, as per ESPN: \"I wasn't playing a lot, it was United, there's nothing else to say.",
      "\"For me, it was almost unexpected, but the coach said no. It's something I did not appreciate. He wasn't using me, so I didn't see his interest in doing that.\"",
      "When asked about his relationship with veteran Arsenal boss Wenger, Debuchy revealed he barely communicated with his fellow Frenchman. \"We acknowledge each other, we say hello, nothing more,\" he added.",
      "Debuchy claimed that Arsenal had blocked his transfer to Old Trafford, forcing him to join Bordeaux, where he featured nine times. Despite rumoured interest from clubs including Espanyol and Fiorentina, he couldn't secure a permanent switch and encountered a similar scenario once more in December 2016, though fitness issues prevented him from securing a fresh start.",
      "\"My situation doesn't meet what I had been hoping for, but that's football,\" he said. \"There have been things, injuries and the coach's choices that have meant that I haven't played. Even if I don't understand, I'm not surprised, I know how it works. [I want] a way out. I want to take on a new challenge, to get back into it, to simply do my job properly.\"",
      "However, Debuchy's accusations didn't go unanswered. Arsenal manager Wenger rejected the notion that Arsenal had prevented a potential switch to United and also addressed other transfer speculation concerning the defender.",
      "\"They have never made an offer for him,\" Wenger said, as per the Guardian. \"It's completely untrue. It's sometimes surprising to hear things like that.",
      "\"When he had the opportunities to play when Bellerín was injured, he was injured [too]. So I cannot do anything about that. I gave him last year the opportunity to go to Bordeaux on loan, but we had nobody coming in for him over the summer period and there are some things that are not true in this article.",
      "\"We never blocked him to go to Fiorentina, nor Espanyol. They had no interest in him at all because we checked that, so you have to take this [L'Equipe] article with a little distance.\"",
      "Debuchy eventually got his wish to leave Arsenal in January 2018, six months before his Gunners contract expired. He moved to Saint Etienne without a transfer fee and remained there for three and a half years. He then enjoyed a two-year stint with Valenciennes before retiring in 2023.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's 3-1 defeat to Brentford was dubbed \"a joke\" by Usain Bolt. Exiled defender Tyrell Malacia also sent the Red Devils' head coach a telling message.",
      "Amorim's men suffered their third loss of the new Premier League season on Saturday when they travelled to the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees striker Igor Thiago fired in a first-half double before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back, and although United were given a penalty on 76 minutes, Bruno Fernandes failed to convert.",
      "Brentford bagged a third goal to seal United's fate deep in added time, and during a calamitous first half, one of the club's more high-profile fans, 100m and 200m world record holder Bolt, branded the performance a \"joke.\"",
      "Brentford's first goal on Saturday saw Harry Maguire play striker Thiago onside before he slotted home past Altay Bayindir after just nine minutes. Less than 10 minutes later, and it was 2-0, the Brazilian bagging his second, with United's goalkeeper parrying a cross into his path.",
      "This disastrous opening 20 minutes had some fans up in arms, and even Bolt couldn't help but voice his frustrations. He took to social media and posted to X: \"This must be a joke.\"",
      "Fans in the comments of this post were equally as frustrated, with one writing: \"United are a joke. Have been for a decade.\" Another added: \"Even Bolt cannot believe how useless this club is.\"",
      "Although Sesko pulled one back for the visitors, his first goal for the club, Amorim's side were yet again defeated. The Portuguese head coach is yet to win two consecutive Premier League matches in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Away from the Brentford clash, outcast Malacia has proven to potential suitors and Amorim that he is ready to play. Failing to secure a move away this summer was another blow for the Dutchman, who has endured a torrid spell in Manchester after being brought to the club under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Though he arrived as a potential starting full-back, Malacia has found minutes tough to come by. He was sidelined for over 500 days after suffering a knee injury in 2023, which hasn't helped his cause.",
      "Moves to Elche in Spain and Turkey didn't materialise over the summer, after he spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV. Now, Malacia finds himself in exile, not suited to Amorim's wing-backed formation.",
      "However, the 26-year-old has indicated that he is ready to lace up his boots again, posting to Instagram videos of himself training at non-league side Trafford FC. He has shown both Amorim and any coaches of clubs who could look to take him on in January that he is keeping match-fit.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was introduced after 66 minutes against Brentford, and while he failed to make too much of an impact, he has shown glimpses of promise in recent weeks. Amorim continues to play Manuel Ugarte at the base of his midfield, however.",
      "Red Devils icon Ferdinand thinks the head coach must do all he can to get Mainoo more minutes, and he told the MEN: \"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it, being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself.",
      "\"But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim retains the backing of Manchester United's board after defeat to Brentford.",
      "Amorim was hoping to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time against Brentford, but United suffered a further setback at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Club sources have said Amorim retains the backing of Old Trafford decision-makers and no replacement is being lined up.",
      "Last month, United were forced to clarify that Amorim would not be axed after losing against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The win against Chelsea improved the mood, but United were unable to build on that result against Brentford. Amorim has won just 34 points from a possible 99 in the top flight during his time in charge.",
      "Speaking after Brentford, Amorim said: \"I know guys. We talk about this every time our team lose [basic mistakes]. We need to work on a lot of things. And again today, my biggest concern is we didn't settle down the game in the final third.",
      "\"We missed a lot of crosses. We suffered goals in transition that we knew during the week and work on that. So that is the things that we need to improve.\"",
      "Amorim was asked how United will improve and responded: \"We work on everything. The frustration is that every goal, the goals today, we work on that during the week. That is frustrating.",
      "\"We can do better with the ball. We can have more control. We can understand that sometimes when the decisions are not in our favour, the momentum is not in our favour.",
      "\"We can control the ball. We can settle down the game. That is something that I know this team can do. But when everything, the moments, the penalty, the foul before the first goal, all these things are against us.",
      "\"We need to have more personality to control the games, calm down the games and then to play better. I'm sure you're not suggesting that the referee's decision contributed to the final result.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag survived the October international break at the beginning of last season, but the Dutchman was dismissed by Ineos shortly after the resumption of domestic football.",
      "United play Sunderland at Old Trafford before the October international break begins.",

      "Ruben Amorim received a comforting tap on the back from a Manchester United staff member in the bowels of the Gtech Community Stadium after finishing his press conference.",
      "Amorim spoke for six minutes and 12 seconds during his post-match address to the media. And it's starting to feel like United's head coach is on borrowed time in Manchester.",
      "Amorim praised United's aggression against Chelsea, but that was absent against Brentford, who did not look like the team that had suffered a bad defeat the previous weekend.",
      "The warning signs were there from the first whistle. Brentford found pockets of space to exploit and Amorim did not look pleased, pacing up and down the touchline with his water bottle.",
      "Nathan Collins should have received a red card for bringing Bryan Mbeumo to the ground, but Bruno Fernandes did not convert the penalty. That decision went against United, but they were not good enough.",
      "Amorim chugged water and dropped his bottle to the floor when Mathias Jensen scored Brentford's third goal. He looked like a manager on the brink, although United sources have insisted he retains the backing of the board and no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Speaking before Brentford, Amorim said: \"It's normal the fans don't know what is going to happen in the next game. To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager.\"",
      "Amorim was not joking when he said he doesn't know which version will turn up, but that is the reason many fans are starting to believe he is not the manager to take United forward.",
      "It's worrying that Amorim still needs to micromanage his players during matches, despite being in charge for 11 months. His behaviour on the touchline hasn't changed from his first game against Ipswich Town.",
      "Every football manager gives instructions from the touchline during matches, but the extent to which Amorim must gesture for players to get into the areas he wants is a red flag.",
      "There have been concerns with the system from the moment Amorim was appointed. Some loyal season ticket holders questioned why a coach who plays a formation that does not align with United's traditional philosophy had been appointed, while others suggested it was time for meaningful change.",
      "Amorim is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and has joked that even the Pope could not make him change his approach. That stubbornness may prove to be his undoing at Old Trafford.",
      "The outlook for the weeks ahead looked significantly better after a spirited Chelsea victory, but Amorim was unable to win back-to-back league games for the first time. United continue to take one step forward and two steps back, which has made progress impossible.",
      "The underlying data suggest United have improved this season, but a spreadsheet will not save Amorim from the chopping block - securing wins and moving up the league table will.",
      "The three games sandwiched between the September and October international breaks felt huge for Amorim, although it's illogical to decide his future on a game-by-game basis.",
      "What would change if United win against Sunderland before the October break? It feels like a victory would only delay the inevitable, but it's not a surprise that Ineos are dithering.",
      "Amorim was Omar Berrada's appointment. Jason Wilcox has been the driving force behind recruitment since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment. It reflects badly on United's chiefs if they decide to sack Amorim.",
      "United spent £215million in the summer transfer window and Amorim has no excuses not to make it work. However, a roaring success story is now required for him to turn it around.",
      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Amorim on the final day of last season, and a banner with those words has recently been unfurled in the Stretford End to show support for him.",
      "It will be interesting to see whether that banner is raised against Sunderland this weekend.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however uncomfortable and embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach who can steer the club out of their current crisis.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and an equally lamentable haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation at Brentford.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Erik ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way.",
      "Amorim has failed to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, something even the doomed David Moyes managed in his ill-fated spell in charge, and United have regressed under the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach.",
      "Players are starting to lose faith in Amorim and his methods, in particular his intransigence over his controversial 3-4-3 system, even when it is patently clear to see that the personnel he has at his disposal are ill-suited to it and cannot get to grips with it.",
      "Amorim's insistence on playing skipper Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, rather than in a more advanced attacking position where he is more comfortable and effective, is an act of self-sabotage, with United's talisman having scored just once from open play this season.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe last season – only the second time in 35 years United have suffered that fate - was framed as a blessing in disguise by Amorim, the free weeks meaning it would give him and his staff more time to work with the players on the system and philosophy.",
      "But that theory has been blown apart by United's miserable start to the season, as has the bold rhetoric from United that a full pre-season under Amorim, coupled with £236million worth of new signings, would make the team stronger from the get-go. United are currently languishing in 14th spot, one place above where they finished last season, with a goal difference of minus four, while their humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town means they now have even fewer games in which to address their shortcomings, as well as seeing one route to a trophy closed off.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casemiro's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing, but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for Amorim to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment, but there is no shame in admitting that was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it, in the face of such overwhelming evidence.",
      "United did so with former sporting director Dan Ashworth, jettisoning him after just five months, and must now do the same with Amorim, before the crisis deepens, leaving the team facing an ugly relegation battle – a genuine possibility given their current precarious position.",

      "Manchester United's transfer record in recent years makes for pretty ugly reading.",
      "The Reds have spent heavily with little success as they bid to recapture past glories. Ruben Amorim splashed the cash again this summer with up to more than £200million shelled out on attacking trio Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "But since Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe invested at Old Trafford, there has been a shift in recruitment policy. The big-money names have still arrived but beneath that United have invested more in potential, with several prospects having arrived in recent years.",
      "Chido Obi is perhaps the most high-profile having arrived from Arsenal in 2024 while Ayden Heaven also joined from the Gunners. And United have looked abroad when scouting for the next superstars, with the likes of Sekou Kone and Enzo Kana-Biyik arriving over the past 18 months, Diego Leon joining in the summer and last week the Reds reached a preliminary agreement to sign teenage midfielder Cristian Orozco.",
      "Orozco, 17, plays for Fortaleza CEIF and has captained Colombia's Under-17 team. The defensive midfielder will not be able to complete a move to Old Trafford until he turns 18 next year and will officially join in July.",
      "Spotting the best young talent from all corners of the globe can pay off handsomely and United have the opportunity to spot their next prospect during the Under-20 World Cup.",
      "The tournament got under way last week in Chile and there is a raft of youngsters tipped to make major breakthroughs in South America.",
      "United have already been linked with two players - Nigerian goalkeeper Ebenezer Harcourt who is just 15 and 16-year-old Mexico wonderkid Gilberto Mora, who has had reported interest from several top European clubs.",
      "With Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero and Paul Pogba past winners of the player of the tournament, and Erling Haaland the top scorer in the 2019 edition, the competition can offer an indicator of the future.",
      "For Ineos and United there is the chance to see how talented teenagers fare in tournament play and potentially identify the next young stars to join the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "England have failed to qualify but there is a raft of talent in action. Prospects from Argentina and Brazil stand out with 19-year-old forward Pedro, who joined Zenit in Russia in 2024, tipped to shine for the latter.",
      "Argentina have a clutch of prospects with Maher Carrizo catching the eye in his homeland for Velez Sarsfield. The 19-year-old right winger has 10 goals in 31 games this season.",
      "Away from Argentina and Brazil, Mexico midfielder Obed Vargas, who has caught the eye for Seattle Sounders in the MLS, and Spanish centre back Jon Martin, who has broken through at Real Sociedad, are also highly rated.",
      "Scouts from across the globe will be keeping a keen eye on the tournament, and United could be at the front of the queue.",

      "Last weekend's win against Chelsea improved the mood at Old Trafford, but United were unable to build on that result. Amorim has won just 34 points from a possible 99 in the top flight during his time in charge and the Brentford defeat will increase the pressure on his shoulders.",

      "De Ligt was the only United player to take time to speak to reporters as the players left the Gtech Community Stadium. The Dutchman was not included in the leadership group that was formed in the summer, but he is understood to have taken on a leadership role in the dressing room regardless.",
      "\"Really disappointed because all week we were speaking about keeping the momentum going, getting another win under our belt and yeah, if you lose this game, it's a big blow obviously,\" he said.",
      "\"Not a nice feeling, obviously. Everybody is really disappointed. I think first of all, they are disappointed with themselves. The first thing you have to control is yourself. And if you can do that, you are first disappointed with yourself, and then also with the team and the whole result, so really disappointed.\"",
      "De Ligt stressed United must stick together. \"It's the most important thing, it's the only thing we can do,\" he said. \"As I said, it's a lot of time the same song, but still we have to stick together.",
      "\"We lost against City, we won against Chelsea, so for the next game we have to analyse what went wrong in this game because a lot of things went wrong. We need to be prepared for the next game.\"",
      "When asked about what went wrong against Brentford, he responded: \"We were short in key moments where we made the wrong decisions. That makes a big difference in football.",
      "\"I think obviously we were quite unlucky also with some chances, but yeah, overall, it was not good enough. That's a fact. Then you know, against a team like Brentford who play on the transition, with long throw-ins and corner kicks, then it's going to be really difficult.\"",
      "De Ligt was signed by Erik ten Hag and the anniversary of his sacking is next month. Amorim looked like a manager under pressure on the touchline against Brentford, but De Ligt insisted the players must deliver on the pitch and cut out the mistakes that are leading to goals.",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" he said about taking responsibility. \"I mean it's always easy to look to the manager, but in the end, the players on the pitch have to do it. We can't say the goals we conceded, or the chances we conceded, are because of what... I don't know, you guys always talk about the system.",

      "\"It was the long ball to the strikers, the counter-attack. The first goal, I haven't seen it back. Obviously it was really tight. And yeah, then it's difficult. You're 1-0 behind, which is what you don't want.",
      "\"And then it goes 2-0 quite quickly afterwards. We came back quite well, we make it 2-1 and get a penalty. In my opinion... I'm not going to say [it was a red card], but the rules are the rules. But still, we have to do it ourselves and we didn't do it today. That's really disappointing.\"",

      "Rashford helped the Catalan side come from behind at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium as they overcame Real Sociedad after the visitors took the lead through Alvaro Odriozola after 31 minutes. The 27-year-old England international stepped up to show his ability from a dead ball and found Jules Kounde from a corner to level the scores shortly before half-time.",

      "Rashford's assist was his third of the season, bringing his total goal involvements for the term to five. The Carrington product has the joint-most goal involvements across all competitions for his new side, matching Ferran Torres and Raphinha following his latest effort.",
      "United's new forward line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko has managed just three goal involvements so far. The latter netted his first goal in United colours in the defeat to Brentford, with Amorim's side barely averaging a goal per game once again.",
      "Following his latest success with Barca, Rashford took to Instagram and said: \"Huge 3 points! Let’s keep pushing.\"",

United will have been hoping that their 2-1 victory over Chelsea last Saturday could signal a turning point as they aim to build momentum under the former Sporting boss.",
      "Despite Benjamin Sesko netting his first goal for United, a first-half brace from Igor Thiago and a late strike from Mathias Jensen ensured the Reds left West London with nothing. The loss has piled on more pressure for Amorim following last season's disappointing 15th-place finish - United's lowest in the Premier League era.",

      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to frustrate and infuriate him and United's fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "Here, the seeds of their latest setback were sewn inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals, the United boss left shaking his head at his team's continued failings.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after the United chief executive went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stats that matter are the results, which have been lamentable.",
      "Amoirm has still to win back-to-back Premier League games, despite being in charge for nearly a year, another shocking stat for the embattled head coach.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the side that secured a hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea a week earlier, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the 'keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later. Brentford again exposed United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, only for Thaigo to steer it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort.",
      "Next up for United is Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same was as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",

      "Mount had started each of United's first three games of the new Premier League season before picking up a knock in the 3-2 win over Burnley. The England international missed the Manchester Derby, and he made his return off the bench in the 2-1 victory against Chelsea.",
      "Mount appeared again at the weekend, but he couldn't claw back a point for Amorim's side. Shortly after coming on, Mathias Jensen put the third and final nail in United's coffin after a quick break.",
      "Speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast at St. James' Park on Sunday evening, Neville reflected on the result at the G-Tech Community Stadium. The United legend described the decision to play Mount at left wing-back again as 'absolutely ridiculous'.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"There was something that happened in that game that I mentioned on my podcast two or three weeks ago that I said we couldn't see again,\" said Neville. \"I said that Mason Mount ended up at left wing-back.",
      "\"There's sticking to your plan, and then there's your coach that's got an idea and making sure that he delivers that idea and not flip-flopping with his idea with players, which can sometimes undermine what you're trying to achieve.",
      "“But then when you're putting Mason Mount at left wing-back – and he's ended up at left wing-back again at Brentford in the last five minutes of the game – it starts to look awful.\"",
      "He added: \"You can't put Mason Mount at left wing-back. I'm sorry, it just can't happen. I can't watch Mason Mount play left wing-back in a football team.",
      "\"I struggled at times to watch him in his natural position, but actually putting him out there on the left wing, is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "On United, Neville said: I'm very worried. The performance that we saw and the result at Brentford means that you feel the Chelsea game was skewed by the sending off.",
      "\"You start to look at the Chelsea win less positively. That's just football. I think there are a lot of United fans coming out of that ground last Saturday, including me, thinking, 'Brentford away, Sunderland at home next week has a real opportunity to get nine points on the board, on the bounce, and then you'll be well up in the top six or eight'.",
      "\"But the Brentford game was a really poor performance and a real worry. I felt for the first time, just through instinct, watching it on the television, seeing players' faces and body language, that there might be an element of players really doubting the system and what's going on.\"",

Despite denying a goalscoring opportunity, Collins escaped with a caution before his blushes were spared after a save from Caoimhin Kelleher to deny Bruno Fernandes.",

      "\"He can't be in control of the ball because someone is pulling him back, he's a yard from the ball, clearly.",
      "\"Yes, [Fernandes] had to wait four-and-a-half minutes before getting to that decision but that's a mistake from him. [Collins] should have been sent off - absolutely no doubt about it.\"",

      "Manchester United appear to have been told how much it would cost for them to sign Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher.",
      "United have recently been credited with an interest in signing Gallagher, with The Mirror reporting that the former Chelsea midfielder is a target for the Reds. There have been suggestions that Gallagher is viewed as a 'Plan B' for United in the event they fail to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton.",
      "A reported price tag of more than £100million is thought to be the key reason that stopped United from signing Baleba during the summer transfer window. Various reports have claimed that United still have an interest in Baleba, but now it seems that the club may have Gallagher in their thoughts as the New Year approaches.",
      "Spanish news outlet Mundo Deportivo has claimed that Atletico may be willing to sanction Gallagher's exit if their asking price is met. It has been reported that the La Liga outfit value Gallagher at €60million (£52.4million) ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "It remains to be seen if United would be willing to meet that asking price, or if they will be determined to try and sign Baleba at their next opportunity. Gallagher only signed for Atletico in the summer of 2024 for price tag reported to be in the region of £34million.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim is coming under increased pressure after Manchester United lost again in the Premier League.",
      "Having beaten Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford last weekend, Amorim had the chance to earn back-to-back league wins for the first time since he joined United nearly a year ago.",
      "But once again, he failed, overseeing a poor 3-1 defeat away to Brentford. United were battered in the opening stages before a goal from Benjamin Sesko, his first for the club, gave them hope of a comeback.",
      "But when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty after a bizzare decision not to show Brentford's Nathan Collins a red card, it became clear that it wouldn't be United's day. The Bees added a third in stoppage time, condemning Amorim to his 17th league defeat in just 33 games.",
      "Now speculation over his position is intensifying, as MEN Sport takes a look at a new development.",
      "Gareth Southgate is reportedly on Manchester United's three-man shortlist to potentially replace Amorim - and he's already been in direct contact with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. That's according to talkSPORT, who report that United are likely to wait until November to pull the trigger.",
      "This would be to reduce the level of compensation, as Amorim will've been in charge for 12 months. Ratcliffe has reportedly been in contact with Southgate in recent weeks to gauge the possibility of him taking over, having been out of work since resigning as England manager in July 2024.",
      "The two other options that United reportedly have shortlisted are Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. Southgate, 55, was heavily linked to the role prior to his England exit, and his name was also mentioned during the process of appointing Amorim, who could have four games to save his job.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Gareth Southgate has made it increasingly clear that he's decided to move away from football management. In December 2024, the former England boss told the BBC: \"I've been 37 years a player and coach, and I'm not against the next period of my life being totally different. When you've had one of the biggest jobs, how do you follow that up?\"",
      "\"Southgate's comments suggest that he's looking for leadership roles outside of football, as he's hinted at during other media appearances since leaving the Wembley hot seat. Perhaps Sir Jim Ratcliffe is trying to convince Southgate to change his mind, but without ex-FA chief Dan Ashworth on board at United, it seems far-fetched that Southgate would get the job at this point - if he even wants it.",
      "\"Some would argue, though, that United is an even bigger job than managing England, so maybe it is a worthy next role. But the stars don't feel aligned, and given Glasner and Iraola's current careers in the Premier League, they look more suitable candidates for what United are trying to build.\"",
      "The Manchester United hierarchy, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe, remain in full support of Ruben Amorim, according to BBC Sport. Their report dismisses speculation that a shortlist has been drawn up, insisting that Old Trafford chiefs are fully backing the Portguese to turn things around.",
      "Ratcliffe feels that it's only fair to judge Amorim over the course of a full season with what the United co-owner views as the right squad to make progress. Sources add that no one is currently being lined up.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Sir Jim Ratcliffe is once again showing patience with a Manchester United manager. He allowed Erik ten Hag to continue despite a dreadful 2023-24 season, backing him with a summer of spending before ultimately pulling the plug, trusting fellow bigwigs Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada's judgement.",
      "\"But he's playing a dangerous game as ire builds up within the fan base. Constant false dawns are filling United supporters with apathy and if results don't improve, it'll only be a matter of time before things turn toxic at matches.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former France international Emmanuel Petit has previously claimed that Zinedine Zidane would need demands to be met before taking charge of Manchester United. The Champions League-winning head coach has been mentioned in the conversation to replace Ruben Amorim as pressure mounts.",
      "United failed to make it back-to-back wins as they failed to build on last weekend's triumph over Chelsea, with Brentford running out 3-1 winners on Saturday. Two first-half strikes from Igor Thiago gave the visitors a mountain to climb following a slow start in the capital.",
      "Benjamin Sesko reduced the arrears, netting his first for the club, before Bruno Fernandes squandered a golden opportunity from the spot to level proceedings 15 minutes from time.",
      "Mathias Jensen rounded off the scoring deep into stoppage to compound a miserable afternoon for the travelling United contingent.",
      "It leaves United in 14th on seven points as Keith Andrews' side leapfrogged them with their triumph.",
      "Amorim continues to face speculation over an exit after failing to arrest their inconsistency and poor form. It has led to Zidane being linked with the post, but should a decision be taken, they will have to coax the former Real Madrid head coach in from the cold.",
      "Zidane has not been in the dugout since 2021 after leaving Los Blancos for a second time. In order to do so, Petit, one of his former teammates, says demands will have to be met.",
      "\"Honestly, I know a little bit, Zizou [Zidane], and he needs to get guarantees if he wants to sign over there in Manchester United,\" Petit said in 2024.",
      "\"At the moment, the environment at Manchester United for years has not been good. The stability of the bench, the level of the players as well, the expectation of the club is not the same that it used to be.",
      "\"United is still a huge club, but not on the pitch anymore. And Zizou is very conscious and very careful about that, the quality of the players.\"",
      "He added: \"Could he manage to overturn the situation over there? I think the only answer is yes. But at the moment, when you look at the team, I'm not convinced at all about the level of some players.",
      "\"So if I am Zizou, I think it will be very easy, actually, to answer this question [of joining United]. If I don't speak English on top of it, that will be more problems in terms of communication in the dressing room.",
      "\"If he takes the job at Manchester United, that means he's got solutions. At the moment, I'm not sure a lot of people have the solution to turn the situation at Manchester United.",
      "\"Does he want to leave the sunny days of Madrid? His life is in Madrid, he is dedicated to Madrid.",
      "\"I'm not sure that he speaks very good English as well. And communication is very important in the dressing room.\"",

    "body": [
      "\"Today is Nick Cox's last day. How on earth that has been allowed to happen is beyond me,\" read a text from a contact.",
      "Cox has departed Manchester United after nine years of service, six of which were spent as head of the academy.",
      "In that time, Cox played a pivotal role in United's academy renaissance, helped 35 players make their senior debuts, secured top youth signings and oversaw an FA Youth Cup triumph.",
      "Cox already had a foot through the exit door when the Under-21s played at Old Trafford in midweek, but he is understood to have followed the game. He would have smiled as the youngsters scored a last-minute winner at the Stretford End. That is the kind of experience he spoke so warmly about.",
      "United are losing an integral cog in their academy. Cox has joined Everton to become their technical director and he will look back on his time in Manchester with great pride.",
      "Cox joined United from Sheffield United in 2016. He joined as academy operations manager, working alongside Nicky Butt, and was promoted to academy head three years later.",
      "\"He leaves the academy in excellent shape to continue attracting and developing world-class talent, and well-rounded young people,\" said a club statement in June announcing he would leave.",
      "Cox's main priority was supplementing the first team with academy talent, and he will look back on the players who made that step up during his tenure with huge fondness. However, he had just as much time for youngsters who didn't achieve that dream, the players whose careers were destined for elsewhere.",
      "He was self-deprecating and generous with his time during interviews. Academy staff probably dread the sight of a reporter walking over to speak after a youth game, but Cox always engaged with a smile.",
      "Covering the academy during Cox's tenure has been uplifting, especially at a time when United's first-team has often disappointed. The academy has always been there to produce special moments.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, but the Under-18s gave fans something to cheer about by reaching the FA Youth Cup semi-final. They were superb in the quarter-finals against Arsenal at the Emirates, but ran out of steam in the last four against eventual winners Aston Villa.",
      "In 2021/22, United sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and remained in the doldrums with Ralf Rangnick. That season coincided with the U18s winning the Youth Cup for the first time since 2011.",
      "That night, Cox said: \"As the kids are running across the pitch, I'm looking and I'm seeing the Under-23s, too old for the competition, there, with their mates racing across the pitch as well. That was amazing. That was a group of mates, that was a group of kids, living out their dreams tonight.\"",
      "The Class of '22 were a supremely talented bunch of young players. Alejandro Garnacho was the star of the team, but the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Dan Gore and Rhys Bennett sparkled.",
      "Cox tells the story of how United signed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid in 2020. Garnacho, then 16, was persuaded to join over Zoom while Cox's children bickered about a video game in the background.",
      "Garnacho made 144 senior appearances for United. The winger scored against Manchester City in the 2024 FA Cup final and was sold for £40million in the summer, making him United's fourth-highest sale in their history.",
      "Through Cox's leadership, the academy regained its reputation. Facilities at Carrington improved, allowing the club to keep talents like Mainoo, who in previous years might have signed for City.",
      "Mainoo joined the club's academy aged nine, but he spent time with United and City before then. The midfielder chose to join United's academy and although City attempted to lure him away at ages when it would have been possible, he chose to stay each time.",
      "Cox understood the importance of talent retention, but recruitment was equally important during his tenure. Alvaro Fernandez arrived in the same transfer window as Garnacho in 2020 and now plays for Real Madrid.",
      "Fernandez was educated at Carrington in the latter stages of his development and feels like the one that got away. Erik ten Hag overlooked Fernandez, but academy staff are proud of his journey since leaving.",
      "More recently, Cox played a pivotal role in the signings of Toby Collyer, Harry Amass, Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi. The opportunity to sign Collyer, regarded as one of the finest young midfielders in England, came about unexpectedly, but Cox's work helped United to be at the front of the queue for his signature.",
      "Club sources were keen to give Cox the credit he deserved for signing Obi from Arsenal, describing his work as \"crucial\". The young striker's arrival last year was considered a genuine coup.",
      "Cox told the MEN: \"Because he holds a Danish passport, the whole of Europe was open to Chido. We quite simply became aware of the fact that Chido was about to make a move to Europe.",
      "\"He’d been to visit a club and identified the club where he was going to potentially end up. We thought if this player is available and is looking to leave, then we should make every effort we possibly can to sign him.",
      "\"The pretty familiar formula for Manchester United's senior and youth teams has always been having the best local players and adding some of the best talent from further afield.",
      "\"If you look back, it's George Best, it's Bobby Charlton, or it's Duncan Edwards from further afield, added to a group of local lads. Then fast forward and it's someone like Paul Pogba.\"",
      "The statistics from Cox's time at the club read well. United academy graduates played 25 per cent of first-team minutes between 2019 and 2024 - only second to Bayern Munich in the top five leagues - and United ranked second in the Premier League for minutes given to teenagers last season.",
      "Cox oversaw the continuation of United’s record of including an academy in every first-team matchday squad for over 4,200 games. That record has recently seemed under threat.",
      "The U18s won three national trophies in 2023/2024. And in the last two seasons, the U13s, U14s and U15s have been national champions. Delivering results was crucial, but Cox genuinely cared about the academy and his passion for youth development was obvious when you spoke to him.",
      "Cox was well-versed in the club's rich academy history. He wanted children to understand they were following in the footsteps of legendary United academy graduates each day.",
      "The 47-year-old became a patron of the Manchester Munich Memorial Foundation and visited Manchesterplatz as part of an academy delegation. “It is my job, in part, to make sure that our youth players fully understand and embrace the great legacy and history of our football club,\" he said.",
      "Cox was born in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, but felt part Mancunian due to his lengthy association with United.",
      "He deserves credit for establishing the academy alumni programme, which has ensured that former players remain actively engaged with the academy and receive access to support, help and advice.",
      "United's has been a forward-thinking academy. They were the first academy in England to introduce a player-coach role with the U21s, something that Liverpool subsequently copied.",
      "The pro experience programme was created, which saw young players train with EFL and non-league clubs while still playing for the academy to prepare them for potential loans.",
      "Cox helped raise £100m from academy sales, but he never wanted the academy building to become a cash cow for first-team signings. Of course, academy sales have become important due to Profit and Sustainability Rules, but Cox was an advocate of promoting talent from within.",
      "Cox faced challenges along the way. The academy has been United's only well-functioning area in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but that hasn't stopped Ineos from making changes.",
      "When mass redundancies were made, the academy lost talented staff members. Cox has worked in difficult circumstances at Carrington over the last 18 months, with reduced resources due to cost-cutting.",
      "Ineos scaled back the coverage of the academy on MUTV. There is still no dedicated social media account for academy content, or a specialised junior communications executive for media enquiries. That means existing resources and staff members have been stretched, often working long hours.",
      "It will be a near-impossible task for Cox's successor, Stephen Torpey, to emulate his work.",
      "Cox leaves behind a wonderful legacy. Just ask the players who worked with him.",

      "Manchester United lost 3-1 against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Brentford made an excellent start to the game, taking a two-goal lead within 20 minutes after a brace from Igor Thiago, giving United a mountain to climb at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit before the interval. United had a golden chance to draw level when Bryan Mbeumo won a penalty with 15 minutes remaining, but Bruno Fernandes' low effort was saved by Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Brentford wrapped up the victory with an injury-time goal from Mathias Jensen.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "The system is a problem",
      "Brentford opened the scoring far too easily, launching a long ball forward after stifling an attack from United. Harry Maguire was isolated and Thiago lashed the ball beyond Altay Bayindir.",
      "It was concerning that Brentford were able to bypass United's entire team with a simple long ball. There had been instances of the team looking disjointed before that breakthrough, with a large gap between the backline and attack, so the manner of Brentford's goal wasn't surprising.",
      "Ruben Amorim finally had a chance to address the problem when Sesko halved the deficit, which allowed him to usher Maguire and Luke Shaw to the touchline to receive tactical instructions.",
      "United's head coach should not need to address the space between the backline, midfield and attack at this stage of his tenure. That should be second nature to his players.",
      "The problem is part of the ongoing conversation around Amorim's system and the debate about whether he will succeed at Old Trafford with his approach. He is still yet to win back-to-back league games.",
      "The chant from United's fans",
      "The tempo dropped after play resumed for the second half and there was a worrying lack of urgency from United, who were trailing by a goal and supposed to be trying to find a way back into the game.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" pleaded the travelling away support. It all looked far too pedestrian, despite Amorim trying to gee up his players from the sidelines.",
      "There was hope United would build on their Chelsea victory but it's another false dawn.",
      "The reception for Mainoo",
      "There was a loud cheer when Kobbie Mainoo was introduced to the game in the 66th minute. Many wondered whether Mainoo would be given his first start of the Premier League season against Brentford, but Manuel Ugarte was selected to start alongside Fernandes instead.",
      "Ugarte was wasteful, losing possession far too often. The 24-year-old is not having a good season and the reaction to Mainoo's introduction hinted United fans think he should be involved more often.",
      "It didn't take long for Mainoo to offer what Ugarte did not. The youngster escaped a tight space with the ball at his feet, and impressively broke up a Brentford attack moments later.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo has been questionable this season.",
      "Cunha showed his frustration",
      "It didn't take long for Cunha to become frustrated with how the game was unfolding. He tried to encourage his teammates as they prepared for the restart following Thiago's opener and became animated with Sesko when he picked the wrong pass, which botched a sweeping move forward.",
      "Cunha had further words with Sesko when the ball went out of play for a throw-in. The Brazilian isn't afraid to dish out orders to his teammates and Amorim has praised that part of his character.",
      "However, it works both ways, and Cunha can make wrong decisions on the ball himself, just like when he chose to shoot from the edge of the box instead of sliding Fernandes through.",
      "Cunha, Sesko and Mbeumo started together for the first time against Brentford and there were teething problems.",
      "Mbeumo reunion",
      "Mbeumo returned to the Gtech Community Stadium for the first time since signing for United for £65m in the summer. The forward spent six successful years with Brentford and left on good terms.",
      "Before the warm-ups began, Mbeumo chatted with his former teammates on the pitch and seemed in good spirits. He shared an embrace with a handful of his former colleagues, and Brentford's supporters gave Mbeumo a loud cheer when the stadium announcer read out his name.",
      "Mbeumo scored in Brentford's 4-0 hammering of United in August 2022 when Erik ten Hag was in charge, and memories of that game came flooding back as the Bees took a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes.",
      "The Cameroon international played a brilliant cross into the box in the second half, but nobody was there to connect with it. Mbeumo didn't have that problem during his stint with Brentford.",
      "\"Bryan, what's the score?\" sang Brentford's fans at the end of the game.",

      "“We never settled down to play our game. We never pushed the opponent. We knew that every time they recovered the ball, they would make a run and they would fight for the ball.",
      "“We need to work on a lot of things. My biggest concern is that we didn't settle down in the game. In the final third we missed a lot of crosses.",
      "“That is frustrating. We can do better with the ball. We can have more control. We can understand that sometimes when the decisions are not in your favour, the momentum is not in your favour, we can still control the ball.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's 3-1 defeat to Brentford was dubbed \"a joke\" by Usain Bolt, and exiled defender Tyrell Malacia also sent the Red Devils' head coach a telling message.",
      "Amorim's side endured their third defeat of the current Premier League campaign on Saturday when they made the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees forward Igor Thiago netted a first-half brace before Benjamin Sesko reduced the deficit, and despite United being awarded a spot-kick on 76 minutes, Bruno Fernandes was unable to find the net.",
      "Brentford claimed a third strike to confirm United's downfall deep into stoppage time, and during a disastrous opening period, one of the club's most prominent supporters, 100m and 200m world record holder Bolt, labelled the display a \"joke.\"",
      "Meanwhile, ostracised left-back Malacia has delivered a statement to his boss through his training efforts, and Rio Ferdinand has cautioned the head coach that one player needs to be restored to the first team.",
      "Brentford's opener on Saturday saw Harry Maguire keep striker Thiago onside before he found the net beyond Altay Bayindir after merely nine minutes. Fewer than 10 minutes later, and it was 2-0, the Brazilian claiming his second as United's keeper pushed a delivery into his path.",
      "This catastrophic opening 20 minutes left some supporters furious, and even Bolt felt compelled to express his disappointment. He turned to social media and wrote on X: \"This must be a joke.\"",
      "Supporters in the comments section of this post shared similar frustrations, with one stating: \"United are a joke. Have been for a decade.\" Another commented: \"Even Bolt cannot believe how useless this club is.\"",
      "Despite Sesko netting his maiden goal for the visitors to reduce the deficit, Amorim's team suffered another setback. The Portuguese manager has still not managed to secure back-to-back Premier League victories since taking charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Beyond the Brentford encounter, outcast Malacia has demonstrated to prospective clubs and Amorim that he remains match-ready. Missing out on a transfer this summer represented another setback for the Netherlands international, who has endured a challenging period in Manchester following his arrival under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Despite joining as a potential first-choice full-back, Malacia has struggled for playing time. A knee problem in 2023 kept him out for more than 500 days, which certainly didn't aid his situation.",
      "Potential switches to Spanish side Elche and Turkish clubs failed to materialise during the summer window, following his loan spell at PSV in the latter half of last campaign. Currently, Malacia finds himself marginalised, unsuited to Amorim's wing-back system.",
      "Nevertheless, the 26-year-old has signalled his readiness to return to action, sharing Instagram footage of himself training at Shawe View, the home of nearby non-league outfit Trafford FC. He has demonstrated to both Amorim and managers at clubs potentially interested in a January move that he is maintaining his fitness levels.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was brought on after 66 minutes against Brentford, and whilst he struggled to leave a significant mark, he has demonstrated flashes of potential in recent weeks. Amorim persists with Manuel Ugarte at the heart of his midfield setup in the suspended Casemiro's absence, though.",
      "Red Devils legend Ferdinand believes the manager must do everything possible to secure Mainoo additional playing time. Speaking exclusively to the MEN as he fronts Talking Futures' new initiative Half Time Talks, Ferdinand said: \"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it, being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself.",
      "\"But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "According to reports, Liverpool are already ‘on the verge’ of ‘completing’ a ‘controversial’ transfer as they battle Manchester United for a signing.",
      "In the summer, Liverpool were comfortably the biggest spending club in Europe as they invested around £414.5m to secure several statement signings.",
      "The Reds broke the British transfer record twice in the same window to land Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, while they also signed Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and Giovanni Leoni.",
      "However, Liverpool’s summer window was not perfect as they missed out on Crystal Palace and England standout Marc Guehi on deadline day.",
      "It was widely reported in the summer that Liverpool were Guehi’s preferred destination and he was available for a cut-price fee as he is one of the most valuable footballers in the final year of his contract.",
      "READ: Man Utd in ‘grim ritual’, Wirtz ‘utter sh*te’ for Liverpool, Maresca ‘out now’ and… Glasner to Arsenal?",
      "However, Liverpool’s agreed £35m deal for Guehi fell through on deadline day as Crystal Palace pulled the plug after failing to secure a suitable replacement.",
      "This leaves Arne Slot’s side short at the back, with Leoni’s season-ending ACL injury leaving Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez as their only fit and natural centre-backs.",
      "Liverpool will re-enter the market for a new centre-back in 2026, and while it has been assumed that they would sign Guehi for a reduced fee in January or on a free transfer next summer, they are also linked with alternatives.",
      "Everton standout Jarrad Branthwaite, who is a long-term Man Utd target, has also been heavily linked with Liverpool, who are said to be stepping up their interest in the talented centre-back.",
      "MORE LIVERPOOL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Neville makes ‘huge’ Arsenal title claim as Liverpool ‘hearts will have sunk’ after late winner\n👉 Liverpool star has ‘one foot out’ as he’s ‘not part of Slot’s plans’ with ‘surprise replacement’ revealed\n👉 Liverpool: Richards ‘starting to worry’ as anti-Reds approach exposes weak link under Slot",
      "This is according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who have boldly claimed that the Reds are ‘on the verge’ of ‘completing one of the most controversial transfers in recent years’ to land Branthwaite.",
      "The report claims that a deal worth 74 million euros (£64.5m) has been thrashed out between Liverpool and Everton, though there is a ‘feeling of betrayal and anger’ at the latter club over this situation.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘An operation of this magnitude not only has sporting repercussions, but has also unleashed a genuine earthquake in the football world on Merseyside.",
      "‘Liverpool’s interest in Jarrad Branthwaite has been long-standing, but it has never materialised with a proposal of such a significant financial magnitude. The Reds consider the 22-year-old English centre-back a strategic investment to bolster their defence in the coming years. His physical ability, defensive leadership, and maturity despite his young age convinced the board that the €74 million fee was worth the effort.’",
      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. At Palace, the Dutch stopper kept a clean sheet despite Palace’s 1.59 xG and Forest failed to beat him despite an xG of 1.65.",
      "",
      "Of the 14 ever-presents through the first five games, no keeper has conceded fewer than the three goals Henderson has seen past him. As we’re certain he’d tell you.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list has done Trafford. Though the PSxG stat won’t account for the way he gave Tottenham the ball before their crucial second at the Etihad in his home debut for his boyhood club.",
      "",
      "The Italian has the highest saves percentage (84 per cent) in the league and only one keeper has made more saves. He was bloomin’ busy last season too.",
      "",
      "Four clean sheets in five games – still the best record in the Premier League – is keeping Aaron Ramsdale on the bench. He bumped his PSxG up against Arsenal, though that stat won’t highlight his mistake in giving Arsenal back the ball prior to their late winner.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced five shots more than any other goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "Darlow has replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form has given Daniel Farke a decision to make when Perri becomes available again next weekend.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are buzzing with their latest keeper plundered from the Chelsea stockpile, with Petrovic keeping clean sheets in half of his six appearances so far. All the more impressive when you consider that Bournemouth sold almost their entire defence.",
      "",
      "Leno is bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign. Villa scoring three from an xG of 1.11 has hurt the German here, but there is very little he could have done to prevent any of those goals.",
      "",
      "Only one keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 83.3%. Gary Neville would still prefer someone bigger.",
      "",
      "Perhaps this metric really is a nonsense because Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. At Chelsea, he looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has played half of City’s games in which he has done exactly what the algorithm would expect him to.",
      "",
      "It was handy while his side had forgotten how to score goals that Martinez was slowly making amends with Villa fans after a summer in which he flirted hard with Manchester United. For reasons unknown, the Red Devils failed to make a move.",
      "",
      "The England No.1 has conceded five goals in five games – exactly the number the stats suggest he ought to have. Though Pickford is also one of two keepers to keep out a penalty this season.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award needs to be on his game this term with only Burnley allowing more shots on target than Forest, all while Big John breathes down his neck.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",
      "Tables are fun, aren’t they? And we’ve got loads of them, based on all the metrics you could possibly need. Create your own too, between any dates or on a specific date. Enjoy yourself here.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, so why is he still masquerading as such?",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they almost certainly have if we accept the Bees need some patience while a remodelled team settles under a new manager. Defeats – both 3-1 – at Forest and Fulham cost Kelleher here, with the Cottagers scoring three from an xG of 1.0. But saving Bruno Fernandes’ penalty certainly helps.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and, despite playing one game fewer than the ever-presents, no keeper has faced a higher PSxG (9.3) than the Dane. Hermansen has not convinced anyone at the London Stadium, but he’s way down the Hammers’ list of problems.",
      "",
      "Being humped 5-0 at Arsenal has done for the £16million new boy here. In his other two appearances, Perri kept clean sheets against Everton and Newcastle. But five was two more than Arsenal ought to have scored at the Emirates, say the stats. Does he come straight back in upon his return from injury?",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 is especially damning.",
      "",
      "VAR has institutionalised ignorance and stupidity whilst selling itself as informed and clever. And it broke Bruno Fernandes on Saturday.",
      "Arsenal fans are buoyant after that win over the anti-football folk of Newcastle United, but Gabriel does deserve a slap.",
      "Surely there is nobody – not even Ruben Amorim – who thinks that Ruben Amorim should not be sacked by Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United will be weighing up the ‘eye-watering’ severance fee due to Ruben Amorim, but it wouldn’t even be in the top ten biggest manager pay-offs.",
      "Obviously it’s ridiculously early to be talking about a Premier League team of the season so far, but it’s also bloody good fun.",

      "“Brentford knew exactly how to play against them, because I’ve voiced my concerns for United before on this, that if you play a certain way, and you’re never prepared to change it, and you actually tell everybody you’re not going to change it, so everybody knows how you’re going to play, well, it’s easy to plan to play against them, isn’t it, right? Brentford had their plan, didn’t they?”",

      "“It really will be his downfall, unfortunately for him, because he’s not going to budge. He’s right, everyone else is wrong, I guess. I know they worked really hard last week for their win, but it was back to normality.”",

      "“I also said that I genuinely believe that the owners, or the people are running the club at the minute, have made that many errors in the last two years or 18 months since they’ve been there, it would look terrible to admit another error.",

      "Let me tell you something you already know: VAR has institutionalised ignorance and stupidity whilst selling itself as informed and clever. If you somehow didn’t realise that, Saturday’s Brentford v Manchester United game must surely have proved it to you.",
      "But what is VAR really? More than just an extra rule to obey, it has altered the very fabric of the game and installed a dark cloak of fear after every goal is scored, as they scour the footage desperately trying to find a reason to disallow it. And they often find something which ‘proves’ there was a miniscule offside, invisible to the naked eye, that could only be discerned in slow motion. The striker gained no advantage, but nonetheless it’s ruled out. Even though the offside rule was invented to stop a player gaining advantage by being ahead of the ball, not to find a boot ahead of the ball by an inch which doesn’t gain an advantage and can’t even be seen with the naked eye.",
      "Great moments are spoiled by its presence, like when Fulham scored a great headed goal at Aston Villa. Even though it wasn’t disallowed, there was still a wait while it was assessed and that markedly reduces what should have been a great moment. It almost feels like you’ve got to ask if you’re allowed to score. Why do we even allow this intrusion? The rest of football gets by without it; why do the top leagues have to endure a patently flawed system?",
      "It’s put perversion at the game’s core, not fairness. In fact it has clearly made the game less fair. As we typically saw at Brentford, it took three minutes to decide Nathan Collins had not stopped a goalscoring opportunity by pulling Bryan Mbeumo eight yards from goal but nonetheless that it was enough for a penalty yet not enough to qualify as a goalscoring opportunity, so it wasn’t a red card, even though it was a goalscoring opportunity. If that doesn’t illustrate the pathetic nonsense of the system to you, nothing will.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, not the most emotionally stable player at the best of times, was left to think about the enormity of the task ahead. The weight of the occasion was ignored, Fernandes was broken on the back of ‘getting it right’.",
      "MAILBOX: Amorim is done, Bruno was ‘awful’ and Man Utd are ‘trash’ but what about the ‘two VAR shockers’?",
      "A system designed to help officials has made them palpably worse. Of course it has. They actually look smaller, neutered and pathetic. A weedy Walter on a field of Dennis the Menaces.",
      "I actually feel sorrow for them through my rage. What are they even for now? It looks like they don’t even know. If the guidance is to go with the on-field decision where possible, that doesn’t happen because ‘going with the on-field decision’ means the referee’s performance is being judged in real time, which in turn makes them paranoid they’ll get something wrong, which means they will, which will then make VAR intervene. On Saturday they took five minutes to decide the referee was right in the first place.",
      "It was said that it would fix blatant mistakes, but Sunderland were awarded a dubious free-kick which led to a goal (after the inevitable scrutiny for a miniscule offside). Forest have every reason to think that free-kick should not have been allowed. VAR failed to legitimise contentious decisions and left everyone feeling cheated. Exactly the opposite of what is supposed to happen.",
      "Time and again they won’t rule on things that happen in a phase before a goal but will rule on the goal, thus compounding their inadequacy. Get a free-kick unfairly but when that leads to a goal, it is ruled offside by a knee. Everyone hates it. Dissatisfaction is absolute.",
      "Decisions to correct mistakes are declared to be out of the remit of VAR, as if one phase of football can be divorced from the next. Yet things in their remit are called wrongly or take forever or are against the spirit of the game. And what is handball now? It used to be simple. But now they can’t decide and unfair decisions are made all the time. People have got so used to the confusion that have even stopped questioning it.",
      "That explosion of emotion when a goal is scored has been ruined, the groan of despair has replaced it. And people thought this was a good idea. Every round of games is dominated by terrible VAR and refereeing decisions. The overall standard has obviously dropped with the introduction of VAR. The stats will tell you more decisions are called right, but that’s only because they’ve defined what is correct. The offside knee decision can be called correct but it’s a bad decision.",
      "We’ve lost the soul and heart of football and turned it into a fussy, pathetic and often just as incorrect sport. At Brentford we saw how their actions can affect the result. VAR is altering the table, it’s become that pernicious. And as we see sweating referees wandering the pitch waiting to be told in his ear what to do as the players cool down and risk tearing a muscle, is there a more heinous, tragic and impotent sight in football?",
      "There was nothing wrong with football when various idiots insisted it be introduced. Unquestioningly it’s made the game worse but the money in football is almost entirely from TV and they bloody love it. Football as content provider rather than sport is the new normal. Stay tuned for more of the same coming right up after the break.",
      "While Man Utd are this bad, they can’t afford a goalkeeper to be letting in more than he should. Ruben Amorim needs a stopper like Sunderland’s…",
      "Arsenal fans are buoyant after that win over the anti-football folk of Newcastle United, but Gabriel does deserve a slap.",
      "Surely there is nobody – not even Ruben Amorim – who thinks that Ruben Amorim should not be sacked by Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United will be weighing up the ‘eye-watering’ severance fee due to Ruben Amorim, but it wouldn’t even be in the top ten biggest manager pay-offs.",
      "Obviously it’s ridiculously early to be talking about a Premier League team of the season so far, but it’s also bloody good fun.",
      "There is reported ‘optimism’ in the Saudi Pro League that Bruno Fernandes will be signed, and ‘stubborn’ Ruben Amorim could push him out of Manchester United."

      "No. He’s rubbish. 17 losses in 33 games. Get him gone. There’s literally no more words left to say on him, and every defence is full of obvious holes. Just like the one he sets up.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "I had largely fallen out of love with football but the decision of my 10-year-old son to start supporting Man Utd has dragged me back in. Suffice it to say, it has been miserable watching him suffer. All he has known is this dross.",
      "What is striking is how, no matter what Utd try, they fail. They have tried a Fergie mould (Moyes), a legend of the game (Van Gaal), the winning bastard (Mourinho), the good vibes guy (Solskjaer), methodical tacticians (Rangnick and Ten Hag) and now young hotshot (Amorim). And they’ve also thrown literal billions of pounds at it. But nothing seems to work.",
      "It is, of course, reminiscent of Liverpool’s fall from grace in the 90s and their long years in the wilderness. It’s not quite the same and less money was involved but still the parallel is reasonable. No matter what Liverpool tried it just didn’t seem to work. More than that they seemed “unlucky”. How else to explain Gerrard’s slip in 2015 that ended up giving away the one decent chance they’d had at the title in 25 years? The poor man had only delivered a rousing speech to his teammates admonishing them specifically not to let their title lead slip. He meant it figuratively but the universe took it literally and threw him on his arse. It was sheer banter just like it is now with Utd. No matter who they buy, no matter how well they play (it happens occasionally), they still fall on their arse. They seem, as it were, “cursed”.",
      "For Liverpool, though, that curse was lifted and I think often about how that happened.",
      "There was, of course, Fenway taking over and introducing sabermetrics that resulted in a wonderful recruitment programme. A well-run club is no doubt important but that does not lift curses. For that you need a shaman. And so, Liverpool hired one.",
      "Jurgen Klopp was the most remarkable football figure I had ever seen. Tall, loud, a grin like a madman, an exuberance like a bear high on honey, he dominated every room or stadium he walked into. I realise now that when he famously forced the Liverpool team to salute the fans after a miserable draw against West Brom early in his tenure he was actually performing an exorcism. He was grabbing the club by the scruff of the neck and shaking out all the trauma, all the scars and all the suffering so they could start again. He transfused belief into the players and the fans through sheer personality. While other managers were devising gameplans he was performing rituals. The success came later but that West Brom game was when the magic started.",
      "And that now is what Man Utd need. They don’t need a tactician or an organiser. They need a shaman like Klopp. They need a talismanic figure who can root out the negativity that has infected the club to its core and instil in everyone the belief needed to grow and return to success. They need someone who can perform spiritual surgery on their very soul.",
      "Unfortunately, these people are in short supply. You don’t learn this stuff on your UEFA Pro Licence course and Klopp himself is out of the question even though he’s exactly what Utd need. My head tells me Glasner should be appointed when Amorim is given the boot but another name draws my attention.",
      "Gareth Southgate is not Klopp. He is as uninspiring a prospect now as he was when he somehow got the England job. And yet, he did work out (sort of). England got to two major finals and a World cup semi. He did something right even though that something didn’t appear to be tactical or organisational. Rather, he helped move England past something. They won a knockout penalty shootout. More than that, the players seemed…happy? They played with a freedom and verve, liberated seemingly from the psychological dungeon the national team had been locked in for several decades themselves. He even seemed “lucky”, with England apparently receiving favourable draws in tournaments.",
      "In other words, despite not having anything like Klopp’s charisma or presence, Southgate dragged his team out of a psychological hole – a bigger one perhaps even than that inhabited by either Liverpool or Man Utd.",
      "So, maybe, just maybe, despite every indication to the contrary, Southgate is exactly what Utd need right now.",

      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",

But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",

It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",

Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "Iraola would be a better fit for Man Utd than Glasner, though that is mainly because the Crystal Palace boss doesn’t suit the Red Devils at all.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, Glasner is a brilliant manager and he is working wonders at Crystal Palace.

      "Man Utd would be daft to go for Glasner and continue with a system that’s proven not to work at Old Trafford and this is why a repeat of the Amorim mistake won’t happen, with the Crystal Palace boss only linked because he’s doing good work at another Premier League club and not that there’s any credible interest.",

      "And his role at United could potentially see him look to the exit, as though he’s having some success in a deeper role than he’s used to – owing to Amorim’s system playing No.10s like wingers and therefore shoving Fernandes further back – he could be playing far better.",

But Amorim is too stubborn to change.’",

Massive stoppage, Bruno made to wait half an hour and then Brentford were allowed to delay the kick longer by making substitutions. You just knew he would miss after that.",
      "Either way, we didn’t create enough and were too weak in defence; particularly in the first 20 mins. Maguire stepping up to play offside was akin to a tectonic plate moving.

He did pop up in lots of places but I am not sure it really suited anyone else in the team. We looked so disjointed and were maybe guilty of overthinking the set up for this game. Gakpo and moving back to a 4-3-3 instantly made us look more balanced and dangerous.",

Poor penalty Fernandes, who has shown he can be affected by delays.’",

      "Thiago is a big lad, and there’s no great shame in losing an aerial battle to him, but there absolutely is in allowing him to chest the ball down to a teammate under no pressure from a ball punted from at least 60 yards. It was pathetic from Mattihjs de Ligt, as was his failure to then track Thiago into the box as he tapped the ball in to double Brentford’s lead.",
      "His United teammates could have helped him out of a bind, but didn’t, with Manuel Ugarte, Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw the firefighters with their d*cks in their hands.",
      "And in a clear example of the fragile confidence at United, after a very solid start to the season, certainly compared to last, De Ligt crumbled, misplacing passes, misjudging the flight of the ball and conceding needless free-kicks. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he air kicked and fell over in his own box.",
      "We didn’t see any great uptick in forward fluency as United’s £200m forward trio started together for the first time. Link-up between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha ended with either a poor final pass or a timid effort from one or the other until Cunha’s cross for Mbeumo led to the United penalty. And while Peter Crouch claimed Benjamin Sesko’s goal was an example of his “commitment”, it is undeniably funny that he needed three shots to score from inside the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United may well have had the most shots (79), created the most chances (60) and accrued the most expected goals (9.7) in the Premier League after the first five games, but it never really felt as though the Brentford goal was under any great pressure.",
      "Amorim was proved right in sticking with Bayindir, who made another brilliant save to deny Dango Ouattara and keep his side in the game midway through the second half, but the space Outtara found himself in on the penalty spot begs the question as to why he continues to pick Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could be just as late in tracking back as the Uruguayan in such a situation, but also probably wouldn’t be, and wouldn’t either give the ball away or play a pass sideways or backwards whenever he has possession.",
      "And as predicted when the team news was announced, Amorim will face some difficult questions as to why he’s dropped Leny Yoro for the last two games after what looked to be a very assured start to the season. Both his speed and ability to progress the ball would have very useful here, and surely an improvement on what any of Maguire, De Ligt or Shaw provided.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Bayindir immediately proves Crouch right after ‘three No.2s’ Man Utd claim\n👉 Amorim set for pelters if Man Utd lose to Brentford thanks to three uninspiring selections\n👉 Amorim leads sack race with Emery after West Ham bin Graham Potter",
      "We thoroughly look forward to the PGMOL apology to Manchester United for somehow failing to advise Craig Pawson to even look at the pitch-side monitor as Nathan Collins denied Mbeumo one of the clearest goalscoring opportunities imaginable, particularly as the time it took to make that wrong decision contributed to an interminable wait for Bruno Fernandes to take the penalty which he then missed, as some excellent substitution sh*thousery from Keith Andrews made it a five-minute delay.",
      "United still had 15 minutes including stoppage time to draw level against a side which has dropped more points (8) from winning positions than any other team in the Premier League this season, but it was Brentford who added to their lead, with substitute Mathias Jensen combining with Yehor Yarmolyuk on the break before smashing the ball past Bayindir.",
      "Joe Cole described Manchester United as “abysmal” after the final whistle, but refused to pin the blame on Amorim, instead claiming it’s the old “culture of the club” problem rearing its head again.",
      "But f*** that. This is on Amorim. He picked the wrong team, his formation and tactics don’t work, and his players crumble at the merest hint of a hardship. If this isn’t the worst team in Manchester United history, it’s surely the easiest to play against. The best the fans can hope for is more false dawns under a manager not fit for purpose.",
      "Pundit Alan Shearer has revealed why he thinks Ruben Amorim hasn’t been sacked by Manchester United, with his axe to be a “terrible look” for INEOS.",
      "Club legend Wayne Rooney has revealed his clear verdict on Ruben Amorim and INEOS, insisting there is “no soul” at Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has hit out at Ruben Amorim over an “unforgivable” decision and has commented on the head coach’s future.",
      "Surely there is nobody – not even Ruben Amorim – who thinks that Ruben Amorim should not be sacked by Manchester United.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "With sacked Nuno Espirito Santo ‘expected’ to replace sacked Graham Potter, we can only assume that Potter will replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd."

      "Monday 29 September 2025 10:23, UK",

      "INCIDENT: The decision was made not to send off Collins after he conceded a penalty. VAR checked the yellow card shown to Collins after a penalty was given, but they agreed with the referee's decision with Bryan Mbuemo deemed to be not in control of the ball.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Nathan got really, really lucky. The VAR would have looked at it and decided Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.",
      "\"Nathan panics. He pulls his shirt and if he doesn't do that, Mbeumo, who got a touch to the ball, would have got it. He's got a clear goalscoring opportunity eight yards out.",
      "\"They looked at it, looked at it and looked at it. I have a theory that your gut takes over. You look at a replay and you make up your mind. The more you look at it, the more you doubt yourself.\"",
      "Jay Bothroyd on Ref Watch: \"It baffles me. Mbeumo is not in control of the ball because he's not going to control it.",
      "\"He's going to hit that first time. The pace is on the cross and all he is going to do is redirect the ball towards the corner.",
      "\"He's not going to control that in a million years.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR Darren England intervenes after referee Jarred Gillett awarded a penalty to Arsenal after Nick Pope appeared to foul Viktor Gyokeres. The referee changed his mind after looking at the screen and overturned the decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It shows how difficult it was with Gary Neville going from being adamant it was a penalty to being torn when he sees it again.",
      "\"Pope does get a touch on the ball. My immediate instinct was penalty... but Pope does plant his foot so he doesn't follow through with the tackle so that's why it was overturned.",
      "\"This year, they've tried to stick with the on-field decision as much as possible, but once the VAR looks at it, he's decided that Pope has played the ball - that's the key factor.",
      "\"He's sent the referee to the screen but he can still hold his ground. He can still say it's a penalty. Referees take everything into consideration - where the ball is going, the direction of play, would the player have got it?\"",
      "On the similarities with the Robert Sanchez incident from the previous weekend: \"It was different. He touches the ball and follows through with the tackle... with the Pope one, he touches the ball but he plants his foot and does no more.",
      "\"Pope does not go into Gyokeres. He's stopping.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Newcastle's appeals for a penalty for handball against Gabriel were turned down by Gillett. VAR checked the incident but stuck with the on-field decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"This is a really interesting decision.",
      "\"The rule is that if the ball strikes your body and flies up onto your arm, it's not going to be given because it is not possible to get out of the way.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gabriel also escaped punishment after a clash with Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade.",

      "\"The referee has seen something has happened and what he does well is he calms them down and takes the sting out of the incident.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Trevoh Chalobah was sent off after a VAR review for the denying of a goalscoring opportunity with a foul on Diego Gomez.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I wonder whether Simon Hooper initially thought he caught him with his shoulder, but he's definitely tripped him.",
      "\"Gomez got across the defender and he's in the ascendancy. Once he's got there, the defender clips him and it's a red card.\"",

      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I honestly don't know about this one. I usually have a gut reaction when I look at a replay and then I make up my mind.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job. The momentum of victory over Chelsea vanished when his side were beaten at Brentford for a third time in four visits",
      "Sunday 28 September 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",
      "Amorim has been in the job for 10 months and is yet to win consecutive games in the league. Momentum feels extremely distant right now."

      "Bruno Fernandes had a penalty saved as Manchester United fell to a 3-1 defeat at Brentford to put the spotlight back on Ruben Amorim as his search for back-to-back league wins continues.",
      "United were 2-1 down as Fernandes waited more than four minutes to take his second-half spot-kick which was eventually saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after VAR checked if Nathan Collins should have been sent off for denying Bryan Mbeumo a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson's decision to book Collins was upheld, without him being sent to the monitor, despite the Brentford defender making no clear attempt to play the ball when pulling his former team-mate back by the shoulder.",
      "Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.\n\n\nIn all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.",
      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",
      "Fernandes' second failure from the spot this season ultimately cost United, who are now winless in their last eight away league games and back in the bottom half as Brentford climb above them thanks to a richly deserved three points.",
      "Brentford Kelleher (7), Kayode (8), Collins (7) Van den Berg (7), Hickey (7), Henderson (8), Yarmoliuk (8), Ouattara (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (8), Thiago (9). \n\n\nSubs: Lewis-Potter (6), Henry (6), Onyeka (6), Janelt (6), Jensen (7).\n\n\nMan Utd: Bayindir (6), De Ligt (5), Maguire (5), Shaw (5), Dalot (4), Ugarte (5), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (5),  Mbeumo (5), Sesko (6), Cunha (5).\n\n\nSubs:  Mainoo (6), Yoro (5), Mount (5), ZIrkzee (5).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Igor Thiago.",
      "Amorim disagreed with the decision not to send off Collins but said his team should have done more to manage the game after Fernandes failed to convert his penalty.",
      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",
      "Asked if he felt it was an area to target, Andrews said: \"It's the natural way you prepare for games. You try and create overloads. One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in then they have a four.",
      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
