      "Jack Butland played second fiddle to David de Gea during his six months at Man Utd(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Jack Butland could be a title-winner at the end of the season after quitting the Premier League. Butland spent the second half of the 2022/23 campaign at Old Trafford on loan from Crystal Palace, where he had fallen out of favour.",
      "Although he was part of the squad that won the 2023 FA Cup, he didn't make a single appearance, with the long-serving David de Gea keeping his place before being let go at the end of the season. Then-manager Erik ten Hag brought in Andre Onana from Inter Milan, which proved to be an expensive mistake.",
      "Desperate for first-team football, Butland joined Rangers permanently that summer following the expiry of his Palace contract, but there are some who felt he should have been given a chance to establish himself at United.",
      "They included former Rangers player John Brown, who insisted Butland was at least on a par with United's first-choice stoppers at the time. Speaking in 2024, Brown, who played for the Gers between 1988 and 1997, said: \"I was always a fan of Butland. I was surprised he never got more minutes down south.",

      "\"When I look at the Premier League, there are a lot of goalkeepers down there that I'd say Jack Butland is better than. He was at Manchester United and for me their first-choice goalkeeper... If I was going for a steady keeper, then Jack Butland would be my choice.\"",
      "Brown also backed Butland, 32, to play into his 40s, adding: \"He probably has another 10 years at the top because of the years he's missed.\"",
      "Explaining why he had to quit English football, Butland said via The Scotsman: \"As much as I enjoyed Palace and as good as United was, I missed playing. And that's important to me.",

      "\"All right, 'Could you be at United?' Well, yes, but what would the rest of my career look like? That was important to me. I wanted 30 onwards to be something l look back on as a successful period and not one that drifted away.\"",
      "While Butland has helped Rangers storm into Scottish Premiership title contention under Danny Rohl, who replaced the deeply unpopular Russell Martin in October, he has made the occasional error.",
      "During the recent 5-1 win over Kilmarnock, he gifted the visitors their goal with an errant clearance that went straight to goalscorer Greg Kiltie. Butland is contracted to Rangers, who host leaders Hearts in a huge title showdown on Sunday, until the summer of 2027.",
      "United, meanwhile, appear to have resolved their problem in between the sticks. Senne Lammens has been a reassuring presence since his £18million arrival last summer, with Onana now on loan at Trabzonspor.",

      "He has netted 10 goals and contributed 13 assists in all competitions, with Barca currently topping La Liga, just one point ahead of Real Madrid.

      "Deco lauded Rashford's decision to take a significant pay cut from his reported £325,000-a-week wages to secure a move to Barcelona. He stated: \"We were able to secure a loan.

      "John Barnes gave his viewpoint on the immigration debate(Image: X/GMB)",
      "Former England international footballer John Barnes says he has no problem with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's immigration comments. Ratcliffe, the Manchester United part-owner, suggested this week that the United Kingdom had been \"colonised\" by immigrants, and while Barnes isn't happy with the use of that word, he welcomed debate.",
      "United fan organisations and politicians from a variety of parties have shared their own reactions to the billionaire's statements, while the Premier League club released a statement on Thursday. Barnes, who was born in Jamaica and relocated to England during his childhood, believes Ratcliffe is entitled to raise the topic, but took issue with Nigel Farage after the Reform UK leader's response.",
      "\"I have no issue with Jim Ratcliffe. I have no issue with his debate on immigration, that's a valid debate to be had,\" Barnes said on Good Morning Britain. \"Of course, immigration brings lots of good, and of course when he talks about illegal immigration, that has to be addressed... I agree with him on that.",
      "\"The only thing I have an issue with was the word 'colonised'. That is the only thing about this whole debate, because we have to have meaningful discussion on immigration, as to whether it's good or it's bad.\"",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "During the Sky News interview in which he made the comments, Ratcliffe cited innacurate statistics on immigration numbers and also said he considered Farage to be an \"intelligent man.\" Farage subsequently said he thought Ratcliffe was correct but Barnes has challenged the Reform UK leader's position.",
      "“Now, the ‘colonised’ bit is the thing that I have an issue with, because of course by no stretch of the imagination can we interpret what’s happening with immigration as colonisation,\" the former Liverpool star continued. \"Colonisation is when a settler community from a different country comes to our country and dominates and exploits economically and politically and controls the system.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe caused controversy with his comments about immigration(Image: Getty)",
      "He added: \"I agree with [Ratcliffe] on some points about immigration and we can have that discussion but as far as the colonisation part goes, that is completely wrong. For Nigel Farage to come and say... that by the interpretation in the dictionary he agrees with him about England being colonised or Great Britain being colonised: No.",
      "\"The interpretation in the dictionary, the meaning in the dictionary, actually states that it's the domination, exploitation and control of an indigenous population by foreign entities, which is not happening here.\"",
      "Ratcliffe responded on Thursday with a statement following the backlash from his initial interview. Politicians including Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham have criticised the billionaire, who could now face FA punishment after an investigation was launched.",
      "Nigel Farage has spoken about Ratcliffe's comments(Image: Christopher Furlong, Getty Images)",

      "Ratcliffe, 73, one of the UK's richest men, expressed his admiration for Nigel Farage and claimed the country was being \"colonised\" by immigrants in a shocking interview released this week that has seen him branded \"hypocritical\".",
      "The Sunday Times Rich List estimated he's worth a massive £17billion, and, alongside his part ownership of the Premier League club, he has mansions in London and Hampshire, and a £78million superyacht.",
      "But despite being financially stacked, the founder of chemical firm INEOS has gone to great lengths to hoard his wealth, including moving countries so he can pay less in tax.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been lambasted for his words(Image: Catherine Ivill - AMA, Getty Images)",
      "Mr Ratcliffe claimed this week that the UK \"can’t afford\" immigration and benefits, adding during an interview with Sky News: \"You can’t have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.\"",
      "He also suggested: \"The UK is being colonised by immigrants, really, isn’t it?” Ratcliffe, from Failsworth in Oldham, Manchester, trained as a chemical engineer and founded the INEOS chemicals group, now a multinational conglomerate, in 1998.",
      "In 2020, two years after he was knighted for \"services to business and investment\" he officially changed his tax residence, switching from Hampshire to Monaco.",
      "Monaco is a sovereign city state tax haven outside France where authorities do not levy taxes on income, wealth or property, and the deicision, at the time, was believed to have allowed Ratcliffe up to save up to £4 billion if he stayed there more than 183 days a year.",
      "He was previously one of the UK's biggest taxpayers, having contributed an estimated £110 million to the public purse between 2017 and 2018, placing him atop the Sunday Times Rich lists and fifth on the publication's Tax List. Ratcliffe doesn't appear on the tax list at all in 2026, but ranked seventh on the most recent Rich List, released in 2025.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe also controls Scotland's largest industrial site(Image: Getty Images)",
      "His continued presence on the list while suggesting the UK can't financially support people coming to the country has led people to accuse him of being a hypocrite.",
      "Among them was Sage Coulter, 30, a Manchester United fan of 13 years hailing from Florida who said his comments were \"inappropriate\" and \"hypocritical\". She told the BBC: \"It's sad to see that that is happening over here,\" Sage said. \"Immigrants are important.",
      "\"[Ratcliffe] lives in Monaco and doesn't pay UK taxes, so I mean, it's a bit ironic and hypocritical. It's all very hypocritical. How many immigrants play for United and other clubs?\"",
      "Manchester United would have been left with just three players on its starting lineup and two on its bench without its immigrant players, and the team said in a rare statement following Mr Ratcliffe's comments that it treasured its \"diverse group of players, staff, and global community of supporters\".",

      "Real Madrid superstar Bellingham suffered a hamstring injury last month and some reports in Spain have suggested the England midfielder could be out until April. But Tuchel says he has been in regular touch and is hoping Bellingham could be fit to face Uruguay and Japan in England’s last two friendlies before they jet to the World Cup this summer.",
      "England boss Tuchel also confirmed that he is ready to welcome Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw back to the fold as they are back in United’s starting line-up under interim boss Michael Carrick.",

      "“Of course we are in contact, that is a normal thing to do, and we wish him all the best. Whatever we can do for him, we will help and support him. It is a little race against time. Personally, I am optimistic, but I am not sure.”",
      "Tuchel was at West Ham on Tuesday night and was positive on all three potentially being backed for March - and the World Cup.",
      "All three fell off the England radar after losing their places in the United set-up but Tuchel was glowing about Mainoo and was also positive about the two defenders.",

      "Marcus Rashford is thriving at Barcelona(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Barcelona sporting director Deco has praised Marcus Rashford for thriving after the \"enormous demands\" he played under at Manchester United. And the club icon has also revealed on-loan Rashford was close to joining another club last summer.",
      "Rashford, 28, made the move to Catalonia after falling out of Ruben Amorim's graces back at Old Trafford. He spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa before Barca raised interest in his services.",
      "And it's emerged just how invested Villa were in keeping the England international. However, according to Deco, Rashford only had eyes for one move once the prospect presented itself.",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" the Barcelona legend told Sport when asked if he and the rest of the board are pleased with Rashford's progress. \"I think it wasn't easy to come here. He has played at a very high level, with enormous demands at a club like Manchester United.",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "\"Then he spent six months at Aston Villa, where he did a very good job. In fact, Aston Villa, they would have kept him if it had been possible. I know this because I've spoken to people there.",
      "\"But he only wanted to come to Barca, and that's a very positive thing. We were able to secure a loan. The fact that he took a pay cut to make it happen is a clear demonstration that he really wanted to come, and we're very happy about that. He's a player who contributes a lot to the team.\"",
      "Deco, 48, is right in that the salary sacrifice was a vital contribution to get Rashford's Barcelona loan over the line. The Spanish powerhouse's finances wouldn't allow them to sign him on his previous £300,000 a week terms at United, and he agreed to reduce his fee to £225,000 a week to make the move happen.",
      "Deco, who has served as Barcelona sporting director for almost three years, is a big fan of Rashford(Image: David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)",
      "The Portuguese mastermind is also correct in asserting how that action made clear just how eager Rashford was to join. And it's showed in his performances thus far at the Camp Nou, where he has scored 10 goals and assisted another 13 in 34 outings.",
      "It stands to reason that Rashford is reportedly intent on converting the loan move into a permanent one at the end of this season. Hansi Flick has spoken positively about his loanee, who has a £26million purchase clause in his agreement.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "However, not even that may be low enough for Barca to take the plunge. That's following reports suggesting the Catalans have asked United if they can pay a smaller sum to convert Rashford into a permanent signing.",
      "That may not gel with United's vision, particularly given recent speculation suggesting interim manager Michael Carrick wants him back at Old Trafford. However, all signs hint that convincing Rashford himself may be the most difficult hurdle.",

      "Manchester United chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe apologised for claiming the UK was \"colonised by immigrants\" as anti-racism groups said that he had taken \"the battering he deserved\". Ratcliffe's shameful remarks were condemned by the Prime Minister, Man United fans and residents of the council estate where he spent the early years of his childhood. The FA was understood to be examining whether his comments to Sky News had brought the game into disrepute.",
      "Ratcliffe, 73, who has a £17billion fortune, said: \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe Man Utd part owner(Image: PA)",
      "\"My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.",
      "\"My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK.\"",
      "In the original interview, he had said: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. The UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?",
      "\"The population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"",
      "Ged Grebby of Show Racism the Red Card said the apology from the Man Utd owner was 'not enough'(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)",
      "In fact, it had only grown by 2.7m. Ged Grebby, chief executive of Show Racism the Red Card, said the tycoon had ignored the benefits of immigration and was not really apologising at all. \"I think he has taken the battering he deserved,\" he said.",
      "\"He has said that he is sorry if he offended some people and that is not really an apology and also does not address the main issue - that he said that the UK had been colonised by immigration.",
      "\"It implies a takeover of the UK in language used by the Far Right. It is that he needs to apologise for. We welcome people saying sorry, it is all about rehabilitation; but this is not a proper apology. He has not addressed the problems he has created for Manchester Utd football club.\"",
      "His influence \"should be used to challenge racism, not inadvertently amplify narratives that undermine community harmony\", he added, while Kick It Out said the comments were \"disgraceful and deeply divisive\".",
      "Meanwhile residents on Dunkerley Avenue in Failsworth, Greater Manchester - the modest street where Sir Jim lived until he was 10 - were also critical of his views. Rob Cosgrove, 62, lives just a couple of doors down from Sir Jim's former home.",
      "Rob Cosgrove lives in the street with Ratcliffe spent his early years(Image: William Lailey / SWNS)",
      "He said: \"I disagree with him. Immigrants make a country. You could argue countries like America have been built on immigrants.",
      "\"People bring their cultures, habits and customs - and it makes the country richer. He's betraying his roots. I can't understand how someone who grew up in Failsworth can have views like that.\"",
      "Sir Jim, now one of Britain's richest men, lived there before building chemicals giant INEOS and buying a stake in Manchester United. Mr Cosgrove said the comments jar: \"It's inflammatory and it's certainly not doing any good at the moment. It's a bit rich when he's living in Monaco to avoid paying tax in the country. I think he's out of order for saying that.\"",
      "He added: \"It's damaging for Failsworth. People shouldn't get the idea that Failsworth is a hotbed for the right wing. It's good to see that the United fan groups have condemned his remarks.\"",
      "Responding to his comments about welfare, another resident added: \"People's situations have become very difficult and they've been forced to go on benefits, they're just trying to survive.\"",
      "The street where Ratcliffe lived as a child in Manchester(Image: William Lailey / SWNS)",
      "Others agreed with Sir Jim's views. But Mr Starmer’s spokesman said it was right that he apologised. They told reporters: “The Prime Minister asked for an apology, and one’s been issued, and it’s absolutely right that Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for that language. “The Prime Minister was clear that those comments were offensive and wrong, and that’s why he called on Mr Ratcliffe to apologise. We are of course of the view that there should be a serious debate about immigration, but the Prime Minister believes in a Britain built for all, and that those comments were inflammatory and divisive.”",
      "Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, branded the migration rant \"inaccurate, insulting, inflammatory\" and against everything the city stands for. In a scathing statement, Mr Burnham said: “Calling for curbs on levels of immigration is one thing; portraying those who come here as a hostile invading force is quite another.",
      "“Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city-region, as have the many people working in Greater Manchester's NHS and other essential services and industries. If any criticism is needed, it should be directed towards those who have offered little contribution to our life here and have instead spent years siphoning wealth out of one of our proudest institutions.\"",
      "The billionaire is ranked the seventh wealthiest person in Britain in the Sunday Times's rich list, with a £17billion fortune. Justice minister Jake Richards branded the language \"offensive\", and told Times Radio that Ratcliffe didn't even live in the UK.",
      "He added: “Let’s be very clear that Jim Ratcliffe’s comments were both offensive in terms of the language used, and he got his facts wrong. There’s also something that I find quite offensive, that this man who moved to Monaco to save £4 billion in tax is now lecturing us about immigration. There’s something that I find slightly hypocritical about that.”",
      "Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club warned Ratcliffe had echoed language 'frequently used in far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats\".",
      "Its co-founder and club secretary Asif Mahmud said: \"We are very upset. There was quite a bit of shock in our membership base. They are not the comments you expect from the co-owner of Man Utd.",
      "\"Colonisation has a lot of strong meanings. It is not the right word. We appreciate there are legitimate debates around immigration and illegal immigration. But using words like that just stokes the flames.",
      "\"That word is used by the far right. We did not expect it from the co-owner of Manchester United.\"",
      "The club's Supporters Trust added: \"No fan should feel excluded from following or supporting the club because of their race, religion, nationality or background. Comments from the club's senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder.",
      "\"This is not about politics; it is about ensuring that the custodians of Manchester United act in a way that unites supporters rather than marginalising any part of our fanbase.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag's decision to approve McTominay's sale in 2024 has become increasingly questionable over time. United have frequently been short of the energy and determination he would have brought to midfield.",
      "The position has now become a key area of focus ahead of the summer transfer window, irrespective of who becomes the next permanent manager. Michael Carrick has emerged as a contender by delivering an impressive stint as interim boss so far.",
      "That hasn't escaped McTominay's attention, who has expressed his tremendous respect for Carrick and his delight at witnessing United's resurgence. The two are former Old Trafford team-mates, while Carrick has also previously coached McTominay.",

      "Nevertheless, Strachan has cautioned his compatriot against returning to his boyhood club, even if Carrick is in charge. He reckons the existing system, with Fernandes playing as a number 10, wouldn't be suitable for McTominay.",
      "Strachan told BetVictor Casino: \"I don't think Scott McTominay should retrace his steps. I think he has to go into a system that allows him to be the midfield player who gets into the box without too many touches.",
      "\"I think that's what he fell upon at Napoli, a system that suits him to be free to just get in the box. Would Manchester United play like that? Because you've got Bruno Fernandes playing as a number 10 now.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been playing higher up the pitch under Michael Carrick(Image: Michael Regan, Getty Images)",
      "\"They've got to have the other players who are more set to a certain extent. Does he like going back there, McTominay, taking the ball from the back four and playing from there?",
      "\"Or does he prefer being 30 yards further up the pitch, waiting for crosses, doing edge-of-the-box stuff? It's got to be a system that suits him. I don't know whether he thinks it would be the nicest place to play, to be honest with you.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",

      "McTominay has been superb for Napoli(Image: SSC NAPOLI via Getty Images)",
      "\"There was a glimpse of McTominay at Man United in certain games. He's not the trickiest player on the ball, he hasn't got the greatest vision in the world, but for somebody attacking the box and getting goals and strength in the middle of the park, then he's your man.\"",
      "If McTominay shares those concerns, they could be eased if Fernandes decides to depart this summer. There are rumours that the Portuguese playmaker has become weary of the constant turmoil at Old Trafford and is prepared for a new challenge.

      "Avram Glazer and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.(Image: 2024 Chris Brunskill/Fantasista)",
      "Just when the mood had lifted at Manchester United, Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave an interview that prompted the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to demand an apology from him.",
      "The communications team at United must have winced when they first read the quotes. Ratcliffe said the United Kingdom has been \"colonised by immigrants\" and his comments drew backlash.",
      "Ratcliffe issued a statement to say he was sorry his choice of language had offended some people, but added that it was \"important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration\".",

      "This is not an article to get into the politics, however, it is an examination of Ratcliffe's reputation in Manchester, and how he is viewed by the fans of the club he grew up supporting.",
      "Many have disagreed with Ratcliffe. Carly Lyes, chair of the MUFC Local Supporters' Club, an official branch for fans who live within a two-mile radius of Old Trafford, said his comments were a \"slap in the face.\"",
      "The co-founder of the Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club (MUMSC), Ghulam Haydar, said he was \"appalled\" by Ratcliffe's comments and questioned whether Muslims are welcome at the club.",
      "The 1958 protest group described Ratcliffe as a \"total embarrassment, whether in front of a camera or being interviewed.\" The Manchester United Supporters' Trust have reiterated the club belongs to everyone.",
      "United released an official statement, which did not directly refer to Ratcliffe, to distance themselves from the comments, saying the club \"prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming\" and that they will \"continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\"",
      "Michael Carrick will be thankful for the 13-day gap between games for United, but he will inevitably face questions about Ratcliffe when he speaks at his press conference next week.",
      "A billboard outside Old Trafford.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Although the news cycle moves quickly in football, this feels like something that won't simply blow over. In the eyes of angry fans, Ratcliffe has caused further damage to an already poor reputation.",
      "The damage could be permanent. Some won't change their opinion about Ratcliffe, regardless of whether United are successful on the pitch in the coming years.",
      "The erosion of Ratcliffe's reputation has happened gradually since he acquired a minority stake in February 2024. There has been a catalogue of bad decisions committed by the 73-year-old.",
      "The Ineos regime's first big decision ahead of Ratcliffe's first full season as co-owner was to address Erik ten Hag's future. The Dutchman's contract was extended when overwhelming evidence indicated he should have been sacked.",
      "After the Dutchman departed, Ruud van Nistelrooy took over on an interim basis before Ruben Amorim was appointed. United paid around £11million to release him from his contract at Sporting, but Amorim lasted just 14 months in charge and received a £10m compensation package when he was axed.",
      "Dan Ashworth departed shortly after Amorim's appointment. It was said there were \"too many cooks in the kitchen (boardroom)\", and there was an internal clash over Ten Hag's successor. United paid a combined £14.5m to sack Ten Hag, his backroom staff and Ashworth.",
      "Ratcliffe, Berrada and Wilcox.(Image: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)",
      "Off the pitch, Ratcliffe needed to lower the employee count, which was the highest in the Premier League, but the extent of the redundancies was brutal. That was the start of an assault on the club's identity: ticket prices have soared, and the penny pinching has known no bounds.",
      "Ratcliffe axed the annual £40,000 donation to the Association of Former Manchester United Players, which was set up in 1985 to support its 300-plus members, who represented the club in the years before huge wages. Gary Neville sat down with Ratcliffe last year and grilled him on the issue.",
      "He said: \"That’s not the players that played under Sir Alex, or even the last 10 years. They’re players from the 60s and 70s. Why not raise the money at a dinner? Give the ex-players their money. It’s a cruel decision.”",
      "Ratcliffe responded \"nobody has suggested that because I would have supported that\", in a comical scene that wouldn't have looked out of place in the political satire British television series 'The Thick of It'.",
      "United fans protested against the ownership of the club before the Fulham game at the start of the month. Ratcliffe was a target, just a few years after the same protestors had welcomed his investment.",
      "Last year, Ratcliffe said he would walk away from United if he got \"abused\" in the same way the Glazer family have. His reputation among fans has sunk as low as the Glazers'.",

      "Mason Mount pictured in the stands during a spell out injured with Manchester United(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are unrecognisable from the team which Ruben Amorim left following a 1-1 draw at Leeds last month. Since Michael Carrick's return, the formation has changed, the style of football has become more exciting and players are being used in positions which suit their strengths.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is an example of that. United's captain and talisman was less effective playing in the deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro but now has more freedom to impact matches further up the pitch as a No.10. Patrick Dorgu, prior to his injury, became a revelation on the left wing having struggled at wing-back under Amorim.",
      "United are a different beast these days and while on the surface it seems like everyone is a winner, there is one man who will be wondering what comes next. Under Amorim, Mason Mount was a firm favourite and his performances were impressive.",

      "He scored two of his three goals this season in a three-match spell which cemented him in the former head coach's plans. After the second of these strikes in the 4-1 win at Wolves, Amorim went out of his way to hail the performance of Mount.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me [to see Mount doing well],\" Amorim said. \"He's a different type of leader. It's not like Licha [Lisandro Martinez], for example. It's a guy that leads by the example.",
      "\"It doesn't matter the situation, Mason Mount is always the same thing - training, talking, dealing with people around Carrington. That is not easy, so he's a very, very good player.\"",
      "Fastforward two months and suddenly Mount's time at United is in serious jeopardy again. The change to the 4-2-3-1 formation has seen Mount suffer a similar fate to Kobbie Mainoo earlier in the campaign.",
      "Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes celebrate as Manchester United beat Crystal Palace(Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The former Chelsea man is now battling for just one spot in this side, rather than two, and that battle is against Fernandes. It does not matter who the head coach is, Fernandes will always be the first name on the teamsheet.",
      "So if Mount is not starting as the central attacking midfielder in this team, the question is where does he fit? He has previously played on the left and right but he is not threatening to start on either flank.",
      "On the left is Matheus Cunha and now Dorgu; while on the right Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are holding down the fort. This leaves Mount in the wilderness.",
      "At 27, he is in the prime of his career, but even when fit he does not have a regular place in this side. A lack of United fixtures this campaign has not helped but it poses the question as to what United should do with Mount? He has two years remaining on his contract so a fee in the region of £20m would be enough to avoid United making a loss under PSR.",

      "That price could tempt a potential buyer but his recent injury record, coupled with his United wage, could put potential suitors off. But it is starting to become impossible to see a scenario where he can stay at United especially when he risks losing the best years of his career as a back-up option.",
      "Back in December, you would not have thought Mount would be faced with the prospect of considering his options elsewhere. That now feels like the only way forward.",

      "Carrick has made a big impact.(Image: MUTV)",
      "Michael Carrick has praised Leny Yoro, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad for their work in Manchester United's draw with West Ham. Carrick looked set to taste his first defeat since his interim appointment, but Benjamin Sesko scored an injury-time goal to rescue a point at the London Stadium.",
      "Yoro produced two important blocks to prevent West Ham from extending their one-goal lead. The Frenchman was introduced to the game in the 68th minute to replace Harry Maguire",
      "Mbeumo provided the assist for Sesko's match-winner, but his work rate out of possession was praised by United head coach Carrick, who was also impressed with Amad's tracking back to help his teammates.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "“That's the goal, I think - connecting with the players and everyone,” Carrick told club media when asked about the impression he’s made in the dressing room. \"I think it’s important for us all to feel that we're really together, you know, whether that's the boys that are starting games, the boys that are coming on, the rest of the squad, staff, certainly the supporters.",
      "“I think it’s what we've become used to for a long period of time in this football club, and this is what makes it special, so we’ve got to use that, because it's quite unique.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "“You talk about the spirit and togetherness, at the West Ham game Ben gets a lot of the headlines, and rightly so because it was a massive moment and he’s done great, but the other side of it is the spirit.",
      "“Leny [Yoro] has done great, two counter-attacks and putting two big challenges in, Bryan [Mbeumo]’s recovery runs, Amad’s recovery runs. It’s quite easy to lose that game 2-0 in those circumstances, but that’s when the spirit counts and I’ve spoken to the players about that.",
      "“Spirit doesn’t come from scoring late and the big highlights, spirit comes from tougher situations and finding your way through it and working together.",
      "\"The sacrifice that they give, ultimately lets us take something from the game, so there’s a lot goes into it but that connection, that spirit, that’s what we’ve got to use, for the good and for the tough situations as well.”",
      "Carrick was named Premier League manager of the month for January after wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. “It’s nice and it shows that we’ve had a very good start,\" he said.",

      "He added: “The boys have been good. It’s not easy with change and to click into gear and to perform the way they have done in different types of games has probably been as pleasing as anything.",
      "“Obviously the first two games, in some ways, they take care of themselves because of the emotion and how everyone’s kind of up for them, but the games after them have been, for me, just as good to see the boys’ reaction and the quality of the play.",
      "“Going into those games, it was challenging and then, three days before the City game [me and the staff] come in… again, that's why I credit the players for putting themselves forward really, and reacting to change.",
      "“But certainly those two games give you a massive boost of all sorts of emotions to use moving forward, which was the key. After those games are done, it’s what happens next and that's what I've been really delighted with, the reaction after that.”",

      "Casemiro, JJ Gabriel and Manuel Ugarte",
      "Manchester United kept the momentum rolling this week as Benjamin Sesko scored another injury-time goal to secure a point away at West Ham. That means Michael Carrick is now unbeaten in five games in charge at Old Trafford and with Chelsea also dropping points, they remain in a strong position to secure Champions League football.",
      "United have now started a 13-day break between the draw with West Ham and the trip to Everton on February 23, but as ever with this club, there is plenty to discuss. We asked for your questions, and you delivered.",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions, so click here to submit your questions, and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "Could Ugarte be loaned out? He needs to improve a lot, we are conceding a lot of goals when he comes on the pitch and we have thrown away some leads when he has come on.",
      "Ugarte's stock is pretty low at the moment and the stats make for grim reading. His introduction against Fulham when United then lost control of the game might well be the final straw.",
      "A loan is put forward as the solution by one reader and there was interest in taking the Uruguayan on loan in January, but I think that will be a last resort for United. It seems clear Ugarte is never going to make it at United. He doesn't look suited to the Premier League and his passing isn't good enough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "I think there will be a desire to sell him this summer, but that might be easier said than done. Don't rule out a loan with an option or obligation to buy, which is increasingly becoming the way of things with players leaving the Premier League for Europe.",
      "Why can't United extend Casemiro's contract by a year?",
      "We had quite a few questions on Casemiro and all related to this one. Why can't he stay for another year? On form at the moment, you could make the argument he is one of the most important players in the squad.",
      "But it is often about knowing when the right time is to say goodbye, and the feeling is that we have reached that point this summer. Casemiro turns 34 in a couple of weeks and if United return to Europe next season, he would find the demands of two games a week much more difficult.",
      "The rhythm of this season has benefited him, but it probably won't next season. His salary would also go back up to around £350,000-a-week and that is a burden United don't want to carry, especially if he couldn't play every game.",
      "Replacing him won't be easy, but it feels like this is the right time to part ways.",
      "My concern is about the defence because we are conceding too many goals. What is being done to address this?",
      "We have had a few questions on the defence recently and concerns about the team conceding too many goals, many of them, it should be said, before the clean sheet against Tottenham.",
      "It was interesting to hear Carrick reference his frustration at conceding such a soft goal at West Ham on Tuesday. He was pleased that his team stuck at it and found a way to score, but it could have been a winner rather than an equaliser, but for some poor defending.",
      "Generally, however, I think the defence has improved under Carrick. Two clean sheets in five games is the same number achieved in the 22 games before he took over.",
      "The partnership between Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez is also looking strong. I think they offer a good balance and I'm told they love playing alongside each other. That has only ever happened 16 times in a back four for United.",
      "Will JJ Gabriel play any matches with the senior team?",
      "It's been an interesting week for 15-year-old JJ Gabriel, who was sent off for United Under-18s in a Premier League Cup quarter-final win against West Brom on Tuesday before the red card was overturned on Thursday.",
      "The forward will now be eligible to play for the United-18s against Oxford next week, but in terms of the senior team, we will have to wait until pre-season and then maybe the 2026/27 season to get a glimpse of him.",
      "Gabriel is too young to be eligible to play in the Premier League this season and while he could have played in the FA Cup, it was considered too soon for him.",
      "He doesn't turn 16 until October, but with plenty of first-team players likely to be at the World Cup this summer, I think there is a good chance we see him in pre-season. He has already trained with the first team.",
      "United only have one specialist player for right-back and left-wing in Dalot and Cunha. Could they sign Rafael Leao and Martim Fernandes to fix this?",
      "I'll be honest, I don't think I've ever seen Fernandes play. A quick Google search suggests a promising player. I would argue United do have two right-backs, in Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui. If there's a criticism, it is that they are maybe too similar. There is maybe an argument to bring in a more attacking right-back.",
      "That is a position on United's long-term list, but it won't be a top priority this summer. That will be revamping the midfield, and there will be a desire to look at the left wing as well.",
      "I reported last week that they are monitoring Yan Diomande at RB Leipzig. The 19-year-old is having a brilliant season but there could be competition for his signature. I've not heard anything to suggest they hold an interest in Leao.",
      "I have often thought Lisandro Martinez would be perfect as a holding midfielder to replace Casemiro. Is this possible?",
      "A couple of people suggested this. Martinez did play 45 minutes as a holding midfielder at Aston Villa just before Christmas and he played there a little bit for Ajax, but it's not an option United will look at long-term.",
      "Martinez is an outstanding centre-back, possibly the best at the club. He is also left-footed, which offers great balance in defence. He plays there because it's his best position and even if he were to be moved, it would only open up another problem in the centre of defence.",

      "Harry Amass pictured in his only appearance for Norwich City(Image: Izzy Poles - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United academy star Harry Amass has had a bizarre 2025/26 season. The teenager moved to Championship strugglers Sheffield Wednesday on last summer's deadline day and enjoyed his first spell of regular senior football in the English second tier. During his time in South Yorkshire, Amass came under fire from previous United head coach Ruben Amorim in a press conference.",
      "In December, the Portuguese boss suggested Amass was 'struggling' at the bottom of the Championship, to which the youngster responded by posting a picture of himself with a player of the month award. Amorim then doubled down and claimed some of the club's academy players were entitled.",
      "Following that spat, Amass returned to United in January and despite clubs pushing for promotion to the Premier League being interested in his services, the defender completed a move to Norwich City, who were, at the time, hovering above the relegation zone. But speaking to MEN Sport, The Pink Un's chief Norwich City reporter Connor Southwell explained why United chose Carrow Road as the best destination for their man.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"You look at some of the other clubs mentioned, Stoke and Watford are two who I know liked him, it was a surprise to everyone,\" Southwell said when asked why Norwich won the race to sign him. \"When [Lucien] Mahovo got injured, they had to dig into that database of players they have and the recruitment team pulled out Harry’s name very quickly. Philippe Clement watched him, really liked him and then it progressed from there.",
      "\"The fact Norwich were able to get him was a major coup when you look at his career and not just where he is at at the moment, but also where he could get to. It is clear Manchester United really rate him highly.",
      "\"I recognise where Norwich were in the league but since Philippe Clement has come in, anyone who has watched them would argue they are not a team really in danger of relegation. They have shown that in the last few weeks with the run of form they have been on.\"",
      "Clement is a manager many United fans will be aware of, having previously been in the dugout for Rangers, AS Monaco and Club Brugge. Southwell believes the 51-year-old will have been a big factor in persuading Amass to move to Norfolk.",
      "He added: \"Clement as a coach is a blend of being a little bit of a throwback in terms of being big on man-management and knows how to get into a player’s psyche and knows how to get the best out of them. But also, tactically, he is quite modern, quite flexible and what we have seen so far from Norwich is that he has been able to take a group - which is the youngest in the Championship by far - and improved not just one or two of the players but the bulk of the players.\"",
      "Amass first caught Southwell's eye in November when Wednesday drew 1-1 with Norwich at Hillsborough. \"From a fan’s perspective, there was a lot of excitement,\" he explained.",
      "Harry Amass pictured during his loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday earlier in the season",
      "\"Norwich played them in November and I kind of walked away from that game thinking his name was the one I was really impressed by because of how he played and the bravery he showed. His ability to adapt to the robustness of the Championship at such a young age was really impressive. You look at some of the teams who were linked and the fact Norwich were able to get to the front of that queue was really encouraging.\"",
      "The youngster made his debut for the Canaries in a 2-1 win over the league leaders at the time, Coventry City, but the first impression Amass gave raised eyebrows among those covering Norwich and supporting from the stands. \"The first impression was probably not the one we expected because his only minutes for Norwich came as a right winger which I don’t think any of us expected,\" Southwell laughed.",
      "\"He came off the bench in that win against Coventry and I don’t think that is something Harry expected, there was a few eyebrows raised. But that gets to the heart of what could have been.\"",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as a Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "Alas, left-back Amass has picked up an injury since his unusual debut at right wing. Clement has described the injury as being serious and it is expected the United youngster will miss most of this season, albeit he could return for the run-in.",
      "In a double blow for Amass, Southwell believes it is unlikely the Canaries will come back in for him next summer as they would prefer to develop their own left-backs in Ben Chrisene and Mahovo.",
      "\"All of that makes it really disappointing,\" he concluded. \"I think Harry Amass would have had a lot of fun with Norwich and Norwich would have had a lot of fun with Harry, it is just a shame that injury has cut that short.",
      "\"It felt like this was a good chance for him to progress and continue that upward trajectory at Norwich in a team that is improving and is getting better under a coach who is getting the best out of individual players. I don’t think it has totally ended but it has been cut short drastically from what it would have been if he had been fit still.\"",

Ratcliffe said the United Kingdom was being \"colonised\" by immigrants during an interview with Sky News, citing inaccurate population figures to back up his point.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been brilliant since returning to the Manchester United team",
      "It is set to be the year of the midfield at Manchester United. If 2025 was all about revamping the attack, the focus this summer is going to fall on the centre of the pitch. United will target two new midfielders this summer, with one tasked with replacing Casemiro, who will leave at the end of the season when his contract expires.",
      "Manuel Ugarte is also likely to move on and there is every chance the midfield options available to whoever the head coach is at the start of the 2026/27 season will look a lot different to now.",
      "But six weeks ago, there was a fear that the entire midfield might need to be rebuilt. Bruno Fernandes had thrust his own future back into the news and Kobbie Mainoo's chances of playing under Ruben Amorim looked as distant as ever.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes now looks happy and settled again and Champions League football would surely convince the club captain to stay on, while no player has had a bigger transformation under Michael Carrick than Mainoo.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The academy graduate is not only back in the team, but looking like the player who enjoyed a spectacular breakthrough in the second half of the 2023/24 season. For all the talk of United signing a £100million midfielder this summer, Mainoo's recent form is a reminder they might already have one on their hands. He was the best player on the pitch in Saturday's win against Tottenham.",
      "“There's definitely more to come from him, and that's just the age he's at, the stage he's at in his career. He’s just starting out, essentially,\" Carrick said after watching Mainoo run the show.",
      "“He’s got so much experience under his belt of big occasions, big games, and pressurised situations. That's going to help him develop and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up, just playing next to him as well as the other players around him.",
      "“I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop. As I said, I'm really conscious that he's come in, he's played the four games, and he's found his rhythm. Young players will have times when they're up, and then they might have a little dip, that's not all of a sudden, he's good, or he's a poor player. Kobbie is what he is.",
      "“Managing that's really important, especially for younger players, and understanding that. So he's done fantastic at the moment. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go.”",
      "The irony of that is that Mainoo is actually one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, as he is still on the contract he signed as a 17-year-old in February 2023. His return to the starting XI has again triggered bonuses, but that still leaves him short of many of his teammates.",
      "Now that he is back in the fold, there is a desire to fix that. United never had any intention of letting their prized academy graduate leave and now they will show him how much he is valued by opening talks over a new deal, with the hope they can be concluded by the end of the season.",
      "That would be a significant boost ahead of the summer. On this form, Mainoo is one of the first names on the teamsheet, and with Fernandes as the starting No.10, there is only one spot left to fill in the strongest team. It is easy to imagine someone like Elliot Anderson coming in and finishing off that midfield trio.",
      "Whatever business United end up doing this summer, securing a new contract for Mainoo might be the best of it. He is the poster boy for the academy in recent years, as well as a brilliant footballer when shown the faith that Carrick has given him in recent weeks.",
      "He is also only 20 and there is clearly more to come, as Carrick explained on Saturday. This is a player who started the European Championship final at 18, and he should be part of United's midfield for years to come. Giving him a contract that reflects that status is now crucial.",
      "Mainoo has just over a year left on his existing deal, with the option of another 12 months, but United know he needs a new contract. If that is signed and sealed before the summer, then it will be one significant piece of business completed before the window opens.",

      "One Manchester United fan will be hoping his side's trip to the London Stadium on Tuesday is anything but a close shave, with a first haircut in nearly 500 days resting on the outcome of the game.",
      "Frank Ilett vowed not to get a trim until United won five games in a row in October 2024 and his wild locks have grown out of control since then, with the troubles under Ruben Amorim meaning he's not even gone close to seeing a pair of scissors.",
      "United only once managed to win three in a row under Amorim, but the appointment of Michael Carrick has led to a change in fortunes and Ilett is now 90 minutes away from booking in with the barber.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "His stance has won him more than one million followers on social media and it hasn't been popular with all United supporters, who see him feeding off a difficult era for the club. Tuesday will be day 493 since Frank last had a haircut but victory for United will put an end to his mammoth challenge and Carrick admits he is aware of the ongoing saga, mostly thanks to his children.",
      "Carrick's priority is strengthening United's grip on a Champions League place rather than landing a fan a haircut and he joked the story wouldn't be making it into the team talk at the London Stadium.",
      "\"I can say I'm aware of it, yeah,\" said Carrick. \"My kids have made me aware of it, if anything, but it certainly won't go into the team talk from a professional level, but I can understand what's going on with it and it does make me smile but it won't have an impact ultimately in the end.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has backed Michael Carrick to have a good career as a manager",
      "Michael Carrick is keeping his feet firmly pinned to the floor despite hearing Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes label him a \"great manager\" after making it four wins in a row against Tottenham.",
      "It's more than three years since United last won five Premier League games in a row, but that is the prize on offer at the London Stadium tomorrow, when they face a West Ham side in good form themselves as they battle against relegation.",
      "Carrick has engineered an impressive turnaround at Old Trafford and United are now firmly in the box seat in the race for Champions League football next season. The 44-year-old's impressive start since being appointed head coach until the end of the season is also putting him in contention to get the job on a long-term basis.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Fernandes gave the impression he would be happy to see Carrick stay on after the win against Spurs. It extended the former midfielder's record in the job to six wins and a draw from seven games, having stood in as caretaker for three matches in November 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked.",
      "During that run, Fernandes told Carrick that he thought he would make a great manager. Now back at Old Trafford, he is proving that prophecy right. United are conducting what they describe as a \"thorough process\" to appoint their next head coach and although Carrick is refusing to get carried away, he is putting himself in the frame.",
      "Asked about Fernandes' comments ahead of the trip to West Ham, he insisted there was more to achieve this season before any thoughts turn to staying on.",
      "\"I've known Bruno for quite some time and I know him pretty well, and seen him the odd time in the time that I've left the club, so I've got a really good relationship with him,\" he said.",
      "\"He's a really intelligent footballer, he's bright, he cares a lot for this club, so in terms of that side of it, we all want the same thing. It's obviously nice when players that you respect, as I do with Bruno a lot, say good things about you, but ultimately it's about the team, getting the best out of the team, and actually that's all working together.",
      "\"So time will tell. It's not about judging how good or successful at this moment in time, because nothing's really happened yet. We've hopefully got a lot more to do between now and the end of the season, and see what happens after that.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick is repeating his mantra of not getting carried away by the start he is enjoying at Old Trafford. He engineered a similar upturn in form when he was appointed Middlesbrough boss in October 2022, winning 16 of his first 23 games, but his side fell short in the play-offs.",
      "Despite his cool persona, Carrick is trying to enjoy the highs of winning and ride the emotion that comes with those successes, but he knows there is more to do if United are to return to the Champions League next season.",
      "\"It's a really easy thing to say, and listen, part of it, you've got to enjoy the buzz of winning. That's what we're in it for,\" he said.",
      "\"You've got to manage the highs of it and you've got to enjoy initially the feeling of winning a game. You can't just be flat-lined the whole time, but certainly going into the next game, you've got to then regroup and prepare again for what's next.",
      "\"You definitely take the confidence and the feeling from the games that you've had knowing you can go into the next game with a little bit more feel-good factor about it, but I guess the big challenge is knowing what's got you there and all the hard work and the preparation and then what it takes to win a game of football at this level is tough, so never assuming the next one's just going to be alright.",
      "\"But you've still got to allow yourself to feel the little bits and waves of emotion with it. It’s all a little bit boring and pointless if you didn't really to be honest, winning games is what we're all striving for.\"",

      "\"He's, of course, won a lot when he was here as a player. So he understands the club, and I think that's the biggest thing for me. He knows how to get the best out of the players, and he's really doing that.",
      "\"Of course, winning football matches is always going to make everyone feel better, and the confidence is at a real high. We can't take our foot off the pedal. We just have to keep going and keep pushing each other.\"",
      "When asked whether it was Carrick's understanding of how United should play that had made the difference, Shaw responded: \"No, everything, it's everything. Of course, the culture is extremely important, and day in, day out, how we are as a team, how the mentality is, how the focus is.",
      "\"How we push each other day in, day out, that's one thing Carrick has brought it, and I think everyone's just really enjoying themselves at the moment. You see how important not just the starting XI are, it's the ones that are coming off the bench as well, making an impact.",

      "Michael Carrick congratulates Kobbie Mainoo as he comes off during Manchester United's 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur(Image: Mike Morese/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "It is hard to believe that Kobbie Mainoo could have been on his way out of Old Trafford last month. Mainoo attempted to force an exit to gain more minutes but his plea fell on deaf ears. The 20-year-old had to knuckle down and hope for a change in fortunes. Fortunately, that change came in January.",
      "Amorim's outburst at Leeds would be the final nail in the coffin for him as he was sacked less than 24 hours later. The following week, Michael Carrick was appointed. United have since gone on to win four games in a row with Mainoo starting all of them.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Remarkably, Mainoo has shown few signs of rustiness upon his return to the starting line-up and has become a crucial player for the Reds. While his individual performances have rightly been heralded, Carrick's message post-Tottenham suggests United need to be careful with their transfer business in the summer to keep the momentum going with Mainoo.",
      "\"That's going to help him develop, learn the game and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up,\" Carrick said. \"Just playing next to him as well as the other players around him - I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that Mainoo is still one of the youngest players in the squad. He has enjoyed more exposure with United and England than most players could even dream of, but he is still in the development stage of his career. That is why United need to be very careful in the next summer transfer window as they look to overhaul their midfield.",
      "Casemiro will be departing the club at the end of his contract. While that is the right decision for all involved, it does mean United are losing someone who Carrick believes is mentoring Mainoo without the youngster even knowing it. The direct replacement for Casemiro will be a much younger player with a high ceiling.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba has been on the United radar since last summer and remains on it despite a difficult campaign to date. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson are also highly rated by those at Old Trafford. But those players do not boast a wealth of experience playing at the highest level, and Mainoo needs a mentor to help him reach his full potential.",
      "If United do sign one of Baleba, Wharton or Anderson to strengthen their midfield, they also need to add a more experienced head who they and Mainoo can learn from.",
      "The risk with allowing Casemiro to leave was the fact there are few midfielders with his experience - not only in the Premier League but in European football. It still remains the right call to allow the Brazilian to depart but Carrick has reminded United just how important it is to not completely sacrifice experience as they rebuild their midfield this summer.",

      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",

      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",

      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",

      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "McTominay progressed through the ranks at Man Utd and made 255 appearances across all competitions for the Red Devils before leaving in 2024.",
      "The Scotland international was regularly criticised during his time at Man Utd as some argued that he was not good enough for the Premier League giants, but he shone for them during their dire 2023/24 campaign.",
      "McTominay impressed from an advanced role as he scored ten goals in all competitions, but club chiefs opted to offload him to raise funds. He joined Napoli in a deal worth around £26m.",

This proposal includes a substantial salary increase that would raise his earnings to 5.5 million euros net per season.",
      "‘This figure would place the full-back on the same salary scale as other key players in the Italian national team, such as Alessandro Bastoni and midfielder Nicolò Barella.

      "‘What has changed since his short-term appointment?’ Dunn asks.",
      "The long-term managerial situations at Manchester United, Real Madrid and Spurs. And very possibly Manchester City past this summer. That all feels quite important when discussing a world-class manager who has been mentioned in regards to those roles, and whose current employers might wish for him not to join the pool of best available coaches.",
      "He also might have really enjoyed his time in charge thus far, with England sensing he is the best current candidate for the job and it is worth cutting predictable speculation off at the source before it becomes distracting? Dunno, just spitballing.",

      "‘You can rest assured the FA would not be happy if United approached Tuchel in the build-up to the finals. That, though, should not be United’s concern,’ he said.",

      "‘As it stands right now,’ Dunn wrote in January, ‘Tuchel is available towards the end of July – no compensation payment required. But Ruben Amorim’s departure and United’s current situation will be the subject of a lot of discussion in the corridors of Football Association power.’",
      "Yet now they’re being criticised by the same writer in February for ensuring that isn’t a factor worth considering ahead of a major international tournament.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “colonised by immigrants” have caused ‘alarm’ among the Manchester United players, who believe the Red Devils co-owner is ‘out of touch’ and have ‘noted’ the double standards at play.",
      "United co-owner Ratcliffe made the misguided statement in a scathing interview about the immigration system and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in which he claimed the UK will face huge economic problems as pressure increases on the welfare state to aid incoming foreigners.",
      "The 73-year-old was given the full c-word treatment in the Mailbox after he also made clear his respect for Reform party leader Nigel Farage in his interview with Sky News.",
      "After coming under severe scrutiny and with Starmer himself insisting the comments were “offensive and wrong”, Ratcliffe offered a half-baked apology before Manchester United released their own statement, which the Daily Mail claim ‘was worked upon for hours and involved a delicate balancing act between all parties’.",
      "The statement read: ‘Manchester United prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club.",
      "‘Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.",
      "‘Since launching All Red All Equal in 2016, we have embedded equality, diversity and inclusion into everything we do.",
      "‘We remain deeply committed to the principles and spirit of that campaign. They are reflected in our policies but also in our culture and are reinforced by our holding of the Premier League’s Advanced Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Standard.",
      "‘Over the course of this season, we have participated in events and initiatives at our men’s and women’s games marking mental health, LGBTQ+ inclusion, No Room for Racism, violence against women and girls and homophobic chanting.",
      "‘We have also celebrated our supporters’ clubs’ events, including our Disabled Supporters’ Association’s Christmas Party and our Jewish Supporters’ Club’s Chanukah event. In the weeks and months ahead, we will be supporting further initiatives in these areas.",
      "‘This all sits alongside the incredible work which the Manchester United Foundation undertakes in and around Manchester on a daily basis.",
      "‘Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent. We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.’",
      "But the Daily Mail add that ‘some of the players were alarmed’ by Ratcliffe’s comments and ‘one insider warned it wouldn’t sit well within the dressing room’, which features 17 overseas players.",
      "It’s claimed those players ‘put the controversy down to a 73-year-old who is out of touch’ and they’ve ‘noted that Ratcliffe is unlikely to face the same action from the FA or the club as one of them if they made similar comments in public’.",
      "A Man Utd star has ‘no words’ for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has ‘a lot to answer for’ after his ‘colonised by immigrants’ comments.",
      "Man Utd have made their stance on inclusivity perfectly clear after Sir Jim Ratcliffe issued a non-apology for his “colonised by immigrants” comments.",
      "The Ruben Amorim era was bad enough but going for immigrants and those on benefits – the daft, old hypocrite – is top of Sir Jim Ratcliffe 20 mistakes at ...",
      "Jim Ratcliffe suggested this week that the UK had been “colonised” by immigrants and made an incorrect claim about the population.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a ‘colossal t*t’ who deserves a colossal kicking for his views on immigration.",

      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new players in the summer transfer window with Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Senne Lammens all joining the Premier League club.",
      "However, the early parts of the season didn’t go to plan with Man Utd continuing their inconsistent form from the previous season under Ruben Amorim.",

      "“Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there’s a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "“Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It’s a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that’s why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "“Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we’re talking over £100m.”",

      "The Uruguay international is ‘fed up’ with Arbeloa and is unhappy at the possibility of the Spaniard ‘continuing as manager and has already expressed his concerns to the Real Madrid hierarchy’.",
      "Sources close to the Real Madrid midfielder have said that ‘his message is that if the coach stays for another season, he will request a transfer in the summer to avoid having to work under him any longer’.",
      "Valverde ‘believes that the manager’s methods and internal management are not aligned with what the team needs at this time’ and it’s understood that this ‘discontent has been building and has led the Uruguayan to be very clear about the manager’s future’.",
      "The report adds: ‘In this scenario, Manchester United ‘s interest has emerged strongly. The English club has already made preliminary contact with the player’s representatives to explore a possible move in the upcoming transfer window. At Old Trafford, they highly value his profile for the Premier League, where he would be well-suited to take on responsibility in big matches.’",
      "The report continues: ‘If the manager ultimately stays and the Uruguayan follows through on his threat, the summer will heat up with high-stakes negotiations. Manchester United are reportedly prepared to make a substantial offer to convince the club, while  Valverde prioritizes an ambitious project where he feels valued and respected in his position on the pitch.’",

      "“It could be a route back for Marcus Rashford at Man Utd, definitely,” Meulensteen told BetGoat. “I think Marcus is still as ‘red’ as anyone because he came through the ranks as a young kid, and that will never go away, that will never leave him.",
      "“It’s the same with Scott McTominay. Both players have done extremely well wherever they’ve gone. But I think it was good for Marcus to have that spell away, first of all at Aston Villa, but now at Barcelona. It’s a different culture, a different language, and a different style. Every week is different.",

      "Man Utd ‘will not budge’ but Barcelona are looking to tempt them into possible swap deals for the 28-year-old.",
      "“Yes, definitely,” Deco told Sport when asked if he and the rest of the board are pleased with Rashford’s progress. “I think it wasn’t easy to come here. He has played at a very high level, with enormous demands at a club like Manchester United.",
      "“Then he spent six months at Aston Villa, where he did a very good job. In fact, Aston Villa, they would have kept him if it had been possible. I know this because I’ve spoken to people there.",
      "“But he only wanted to come to Barca, and that’s a very positive thing. We were able to secure a loan. The fact that he took a pay cut to make it happen is a clear demonstration that he really wanted to come, and we’re very happy about that. He’s a player who contributes a lot to the team.”",
      "Deco, 48, is right in that the salary sacrifice was a vital contribution to get Rashford’s Barcelona loan over the line. The Spanish powerhouse’s finances wouldn’t allow them to sign him on his previous £300,000 a week terms at United, and he agreed to reduce his fee to £225,000 a week to make the move happen.",

      "And yet, the Catalan skin-flints are looking at ways to reduce or even cancel out that cost through offering players in exchange. A report from Spain put two possible names forward and we’ve added another four reasonable swap options.",

      "No Barcelona player has scored more than Torres’ 16 goals this season, but a footballer who’s been linked with the Nou Camp exit pretty much ever since he arrived from Manchester City for £48m in January 2022 remains one of the big lever-less sources of cash in the eyes of the decision-makers ahead of his contract expiring in 2027.",
      "Reports suggest Barcelona will choose between Torres and Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season, and with eyes now permanently fixed on their coffers, we suspect granting Lewandowski an extension on reduced terms (something he’s amenable to) while either selling £43m-rated Torres or using him in the deal for Rashford, will be the preference of the bean-counters over signing Torres up to a new contract and allowing Lewandowski to leave for nothing.",

      "A report has claimed Barcelona ‘would include’ Casado – who’s valued at £22m and has started 12 games this season – in a deal for Rashford as they’re ‘willing to do without’ him.",
      "Assuming United end up spending big on one of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton or Carlos Baleba as has been reported, they could do with their second central midfield signing – and they will need another – to cost very little, or indeed feel like not outlay whatsoever, as would be the case in a swap with Rashford.",

The Netherlands international has never given any indication of interest in a move to Old Trafford because he, well, plays for Barcelona.",
      "He’s got a lot of contract too, having signed an extension until 2029 in October, making this the most pie in the sky option of all on this list. You never know though; he’s valued by Transfermarkt at just £40m and cynics will suggest that Barcelona extending his deal was more a means to ensure a decent transfer fee should United or other suitors come knocking.",

      "After buying his stake in Manchester United almost two years ago, Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted he and his INEOS team had “made a lot of cock-ups” in his other footballing ventures, Lausanne and Nice, presumably in a bid to convince the Red Devils fans that they had learned lessons from those mistakes that would not be repeated at Old Trafford.",
      "“Huge change” off the pitch certainly hasn’t been for the better on it. Ruben Amorim is the latest – and worst – post-Ferguson Manchester United manager to be sacked, seemingly more for challenging Jason Wilcox and the board rather than the turgid sh*te he was serving up on the pitch.",
      "Regardless, those who made the call to appoint Amorim and have ultimately swung the axe on him ought to be held accountable for that and myriad other questionable strategic calls and ill-advised comments in interviews that are among the mistakes we’ve listed here, including some that the Ratcliffe advocates will claim weren’t his decisions, but – despite his clear ethos of passing it wherever possible – the buck stops with him.",
      "Anyway, strap yourselves in: Ratcliffe’s mistakes ranked from minor to major.",
      "",
      "It doesn’t seem all that unreasonable for a struggling organisation not to hand out £100 Christmas bonuses and instead give members of staff a £40 M&S voucher, and the employees themselves may well have been fine had it been explained to them properly and hadn’t been part of a widespread cost-cutting scheme that’s seen many of their friends and colleagues made redundant while what we assume is now half-ply loo paper is on hand the toilets.",
      "“At least the Glazers prioritised families,” said one staffer. “And anuses,” said another, probably.",
      "",
      "We suspect the Manchester United fans were delighted to hear about Ratcliffe and Ineos’ plan to conduct a ‘thorough strategic review’ of the football club when the British billionaire took charge of all football operations. After years of Glazer family negligence, on and off the pitch, it was necessary.",
      "But while we imagined people in hard hats pointing to leaks in the Old Trafford roof and football coaching svengali Jason Wilcox shaking his head on the side-lines of an Erik ten Hag training session, we didn’t foresee Big Sir Jim himself picking up dirty socks from the academy dressing room.",
      "It’s a level of scrutiny that in some ways reflects well on the fourth-richest man in Britain – he has a hands-on approach – but upon describing the cleanliness of the youth team changing rooms as a ‘disgrace’, along with many of the other facilities on his tour of the club in a leaked whole staff email, Ratcliffe immediately managed to ‘create a toxic feeling inside Carrington’.",
      "He labelled the Manchester United museum – quite possibly the pride and joy of several members of staff – a load of ‘crap’, and in a bid to end the work-from-home culture, told employees to head back to the offices, despite there not being enough desks for them all to work from. ‘If you don’t like it, please seek alternative employment,’ he told them.",
      "Your Simon Jordans claimed it was a necessary shake-up, a method of sorting the wheat from the chaff, but there’s also little doubt that some very capable employees – not necessarily all Gen Z woke snowflakes – won’t have enjoyed Ratcliffe’s authoritarian day-one approach, will have taken it as a bleak sign of what was to come and taken a job in a more forward-thinking environment.",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe’s claim that a “conversation” with the government was required after proposing that Old Trafford is redeveloped into the ‘Wembley of the North’ was galling, to put it mildly.",
      "The suggestion was that the burden of financing United’s next chapter should be shared between him, a man worth around £11bn, and the taxpayers. A brazen proposal even before you consider that Ratcliffe himself is a tax exile having officially changed his residence in 2020 from Hampshire to Monaco in a move estimated to have saved him £4bn, which is enough to build two Wembleys of wherever.",
      "",
      "We all know the guy – it’s always a guy – who suddenly appears one day, is overly friendly in a bid to gain confidences, laughing and joking one second and comically stern the next to keep everyone on their toes. Can be seen staring at walls and slowly stirring tea before snapping out of what we assume is a daydream about making a suit of human skins to ask if you’d like a cup. Yeahhh y’know, that guy.",
      "Ratcliffe’s ‘spy’ is said to be one of the Ineos chiefs taking roles and ‘assuming greater importance’ at the club, deepening what several sources described as a “growing culture of fear”, with staff members tiptoeing around this particular individual for fear of the sack, ‘being extra vigilant about what they say in his presence’.",
      "",
      "In order to give Manchester United the best chance of on-field success, no saving is off-limits in the Ratcliffe regime, as those travelling to the FA Cup final discovered.",
      "As joyous as that day became, any staff attending did so without recourse to former privileges. They each paid £20 towards travel costs that previously came as a perk of the job, while packed lunches were also seen as a luxury they could do without by the penny-pinchers at a club that saved a whopping £6,500 on the day before revealing record revenues of £660m shortly after the Wembley win.",
      "Top lad Bruno Fernandes offered to pay for the staff travel but the Ineos chiefs rejected that proposal because they thought ‘it would reflect badly on the regime’, and apparently didn’t think anyone would have an issue with ‘thousands being shelled out on chauffeured cars’ to take them to the very same event.",
      "",
      "Not nearer the top because they only ‘considered it’ but even thinking about cutting the disabled supporters’ association budget in half is deplorable.",
      "As David Ornsein said, it’s “terrible optics” for a football club that has routinely spunked tens of millions of pounds on average footballers to believe that a viable and reasonable method of cutting costs is to make the lives of their disabled supporters harder. The audacity would almost be impressive if it wasn’t so shameful.",
      "",
      "It would be unreasonable for Ratcliffe to know the name of all, or even most, Manchester United employees. There are a lot of them; far too many in his opinion. But we reckon the captain of the football club should have been in the top ten names learned by Ratcliffe before he rocked up.",
      "We would have thought Katie Zelem wearing a training kit and boots might have been a bit of a giveaway as Ratcliffe doddered towards her like a 99-year-old royal and asked: “And what do you do, little lady?” Disappointed that the competition winner hadn’t curtsied as he approached.",
      "",
      "One good decision Ratcliffe has made was to end the club’s financial commitment to Sir Alex Ferguson. Cutting the jobs of 250 Normal People while continuing to pay £2m to a manager who retired over a decade ago would have been laughable, legend or not.",
      "But the co-owner can consider himself very fortunate that Ferguson still has his ear to the Old Trafford ground having reportedly advised him against an extraordinary move that would have been a PR disaster of epic proportions and speaks to Ratcliffe’s lack of knowledge of what’s important to the football club.",
      "Anyone asked about landmark events in the history of Manchester United would talk extensively about the Busby Babes, who came through the youth ranks and were touted to dominate European football before the Munich air disaster. Their story is woven into the fabric of the football club.",
      "What you don’t want to be doing as the new figurehead of Manchester United is dishonouring those young men or anyone associated with them in any way whatsoever, which makes his supposed plan to ‘revoke the privileges given to the families of the Busby Babes at United’ a truly incredible one.",
      "‘The families of players involved in Sir Matt Busby’s legendary side are regulars in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, but the club’s part-owners had threatened to put an end to those positions’ the report claims, with Ratcliffe’s view presumably that those seats could instead be given to very rich people from faceless companies who may throw a few million his way. Find another way, you berk.",
      "",
      "We don’t think we’ve ever heard of a club increasing ticket prices during a season; as MUST said, the idea that the fans must pay their ‘fair share’ for the club’s excesses and/or mismanagement — and above all, the Glazers lack of investment over two decades — is offensive.",
      "And we would suggest that a parent wanting to take their child to a game and having to shell out £132 for the privilege almost certainly doesn’t give a sh*t about the need to improve ‘operational efficiencies’ and ‘stabilise revenues’. They want to watch good football (alright, baby steps) for less than the cost of their monthly council tax.",
      "In response to the backlash, Ratcliffe said Manchester United are “mediocre” (no arguments here) when “it’s supposed to be one of the best football club’s in the world”. And in every interview he gives he talks about this gap between what they once were and what they are, in a We’re All In This Together sort of way, as if he’s suggesting every United fan should be direct debiting part of their salary to fix problems they have nothing to do with.",
      "The money the fans have already given has been wasted for years, and you want them to pay more to watch arguably the worst collection of footballers in Premier League history? Jog on, mate. An ‘outright rebellion’ is in the post.",
      "",
      "Before Ratcliffe arrived, even under the ownership of those horrible Glazers, Manchester United is said to have felt like a family club despite its global reach. Kath Phipps had a helluva lot to do with that.",
      "She first joined the club as the switchboard operator in September 1968, and was seemingly beloved by anyone who came into contact with her, acting as a bridge that crossed multiple eras.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Jonny Evans were among her famous, frequent visitors in her last months in care, with her friends at the club, including several who had been ousted in the cuts, running a daily rota via WhatsApp to ensure she was never alone until her passing, two days after which her next of kin got a phone call from the club.",
      "A message of condolence presumably, maybe from Ratcliffe himself, letting the bereaved individual know that everyone at the club is thinking of them. That should probably be the minimum when the longest-serving employee of the football club you own dies.",
      "But no, what they received was a call from the football club that had been Kath’s life to enquire about the status of her two season tickets. Scarcely believable evidence of the ‘heart and soul’ of the football club eroding under Ratcliffe.",
      "It being the dearly departed Kath Phipps makes it worse, of course it does, but to think that it would also happening to other Manchester United fans is also really, really horrible.",
      "And if you’re one of the many, many United fans currently shouting It’s Not Sir Jim That’s Making The Phone Calls, you’re absolutely right, but while it’s also probably not Ratcliffe forcing the poor member of staff to take on this abhorrent task, it’s he who has created an environment where money needs to be saved at all costs, including the feelings of the very recently bereaved and the once-highly respected reputation of the football club.",
      "",
      "The optics aren’t great when only a few months after staff members were all told they were crucial in helping contribute to on-field success, 250 of them were made redundant as part of Ratcliffe’s determination to slash costs by scrapping ‘non-essential’ activities.",
      "Nearly a quarter of United’s employees lost their jobs and many of them, understandably, may well have pointed out that poor first-team recruitment has wasted far more money than will have been saved by cutting the rank-and-file workforce.",
      "And those redundancies were made before the club spent £200m in the summer of 2024 on further under-performing footballers, and another £200m this summer on players we can only assume will be similarly underwhelming.",
      "Each of the 250 employees would have to be earning £55,000 per year to make getting rid of them more cost effective than paying Matthijs de Ligt his salary, and that’s without considering the centre-back’s transfer fee, which would have been enough to keep those staff members in their jobs on that wage for three years.",
      "",
      "At the end of June, four months after his purchase of 27% of Manchester United (yes, Manchester United as a whole), Ratcliffe was asked whether he had considered spinning off the women’s team, with Chelsea having recently announced that their side will become a standalone entity.",
      "“We haven’t got into that level of detail with the women’s team yet. We’ve been pretty much focused on how we resolve the first team issues.”",
      "We understand why the men’s team is the priority. It’s the cash cow and what him and his team will ultimately be judged upon. But word to the wise Jim, don’t call them ‘the first team’. The women aren’t reserves just because they’re not men.",
      "A slip of the tongue, maybe, but a telling one which when added to him moving the women out of their training facility and into portable buildings to make room for the men, hardly paints Ratcliffe as a beacon of equality.",
      "Asked in the same interview about what they are doing with the women’s team, Ratcliffe replied: “Well they’ve just won the FA Cup” as if he a) cared having not even watched the game, and b) had anything whatsoever to do with that success.",
      "And imagine if he had given the same answer about the men when – as he well knows – the 2024 FA Cup win deflected from a poor league season and much deeper problems. He did not seem to have the same grasp of the issues with the women’s team, who finished 20 points behind champions Chelsea in the WSL that season.",
      "",
      "Instead of sacking Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 (more on that to come) they got rid of his two assistant coaches, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag, replacing them with Rene Hake and Ruud van Nistelrooy, who are arguably the two guys to have been most screwed by Ratcliffe and INEOS’ bungling.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought his own coaches because it would be mad to leave behind the people who have played a significant role in his success at Sporting, meaning Ruud moved to Leicester to destroy his reputation and Rene et al. were out on their ears after three months at Old Trafford.",
      "A lucky escape some would argue and they’ve been well-compensated, as were Sporting for United nicking their manager and coaching staff, which all-in-all left United too close to the PSR line to do anything of significant in January to help Amorim.",
      "",
      "Going for Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez or any other clear No.1 goalkeeper seemed weird, but it can at least be explained away with a view to not paying exorbitant wages and with an eye on the future. But there is no reasonable explanation for spending well over £200m and failing to fix the biggest problem in the team.",
      "No-one at that football club can believe that Manuel Ugarte is good enough, or that Bruno Fernandes can play as one of the two in midfield. They also knew, without doubt, that Amorim isn’t going to change his system. So why the p*ssing hell did they not buy Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfield machine?",
      "Sacking Amorim has solved this one – a temporary fix – with Kobbie Mainoo brought in from the cold to partner Casemiro, whom the football never left after all. But Amorim might say he was sacked because of an arse-about-face recruitment policy that saw United fail to furnish him with the players necessary to make his precious system work, all the while buying an entirely new forward line.",
      "",
      "It now looks as though Ratcliffe has missed the resignation boat as Amorim has now dug his philosophical heels into the Old Trafford turf, insisting after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City that “If they [United hierarchy] want it [the philosophy] changed, you change the man.”",
      "But he had at least one opportunity to get rid of Amorim without the need for compensation, instead opting to talk Amorim down from the ledge following the 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January when he was ‘prepared to resign’, and reports after the embarrassing defeat to Grimsby Town claimed there was once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "It suggests little more than a nudge in that direction may have been required to bring his doomed tenure to an end, saving Ratcliffe a few quid in compo.",
      "",
      "It was very, very funny, and embarrassing to the point where Ratcliffe must have considered ploughing on with a guy he clearly had no time or respect for as sporting director purely to avoid the humiliation.",
      "They spent no little time and money to haul him out of Newcastle, only to mutually consent him out the door after just five months in which the club spent £180m on players who have made next to no difference to their fortunes and hired a new manager who’s now as doomed as the one they got rid of.",
      "Amorim’s appointment was supposedly the big disagreement between Ashworth, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United brains trust, with Ashworth wanting either an English coach (Gareth Southgate specifically), Thomas Frank or for Ruud van Nistelrooy to stay in interim charge until the end of the season. He knew his stuff, eh?",
      "‘Who would you appoint if we sacked Erik ten Hag now?’ should have been the very first question in Ashworth’s interview.",
      "",
      "Handing someone who had just overseen the worst season in the club’s history a contract extension is one of the worst decisions made by anyone ever. They played well once, in the FA Cup final, having embarrassed themselves in the semi-final against Coventry, the entire Champions League campaign and the vast majority of their league fixtures. Manchester United were awful.",
      "Their excuse for not replacing Ten Hag being the lack of suitable alternatives was quickly exposed as nonsense given the manager they’ve now hired was so available in the summer that he flew to London to meet West Ham on the eve of his side’s crunch clash with Porto in their title run-in.",
      "",
      "We were told that Jason Wilcox, brought in as the new technical director, would be the man to ‘determine and drive the move to a clear “game model” – effectively a cohesive playing style and identity United intend to replicate across all age groups.’",
      "And apparently, unbelievably, after ‘providing a detailed assessment of Ten Hag’s strengths and weaknesses’ as the first duty in his new post, Wilcox reported back that not only was Ten Hag the right man for the job, he was also so good at his job that the club should continue to sign players to fit his system rather than individuals with a broader ethos in mind.",
      "Wilcox and the other directors may claim it’s a happy coincidence that the style of their former first-team coach was also the new Manchester United Way, though wouldn’t be at all surprised if the new Manchester United Way is actually more in line with Amorim’s ethos, which has required a host of his players rather than the bunch bought for Ten Hag that clearly aren’t fit for purpose as the perpetual cycle of Red Devils managers being five to six signings away from challenging for the title continues.",
      "",
      "Ashworth ‘warned’ them and they didn’t listen. He correctly foresaw that there would be ‘mass disruption’ if Amorim and his very specific ideas and playing style arrived mid-season. He must have spent the subsequent 14 months p*ssing himself as that disruption continued unabated until and beyond the Portuguese manager’s demise.",
      "Ashworth wanted to ‘minimise upheaval’ after the squad had already had to adjust to a new backroom team under Ten Hag before being told to forget all that and to get used to a system most of them had never played before, with no time for adaptation and games coming thick as well as fast.",
      "Liverpool had considered Amorim but went for Slot as the Portuguese manager’s ‘three at the back and general philosophy jarred with the squad’. United made no such consideration having cared only about Amorim’s impressive ‘aura’.",
      "Ratcliffe wanted United to be ‘chest out and bold’ and was ‘desperate for charisma’. Little did he know that that’s apparently all Amorim had, and that it cannot counter well over a year of underperformance, even with hundreds of millions spent.",
      "Amorim told the club that he wanted to wait and join in the summer, but Berrada told him it was ‘now or never’. If offered the chance to choose again, both parties would definitely choose the latter.",
      "But ultimately the failure of Amorim can be tracked back to Ratcliffe and his peers in the boardroom. They rushed through appointing him in November 2024 and sacked him in January 2026, spending pretty much every intervening second trying to convince themselves publicly and privately that they had cracked it while actually writing off at least a couple of seasons and likely far more considering how so many of their decisions on the playing squad alone were inextricably tied to suiting the ideals of an obstinate head coach who is no longer there.",
      "Add it to the extensive personal list of Ratcliffe’s football ownership “cock-ups”. Someone get him a copy of Football Manager so he can get all this out of his system.",
      "",
      "Just as United were moving past Amorim and, for once, starting to build some positive momentum on the pitch, Sir Jim decided to go Farmer Jim by claiming the UK has been ‘colonised by immigrants’ while also taking aim at those receiving state support.",
      "“You can’t have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonised. It’s costing too much money.",
      "“The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn’t it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it’s 70 million. That’s 12 million people.”",
      "Except, it’s not. The Office for National Statistics estimates that the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. We can all make up numbers, fella.",
      "And if we’re talking about benefits, Brexit Jim has taken a few handouts himself, including a £120million public subsidy in December for INEOS, Ratcliffe’s company that holds £1.75billion in cash while he sits on an £11billion personal fortune.",
      "Maybe Ratcliffe lost track of the population figures for 2020 since it was the same year he quit the UK, moving his tax domicile to tax-free Monaco, saving himself an estimated £4billion.",
      "It is the ‘colonised by immigrants’ take that has caused most controversy, with even the Prime Minister taking an uncharacteristically decisive stance, calling for the billionaire to apologise. Arf.",
      "We’re still not sure what the question was that Ratcliffe was answering. He sat down with Sky News in Belgium to talk about the state of the chemicals sector. Ed Conway seemed genuinely astonished by Ratcliffe’s tone, described by Manchester mayor Andy Burnham as ‘insulting and inflammatory’.",
      "It hasn’t gone down well with United fans’ groups either, but very little of what Ratcliffe has done since getting into bed with the Glazers has been warmly received beyond the boardroom at Old Trafford.",
      "Many are asking what the foreigners in the dressing room might make of Ratcliffe’s views. Our guess: they probably won’t even notice. But that’s not who the words seem to be aimed at. They were a gift for Nigel Farage and those who see profit in sowing further division, and a betrayal of the socialist roots of a club Ratcliffe claimed to support before coming to see it as an investment vehicle.",

      "The former Celtic and Nottingham Forest boss exited Spurs at the end of last season, with their dire Premier League form deemed unacceptable despite their Europa League triumph.",
      "Frank was appointed to steady the ship, but they were arguably even worse during his tenure. He departed with them only five points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.",

      "“I saw that because when we tried to sign players, we were not in the market for those players. There are certain players… at the end of my first year when we finished fifth, we had to sign Premier League ready players to go from fifth to challenging.",
      "“But we didn’t qualify for the Champions League so we ended up signing Dominic Solanke, who I really liked, and three teenagers.",

When Arsenal need players, they will spend £100million on Declan Rice. I don’t see Tottenham doing that. When was the last time Tottenham signed someone and you went, ‘Wow’?”",

      "“Thomas is walking in… what’s his objective? What’s the club’s objective? At the start of the year they said they wanted to compete on all front, well the club hasn’t competed on all fronts for a very long time.",
      "“Also the most influential person at the club for the last 20 years is also going, so if you’re going to do such a major pivot, you’ve got to understand that there is going to be some instability there. Did Thomas know he was walking into that? It’s a curious club.",

      "Man City dropped points to Spurs recently so is that proof Pep is not very good and should be removed?",
      "In the same way it is absurd to think Carrick should be the next full time head coach after the first 4 wins, it’s equally absurd to say a draw away at an improved, well oiled team like West Ham is proof he’s not good enough. Every potential choice has pros and cons. We’ve also tried every possible type from the proven winners, to the club legend to the next big thing coach who did great in another league. None have reached the heights demanded/expected.",
      "Perhaps we should lower those expectations and realise at the very best, at this moment in time, they can only get Top 4 if everything goes to plan? Instead of always thinking the next manager is the Messiah who is going to bring the league title back, plan to be a top 4 team, THEN look at building towards the title – and this could be a change in manager.",
      "The other thing people keep forgetting is that INEOS have declared a wish to have a recruitment plan based around the club and not a manager (the signings made under Amorim already show this as any worries about being 3-4-3 players have been forgotten now they play 4-2-3-1) . This indicates (and reports have said Amorim got pissy over not having a say) that they want a head coach who doesn’t have a say in recruitment (final say on a player for example).",
      "This could very well be a Carrick or an Ole and not an Enrique or Tuchel. And as a fan, I just want to enjoy my club play football and under Carrick that is something I have done for the first time since Ole was in charge (apart from that 3-4 month period Rashford was flying during Ten Hag’s first season). Other fans will have different feelings and that is their right.",
      "So, lets just wait and see. Carrick could end up going on a huge losing run and be out of the running. Or he could get back to winning ways and get top 4 and champions league and for all we know, get hired and bring the title back. He has as much chance as others who all have cons.

There are no cups, no nothing left in this early disaster of a season, and the fact that if and when United do end up getting 5 wins in a row, it will get more hype than when City won the treble.

      "According to reports, Manchester United have missed out on Thomas Tuchel, who has decided to ‘sign a new contract’ to commit himself to England until 2028.",
      "Former Chelsea and Bayern Munich boss Tuchel has been mooted as a potential candidate to be Man Utd‘s next permanent boss in recent weeks.",
      "Tuchel is currently preparing for this summer’s World Cup as he will lead England, though it had been expected that he would step away upon the expiry of his current contract at the end of the tournament.",
      "This would have opened the door for Man Utd to appoint Tuchel ahead of next season, but this now appears to be off the table.",

      "‘Tuchel’s current deal was due to expire after the World Cup. Tuchel one of the names considered by Manchester United, but England boss has agreed to stay on.’",
      "After this extension was confirmed, Tuchel said: “I am very happy and proud to extend my time with England. It is no secret to anyone that I have loved every minute so far of working with my players and coaches, and I cannot wait to lead them to the World Cup. It is an incredible opportunity and we are going to do our very best to make the country proud.",

EURO 2028 will be a very special tournament and as a coach there is nothing more you want than to compete with the very best on the biggest possible stage.”",
      "This perhaps gives Man Utd interim boss Michael Carrick a greater chance of landing the job permanently.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Six clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so three times.",
      "The pressure has eased on West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo while Eddie Howe pushed Thomas Frank over the edge as he took his own step back, while duff results on Wednesday night have pushed Oliver Glasner and Fabian Hurzeler closer to the brink as the relegation fight becomes a battle royale, with Sean Dyche already defenestrated.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 13 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford didn’t dampen spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Nine wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 2024/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from three games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League with an eight-point lead over an unconvincing Liverpool in sixth, and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. It’s all still an astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… okay? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Lost four in a row after that, but did leave Nottingham Forest with a funny 0-0 draw after their hosts rained down 35 unsuccessful shots at Jose Sa’s goal. Should now beat Derby’s infamous 11-point record – they have nine points with a near guarantee of at least three more to come because they still have a game against Spurs in their locker – and after that Edwards’ primary role has always been about what happens next season rather than this.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "Completing the double over a Newcastle side that also chucked them all the money for Wissa is magnificent. That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, 10 points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, even more so.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory over Wolves and Everton.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "Has ruled himself out of Spurs contention as he has apparently set his sights higher. Ergo, an intelligent man.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, 2026 has seen another huge swing in Nuno’s fortunes. For neither the first nor last time, Tottenham came to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "Nuno and West Ham essentially relegated Burnley with a win at Turf Moor and suddenly, it’s not all so negative at the London Stadium where the delicious prospect grows of not only securing survival for themselves but relegating Tottenham in the process.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league. Smashing Nottingham Forest in a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer was huge and they are clearly more upwardly mobile right now than other teams around them in the table.",
      "Almost certainly not going down, and that is almost certainly enough for Farke.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool.",
      "The home defeat to Brentford confirms Newcastle’s slump back into mid-table and had Howe under some notable pressure before Dr Tottenham turned up with the usual cure.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "A fine run after the November international break pulled Silva back from the brink and Fulham clear of the relegation scrap, but they’ve now lost four of their last five in the Premier League.",
      "And with Spurs needing a manager, maybe some people think he will walk. We would strongly urge against it, but the lure of even a big club as tarnished as Spurs can be significant.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth.",
      "An impressive win over Newcastle eased the pressure, but that ludicrous conclusion to the Man City game puts Slot firmly back in the spotlight. A win at Sunderland in a midweek round where the mounting chaos on and off the pitch in the relegation fight has taken much of the focus was most welcome.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They have only one win in their last 14 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "A big storyline this season has been teams carelessly succumbing to The Drift and slipping out the back of the big mid-table gang and into real trouble.",
      "Bournemouth have done it but turned it round. Tottenham have done it and are still in deep sh*t. Palace have done it and are also still in bother despite beating Brighton who are suddenly on a 13-game Premier League run where their only win was against Burnley at home.",
      "Their next three league games are against high-flying Brentford, a six-pointer against Forest, and table-toppers Arsenal. Hmm.",
      "Thomas Frank is no longer manager of Tottenham Hotspur; but who will replace him in the job?",

      "Manchester United hair boy Frank Ilett is just a bit of fun, while Arne Slot is anything but as bad luck has struck.",
      "Watch the football on Wednesday night and mail theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Good lord, you lot need to crack a smile once in a while.",
      "I’ve just read your Football365/PlanetFootball piece on Frank Ilett. Firstly, I’m not even sure where one site ends and the other begins, but I digress. Anyway the tone is wildly overcooked for what’s basically a bloke making a spectacle of himself for a laugh and quick buck.",
      "The headline reads like someone’s died: ‘Man Utd fan’s viral haircut challenge is exposing modern society’s hollowness.’ Really?",
      "The gist seems to be: Frank is an attention-grabbing shill who’s made a quick quid off Manchester United’s general ineptitude, and that this is some heinous crime that debases “proper” football fans. Then there’s the sneering bit about the people who enjoy it being the kind who “openly admit they haven’t read a book in years.” For what it’s worth, I think it’s harmless fun and I’ve just finished reading Ulysses.",
      "And the “Big Business is ruining something that could have been spontaneous” handwringing doesn’t really hold up when the piece is published on sites owned by a major media group. If you’re happy to take their money, maybe ease off the moral panic about someone else cashing in on a viral gag.",
      "Football is light entertainment. It’s pantomime. That’s why it’s fun. It’s a distraction from work, kids, and our partners complaining the washing isn’t done right. Who cares if a silly man made a silly buck off the silliest big club in the country being spectacularly rubbish?",
      "Rant over.\nOliver, London",
      "(We don’t take money from a major media group so not quite sure what that means; we work for a medium-sized digital publishing company. And we reserve the right to be annoyed by hair boy just as you have the right to disagree – Ed)",
      "",
      "I’m so sick of haircut guy. But despite that, a feature I’d love to see: how long would the hair be of a haircut guy for each of the other teams in the prem? Like when did they last do five wins in a row? How much is this a Man U embarrassment or how much is in fact it really hard to win five in a row?\nR",
      "(Well, 11 Premier League clubs have done this since Man Utd last did – Ed)",
      "",
      "I’ve been doing a bit of research into Spurs and their issues over the past few years, and it seems to me that their problem is that they keep on hiring beleaguered managers.",
      "Reckon if they get someone in who isn’t beleaguered then they should be OK.\nMatt",
      "",
      "Football fans don’t normally look through things with the clearest of eyes considering the primal nature it brings out in all of us, so the calls for Slot to be sacked are not surprising despite still being absolutely premature.",
      "The wonder Slot performed last season was always heightened by the fact that he signed no one after taking the reins and won the league with the same squad as he inherited from Klopp (Chiesa doesn’t count, we know that).",
      "Fast forward to this season after a huge summer outlay and people are using the reverse argument – tons spent and doing worse. Surely a sackable offense. But people are (conveniently when you’re an opposition supporter) forgetting he took in around 250m from player sales from Diaz, Nunez, Quansah, Kelleher etc and also lost another 100mil plus in market value in Trent and the tragic death of Jota.",
      "Slot replaced each loss with the exception of Diaz so by my count they have a smaller core squad than they did at the start of last season. Add to that fact the injuries they’ve had:",
      "Salah gone at AFCON.",
      "Isak has played total 400 or so minutes and is on his 3rd spell out",
      "Right-back slot is cursed for injuries by Trent leaving sort of like when Voldemort was refused the defence against the dark arts job at Hogwarts.",
      "Then Macca, Ekitike, Gakpo and Allison have all had their spells on the sidelines.",
      "Also I don’t believe in any conspiracies but Liverpool’s luck this season with decisions is something that makes me wonder about unseen forces like Jedi power. Look at some of the games they’ve dropped points in:",
      "Palace – this is the game that started the rot after the great start. Palace score from a corner that was never a corner for their first. I get it, it was hard for the ref to see so let’s just chalk it off as bad luck. Palace then score the winner with the clock at 96:59 when there was 6 mins added time – how in **** was that possible. But yea OK just one of those days where both the opposition goals shouldn’t have stood.",
      "Utd – second game after Palace and their opening goal should never have happened as Macca had a head injury and ended up needing 4 stitches but yea just bad luck the ref never blew like he’s meant to. Just one of those days. Liverpool proceed to be far better for the rest of the game missing sitters and slab head wins it against the run of play.",
      "Brentford – very next game in the league and Brentford get given the most dubious penalty ive ever seen. The one where literally no Brentford player was looking for it and the VAR had to guess whether or not a foul by VVD was on the penalty box line, which of course they guessed it was. Brentford win by 1.",
      "Guess what game comes two matches after? The loss to City. We all know pool were being out played but we all know VVD had a perfectly good goal disallowed to level it.",
      "And sure let’s go straight to the game at the wknd against City where Guehi should have seen red….or at least very possibly could have.",
      "Point is when it is ‘could’ and not absolutely ‘should’ – these have went the oppositions way 100% of the time this season and more often than not decided the outcome.",
      "Lastly – individual errors. For all the rotten luck with ref calls and injuries, Liverpool have made some insane individual errors this season. Earlier it was Konate and Kerkez, both of whom have kind of cut that out (especially Kerkez who has been great lately). But VVD and Allison are weighing in with their own as well. Whats more, they get punished with a goal it seems on every single error. They get away with nothing",
      "My point is – none of the above is Slot’s fault. Maybe the individual errors if an argument is to be made that his tactics are putting players in bad spots but I don’t personally buy it. The performances lately have deserved far more point than they have received. Slot can’t force Ekitike to stop missing headers, although he can stop playing Gakpo who is a level of useless I don’t think I’ve ever seen before in a red shirt.",
      "Oh yea – opposition score with their first chance of the game pretty much 100% of the time.",
      "God I hope the new manager bounce is now over for Chelsea and Utd.\nPatricio Del Toro (I’ve half typed out this ranty email about 3 times this season but I can’t bottle it up any longer, please God, Arsenal, beat City to the league)",
      "",
      "…While I’m completely in agreement that Slot hasn’t done well enough this season I’m unsure if a lot of the recent criticism stacks up.",
      "1. Playing your best midfielder as a defender shows you don’t care about results. Despite being a bit hyperbolic – I’m sure no manager doesn’t care about results – it’s not mad to see a CM playing at fullback. City and Arsenal have both done it to great effect in recent seasons. Trent was in many ways more of a midfielder for us than a pure defender and having someone with a similar range of passing and licence to drift infield makes a lot of sense tactically, especially when our first two choices at RB are out.",
      "2. Moving away from focus on Salah is a mistake. He’s 33 and we have to move on from him some time. Surely now is the time to start putting that in place? Just waiting until he leaves and then hoping to somehow replace a top 5 PL player of all time isn’t exactly a better option, surely? That will have been agreed across the whole leadership group, not as Slot selling bullshit to the board.",
      "3. Slot doesn’t trust youth. This is basically because he’s sold Morton, Quansah and Elliott and isn’t starting Rio despite Gakpo’s form.\nMorton is doing well for the team in 3rd in Ligue Un, but he’s not realistically going to start ahead of Grav or Macca and didn’t want to stay to be on the bench at his age Elliott isn’t going to be ahead of Sbo or Wirtz and also wanted the opportunity for game time and Quansah wasn’t going to be ahead of Ibou or VVD and also wanted game time – he was replaced by Leoni who looked great before doing his knee and would doubtless have played more this season had he been fit.",
      "I get that everyone wants Rio to play more, with people saying he should be coming in when we’re leading comfortably – the issue is that has barely happened this season. When he’s started he’s been ok but he’s just turned 17 and isn’t going to be running games at that age.",
      "4. He only won the league because of Klopp. The obvious question is why didn’t Klopp win the league the season he left then? Slot changed the tactics around the positioning of Grav and Salah which allowed them to both have their best seasons for us while also making us a lot more solid at the back than we had been for a while. Of the 41 goals we conceded (same as Klopp’s last season) 9 were in the final four games after we’d won the league. Before then we were on for our best season since 21/22.",
      "We haven’t been good enough this season for a number of reasons (fitness, second balls, set pieces, integration of new players as a start) and I expect that Slot will go at the end of the season, but some of the statements have been more driven by dislike of him as a person (because results are bad) than anything else.\nTom, Andover (watch us lose to Sunderland in the 95th minute this time)",
      "",
      "Perhaps the most Everton game of the season.",
      "Good grief.\nAidan, EFC, Hoxton",
      "",
      "I read with interest that one contributor wrote today that Casemiro’s offside was correct, even if it was just by the width of a kneecap. What people are perhaps missing is that even in this high tech modern world we might not be getting as accurate a picture as we have assumed we are.",
      "A modern TV broadcasters camera will record at 50fps (frames per second) which means there 0.02 seconds between each image the camera catches. In that time a premier league player travelling at 8 or 9 metres per second could travel about 16cm. This means that if the camera is paused just one frame too late, (and remember there are 50 frames each second so this is probably preety likely) the resulting position of the player could be up to 16cm out of his true position when the ball was played. That is far more than the distance of one kneecap",
      "I’m not suggesting we should expect perfection but rather that, if imperfection isnt actually guaranteed we ought to do away with VAR for offside decisions and go back to trusting/shouting at the linesman. There is just as much speculation about decisions as there was before but in the meantime, it ruins the flow of the game and we are objectively not getting a better spectacle. It isn’t producing more scientifically accurate decisions and it’s just shit. I do believe we should keep the hawkeye technology for goalline decisions and VAR can hang around too to check serious fouls and stuff but it hasn’t improved the enjoyment of the game in any way and at the end of the day, this is an entertainment industry. So please F365, start a serious campaign to remove this inaccurate stain from our game.",
      "I believe in you F365, do you believe in yourself?\nWarren",
      "",
      "If I was the PL Chairman and board I’d be very, very concerned with the trajectory of the PL. It’s noticeable the number of empty seats at PL grounds. In an economy were fixed costs, rent, council tax, food, fuel keeps on rising against limited budgets; there is little bandwidth for fans to pay Club prices.",
      "Many clubs openly reject the season ticket holder in favour of the tourist, people who will spend large sums in the club shop and in house food and beverages. It’s a model fraught with danger as they lose their hardcore support and a generation of youngsters who’s free time is fought for amongst a myriad of games platforms, social media sites and other activities.",
      "The quality of football is turgid as corners, long throws are now weapon of choice against the 5-4-1 the defences. The rise in IPTV sticks shows there’s appetite at the value level but the game needs a shot in the arm.",
      "We need more reward and jeopardy in the game if it’s to survive. We need reward for goals and attacking play. How we do that is up for discussion, but 3 points for a win and 1 for a draw is long overdue change.",
      "What that looks like I’ll leave others to suggest.\nP. Didi (not)"

      "Thursday 12 February 2026 16:50, UK",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe says he is \"sorry that my choice of language has offended some people\" after claiming Britain has been \"colonised\" by immigrants who are draining resources from the state.",
      "In an interview with Sky News, Ratcliffe, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group, warned Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years.",
      "\"You can't have an economy with nine-million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.",
      "\"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58m in 2020, now it's 70m. That's 12m people.\"",
      "However, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates the population of the UK was 67m in mid-2020 and 70m in mid-2024. The UK population was estimated at 58.9m in 2000.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, Ratcliffe said: \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.",
      "\"My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.",
      "\"My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK.\"",
      "In the wake of Ratcliffe's apology, United released a statement saying the club \"prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club\" before noting that \"equality, diversity and inclusion\" has been embedded into everything the club does.",
      "Without mentioning Ratcliffe by name, the Old Trafford club said:",
      "\"Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters reflect the history and heritage of Manchester, a city that anyone can call home.",
      "\"Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.\"We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\"",
      "The FA is understood to be looking into Ratcliffe's comments. English football's governing body will assess Ratcliffe's interview with Sky News to ascertain if his comments breached FA regulations.",
      "Should the FA choose to formally investigate, the probe may be focused on FA Rule E3.1, which covers general behaviour.",
      "The rule states: \"A participant shall at all times act in the best interests of the game and shall not act in any manner which is improper or brings the game into disrepute or use any one, or a combination of, violent conduct, serious foul play, threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting words or behaviour.\"",

      "Ratcliffe, as a club co-owner, is subject to FA rules as a participant.",
      "Ratcliffe - who is a resident of Monaco - also signalled Prime Minister Keir Starmer might not be the right person for the job, saying: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or he's maybe too nice. I mean, Keir is a nice man.",
      "\"I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\"",
      "Ratcliffe said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, the leader of right-wing party Reform UK, saying: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man and I think he's got good intentions.",
      "\"But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\"",
      "Referring to his role at United, Ratcliffe added: \"I've seen quite a bit of this at the football club. If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while.\"",
      "Ratcliffe continued: \"I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes. But for the better, in my view. I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off.",

      "In an interview with Sky News's Ed Conway, Sir Jim Ratcliffe says Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years; Warning: Please be aware the language below could cause offence",
      "By Ed Conway, Sky News' economics and data editor",
      "Thursday 12 February 2026 13:42, UK",
      "Britain has been \"colonised\" by immigrants, who are draining resources from the state, Manchester United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has told Sky News.",
      "Ratcliffe, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group, warned Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years.",
      "\"You can't have an economy with nine-million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.",
      "\"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"",
      "However, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. The UK population was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000.",
      "Ratcliffe - who is a resident of Monaco - also signalled Prime Minister Keir Starmer might not be the right person for the job, saying: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or he's maybe too nice. I mean, Keir is a nice man.",
      "\"I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\"",
      "Ratcliffe said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, the leader of right-wing party Reform UK, saying: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man and I think he's got good intentions.",
      "\"But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\"",
      "Referring to his role at United, Ratcliffe added: \"I've seen quite a bit of this at the football club. If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while.\"",
      "Ratcliffe continued: \"I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes. But for the better, in my view. I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off.",
      "\"But you've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular and show some courage.\"",

      "Michael Carrick's unbeaten start to life as Man Utd head coach won't see the club accelerate their plans moving forward; Carrick has won four of his opening five games in charge; should United secure Champions League qualification, Carrick may become a frontrunner for the job",
      "Wednesday 11 February 2026 19:28, UK",
      "They may not have gotten the result they wanted against West Ham, but Manchester United remain unbeaten in Michael Carrick's five games in charge. Under his stewardship, the team has beaten Arsenal and Manchester City already.",
      "Nevertheless, the club's bosses will not accelerate their plans to appoint a new head coach, and Carrick is still not the favourite to be the next long-term boss at Old Trafford.",
      "To understand why, you need to drill down into the new, determined philosophy at the heart of the club.",
      "United will make no decision about the top job right now. As Gary Neville suggested, the hierarchy has begun the process of identifying possible targets. But it has been made clear to me they have not yet spoken to any candidates, and they will wait until the end of the season before progressing with an appointment.",
      "In Carrick (and in Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Trevor Binnion and Jonny Evans) the team is in very good hands, and so that has placated the bosses into feeling there is no rush to make the next decision.",
      "Yes, there is a growing clamour from some supporters - and some pundits - for Carrick to be given the job right now. He is handling the media consummately. The mood is high. The players are happy, and enjoy training. The team is performing very well. Results are well and truly on the up.",
      "But to commit to a long-term appointment now would go against everything that United are determined their operation should be: calm, considered, strategic. There will be no short-term fixes, and certainly no decisions as important as the next head coach, made on the limited evidence of just five games.",
      "The same resolute, methodical policy was there for all to see with United's January transfer activity. Despite Ruben Amorim bemoaning his injury problems, AFCON absentees and a lack of squad depth, not one single player was signed as \"cover\" in the January transfer window. And there were no new incomings either once Carrick took charge. United are keeping their powder dry - and their transfer kitty full - for a central midfield transfer onslaught in the summer. That's the plan, and they're sticking to it.",
      "Back to the head coach. Certainly, the bosses are delighted with the job Carrick is doing, and with the dynamic between the key members of his coaching staff. And if he continues to do well - and especially if he delivers Champions League football - he will certainly be one of the front runners come the summer. Such are the standards that he has set, and the impression that he has made that, even if he misses out on the job at Old Trafford, he can only have enhanced his reputation, and his chances of getting another Premier League manager's role, in the future.",
      "Ironically, if Carrick does deliver Champions League qualification over the final 12 games, he may inadvertently stiffen the competition he will face for the top job that. The United manager's role does not have the same appeal now that it had in the years immediately after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure. But United playing again in the top European club competition, with the big boost in the finances to boot? That may make the job much more attractive to some of the elite managers in world football.",
      "To that end, it's been made clear to me that United are determined to appoint someone who has the strength of character and experience to cope with all that is thrown at you as the main man at Old Trafford.",
      "The feeling among the hierarchy is that the job was too big for Amorim. He was surprised by the sheer noise which came with the role. That wasn't the case with his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, but there have been learnings from his tenure too. On both occasions, United felt they'd achieved a coup in recruiting the brightest manager in Europe of that particular era. Neither was a success at Manchester United.",
      "That sort of candidate is not on the wanted list this time. If it isn't Carrick, it is very likely to be one of the biggest names in world football - assuming United can persuade that man to join.",
      "The likes of Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti have the wow factor, the stellar name, the track record of winning multiple major trophies. Carrick can't compete with them on that level, but he out-scores them both when it comes to knowing Old Trafford, and the \"Manchester United way\".",
      "Carrick will happily work within the current United structure, which isn't about to change. Might Tuchel or Ancelotti want more of a say in transfer dealings, for example, than Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada are prepared to give? We should not forget that United's recent managerial past includes some huge football names. Neither Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal were considered a success. That is a lingering memory.",
      "Carrick has made a sensational start to his time as Manchester United head coach. Whether he gets the chance to continue the role beyond the summer has much to do with how the team performs under his charge between now and May - but also on the basis of many, many more factors.",
      "Whatever happens, United's bosses will not make a quick decision.",

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 21:42, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's impressive return to the Manchester United team shows what Ruben Amorim was missing. Also in The Debrief: More Bruno Fernandes numbers, Bernardo Silva's influential display, Enzo Fernandez's 'new' position and Angel Gomes' debut",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 20:59, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Gary Neville on Man Utd potentially appointing Michael Carrick: \"What United have said is they're not going to be bounced into, irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months, making an appointment. They're going to wait until the end of the season\"",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 15:10, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",
