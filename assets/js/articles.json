      "De Zerbi has left Marseille after the weekend's defeat to PSG(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Roberto De Zerbi has left Marseille after the 5-0 mauling at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. The Italian was reportedly close to leaving the club last month, having reportedly handed in his resignation just days before the transfer window closed.",
      "But De Zerbi has now actually left, with his final match in charge coming in the form of the thumping at the hands of the Ligue 1 champions on Sunday.",
      "A statement from Marseille on Wednesday read: “Olympique de Marseille and Roberto De Zerbi, coach of the first team, announce the end of their collaboration by mutual agreement. Following discussions involving all stakeholders in the club's management – owner, president, director of football, and coach – it was decided to opt for a change at the helm of the first team.",
      "“This was a difficult, collective decision, reached after careful consideration and in the best interests of the club to address the sporting challenges of the final stretch of the season.",
      "“Olympique de Marseille would like to thank Roberto De Zerbi for his investment, commitment, professionalism and seriousness, marked in particular by the 2nd place obtained during the 2024/25 season. The club wishes him all the best for the rest of his career.”",

      "De Zerbi was appointed by Marseille in 2024 following an impressive spell with Brighton. He leaves the club fourth in Ligue 1 but already 12 points behind leaders PSG.",
      "The Italian’s exit comes amid links with a number of Premier League clubs. He has been consistently linked with the role at Tottenham Hotspur, with the pressure continuing to rise on Thomas Frank.",
      "Former Manchester United star Jaap Stam has also suggested that he would be an ideal next appointment for the Red Devils. Speaking recently, he said: \"I like De Zerbi very much, you know, because of how he performed at Brighton and also now in Marseille.",

      "Man Utd boss Michael Carrick after the 1-1 draw with West Ham",
      "Michael Carrick hailed Leny Yoro's exceptional one-on-one defending, which allowed Manchester United to snatch a crucial draw at West Ham. The Red Devils' winning run ended at four matches, but were able to earn a point after Benjamin Sesko's 96th minute equaliser.",
      "Yoro was brought on to replace Harry Maguire at the same time as Sesko came on for Matheus Cunha, with a quarter of the match left at the London Stadium. Despite West Ham having several glorious chances to extend their lead, 20-year-old Yoro made two critical blocks to keep his side in contention.",
      "This marked the first time Yoro had seen action during Carrick's five-match tenure, but his contributions were pivotal when Sesko's superb strike secured the point that extended the unbeaten streak.",
      "MAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "Carrick threw attacking bodies onto the pitch in order to rescue a point and singled out Yoro's ability to stop breakaways as a vital contributor to the result.",
      "\"He deserves a lot of credit for that, to give us the chance to then go and get the goal that got something out of the game. We had moments, Josh had a chance, obviously Casemiro had the [disallowed goal], which I've not seen, but must have been close and then big moment for Ben. We had to go for it, we had to try and get something out of the game.\"",

      "\"Mixed feelings, we know we weren't quite at our best, I think credit to West Ham, a little bit of closing certain spaces up, but I think we can be better, the boys are a bit frustrated and disappointed with that, which is a really good sign for me,\" he said.",
      "\"Then finishing with a late goal when we've had to find one is a good moment and another positive for us to know that we can do that. We don't want to have to pull on it and use it too often but I think in the grand scheme I think there's points we can take and we kind of dust ourselves down a little bit, assess it, take these games over a five game period and to just have one draw in there I think is a big positive so mixed feelings really.\"",

      "The 20-year-old's turnaround has been stark. Before Carrick's arrival, Mainoo not only didn't start a single Premier League game under Amorim, but he was reportedly set to go out on loan for the rest of the season.",
      "The midfielder was linked with a move to Napoli, with Antonio Conte said to be interested in taking the England star to Italy where he would have reunited with former United team-mate Scott McTominay.",
      "Several Premier League teams including Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton all reportedly had interest in signing Mainoo before that opportunity was slammed shut upon his return to the starting line-up. According to The Telegraph, \"genuine disbelief\" existed in Naples due to United's apparent willingness to part ways with Mainoo.",
      "Those feelings were said to be shared by \"many Premier League clubs\" before Mainoo was told, due to Carrick's appointment, that he would return to the first team in a more prominent role.",
      "The 28-year-old is currently enjoying life at Barcelona and previously admitted that he wishes to remain in Catalonia past the summer. The La Liga giants have the option to buy Rashford - who has scored and assisted 23 goals this season - for £26million, which they're believed to be keen on activating.",

      "Benjamin Sesko earned Man Utd a late, late point at West Ham",
      "The wait for Manchester United goes on. But at least they salvaged a point with Benjamin Sesko’s 96th minute leveller which was straight out of the Fergie time play book.",
      "It broke West Ham hearts and could not actually provide the fifth straight win which United have waited so long for. No-one went home happy. However, West Ham are showing signs of life and fight even if they could not see this one out for the precious three points they needed.",
      "They did, however, stop United winning five games in a row for the first time in two years on a rollercoaster night of emotions. The long-suffering travelling United fans have seen such an improvement under Carrick and he has put in one hell of an audition to get the job on a permanent basis.",
      "But this was also about West Ham scrapping and fighting as Nuno Espirito Santo has really begun to give the fans hope. They had to weather long spells of United pressure but West Ham refused to buckle on a grey, misty night at the London Stadium.",
      "MAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "United went close after 22 minutes when Bruno Fernandes ’ 22nd minute corner found Luke Shaw in the box and the United defender’s shot was cleared off the line by Aaron Wan-Bissaka.",
      "It felt like this game was going nowhere. It was drab, uneventful and you can bet England boss Thomas Tuchel probably felt like he had wasted a night as he was sat up in the stands.",
      "But, at long last, West Ham are showing signs of fight and their opening goal was testament to teamwork. Jarrod Bowen was so clever as the West Ham captain battled and held off Shaw to create space for Tomas Soucek to ping the ball forward.",
      "Tomas Soucek thought he has scored the winner for West Ham(Image: West Ham United FC/West Ham United FC via Getty Images)",
      "Bowen scampered down the right wing, sent over a low cross and there was Soucek in the six yard box to turn the ball home from close range in the 50th minute.",
      "That brought the stadium to life and even the mood in the place has changed because the home fans can sense fresh optimism and genuine hope for survival.",
      "There was another big reason for West Ham fans to celebrate after Casemiro headed in what looked to be an equaliser but it was ruled out by VAR as the United midfielder was clearly offside.",
      "United threw on a raft of substitutes - including Sesko - as they fought desperately for a leveller and Joshua Zirkzee came as close as anyone as he glanced just wide. That had Carrick on his toes on the touchline.",
      "Seven minutes of added time were ticking down when United launched yet another attack - and this time it finally worked. Then just when it looked as if West Ham would get the points, Bryan Mbeumo’s ball was turned in with a looping shot from Sesko.",

      "Benjamin Sesko's 96th-minute equaliser broke West Ham hearts and rescued a 1-1 draw for Manchester United. Tomas Soucek's second-half strike looked to have made the difference, and a victory would've taken Nuno Espirito Santo's men within three goals of escaping the relegation zone.",
      "But Sesko, having come off the bench, came up with a magnificent finish to convert Bryan Mbeumo's cross and salvage a point. Michael Carrick had returned to his former club looking to make it five wins in a row, but despite the draw, he got some more late joy to keep the Red Devils in the top four.",
      "Here are five talking points from the London Stadium.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "If you missed the opening 45 minutes, you didn't miss much. Pedestrian football from both sides meant that chances were few and far between, with Senne Lammens having the most work to do of the goalkeepers when he palmed away a decent effort from the in-form Crysencio Summerville.",
      "The visitors went closest, though, as Aaron Wan-Bissaka blocked Luke Shaw's effort on the line after another well-worked corner routine by Carrick's side. They had more of the possession but rarely kept it in the final third, allowing West Ham to constantly get bodies back.",
      "To illustrate the lack of goalmouth action, the teams only generated a combined 0.28 expected goals. It was comfortably the worst half of Carrick's short reign up to that point.",
      "BACK THE MIRROR! Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search",
      "Michael Carrick had some thinking to do at the break(Image: Ian Kington/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "But was this about to be an even worse half for Carrick? After Luke Shaw hesistated and allowed on a punt forward to bounce, Jarrod Bowen won the ball and laid it off to Soucek.",
      "The Czech had time and space to give it back to Bowen, who burst away down the right flank as claret shirts flooded the box. After a low cross, Soucek was there to tap home, completing a lovely move with his team-mate and finally giving those inside the London Stadium a reason to make some noise.",
      "It was Soucek's third goal against the Red Devils, having also netted at Old Trafford last season. The midfielder's strike also makes him the highest-scoring Czech player in Premier League history, surpassing Patrick Berger.",
      "Tomas Soucek combined with Jarrod Bowen to score(Image: West Ham United FC/West Ham United FC via Getty Images)",
      "The Red Devils responded well to West Ham's opener and looked to be level just after the hour mark. Kobbie Mainoo produced a superb cross to find Casemiro charging into the penalty area and he coolly headed home past Mads Hermansen, edging in front of Wan-Bissaka.",
      "But from Casemiro's reaction, he knew what was coming. A VAR check confirmed the offside and remained 1-0 going into the closing stages.",
      "Casemiro looked to have equalised with a header(Image: Izzy Poles - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "By no means an outcast under Ruben Amorim, Harry Maguire's return from injury coincided with Carrick's appointment and has given him a new lease of life. Imperious for much of the last five games, there was a moment of worry in the first half when the 32-year-old went into a tackle and came out clutching his hamstring.",
      "Maguire was able to continue until being subbed in the 68th minute alongside Matheus Cunha, who'd been ineffective, and he was seen talking to staff. Leny Yoro and Benjamin Sesko were sent on while Nuno also made a change, as Callum Wilson replaced Valentin Castellanos.",
      "Harry Maguire was feeling his hamstring in the first half(Image: James Fearn/Getty Images)",
      "After coming up with the winner against Fulham two games ago, Sesko was the Red Devils' saviour again - and this time in style. As Carrick threw the kitchen sink at it, West Ham had multiple chances to finish the game off.",
      "And the Irons were left to rue their careless finishing when Sesko met Mbeumo's cross at the near post and found the top right-hand corner. Carrick's winning run is over but the honeymoon period might just continue in nearly a fortnight's time at Everton.",

The 'United Strand' was hoping that his 493-day challenge would finally come to an end on Tuesday evening, with just one win remaining on the Red Devils' part.",

While Benjamin Sesko levelled the match six minutes into stoppage time, it was a case of too little, too late for United, who walked away from the London Stadium sharing the points with the Hammers.",

      "Michael Carrick has put his trust in Harry Maguire(Image: Shaun Brooks - CameraSport, CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Harry Maguire appears highly likely to secure a new deal with Manchester United in the coming months, as Michael Carrick continues to instil faith in the centre-back. The England international will be 33 when his existing agreement expires this summer, as he approaches the latter stages of his career.",
      "Given that he's understood to currently earn approximately £180,000-per-week in wages, United may seek to reduce his salary as they attempt to reach an arrangement with him. The club will also need to negotiate with his representatives regarding the duration of his new deal.",
      "The England international has proved integral to Carrick's system at Old Trafford and now looks set to have his tenure prolonged following his impressive displays in recent weeks. The Daily Mail report Maguire's representatives held discussions with AC Milan in January, though the player wishes to remain and appears likely to pen new terms.",
      "Maguire has featured in every one of Carrick's matches since taking charge of United last month, partnering alongside Lisandro Martinez in victories over Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham.",
      "Should Maguire finalise a new agreement with his club of seven years, it would represent a remarkable turnaround from the situation he encountered just a number of years ago, having been relieved of his captaincy by Erik ten Hag before drifting in and out of Ruben Amorim's starting XI.",
      "Maguire's situation differs from that of team-mate Casemiro, who has confirmed he will leave Manchester United when his contract runs out this summer. The Brazilian holding midfielder has flourished at the Theatre of Dreams since joining from Real Madrid in 2022, clocking up 149 appearances in the heart of the engine room.",
      "Nevertheless, the 33-year-old revealed earlier this year that he will be departing the Reds this summer. Taking to Instagram to share the poignant announcement, he wrote: \"Knowing when stages come to an end.",

      "\"Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever. Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal.",
      "\"Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "The move came despite Casemiro possessing a contract extension option in his existing agreement, triggered should he feature in 35 matches or more this campaign. Both Casemiro and Maguire will be aiming to secure a fifth consecutive victory under Carrick on Tuesday evening, as the Reds head to the London Stadium to face a rejuvenated West Ham United.",

      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is not yet convinced by Jadon Sancho(Image: David Horton/Getty Images)",
      "Jadon Sancho is playing for his future at Aston Villa because Unai Emery remains undecided whether to sign the Manchester United winger permanently. Sancho in on loan from United with Villa and has enjoyed a decent period of form of late.",
      "The 25-year-old began the season as part of the bomb squad at United, with Ruben Amorim freezing out Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony. Villa decided to sign him on a season-long loan deal in the hope he could repeat his form at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "That did not materialise in the early stages of the season, with zero goals or assists coming until January 22, when Sancho broke his duck by scoring in a 1-0 win over Fenerbahce. He then assisted Morgan Rogers in the 1-1 draw against Bournemouth on the weekend, prompting reporters to ask Emery about Sancho's future.",
      "The Villa boss said he \"expects more\" from Sancho after the draw against Bournemouth. And speaking ahead of Villa's Premier League game against Brighton on Wednesday, Emery said he remained undecided on a permanent transfer for Sancho in the summer.",

      "“Not yet (not decided). But he’s a fantastic player,” he said. \"He will need another contract and maybe it could be here. In case he’s playing his best football, we will want him. Maybe other teams could be involved in the interest for him.\"",
      "Emery added: “The first part of the season was not enough. He was working, he was trying, but he was not achieving the performances needed. I spoke to him a few times about the challenge he has and he must be very demanding in himself, like he is now.",
      "\"There’s no time to wait for anyone. We need everyone to be focused, with their qualities and preparation to play helping the team. We believed in him at the start of season, we believed in him in December and we believe in him now and I believe he’s getting better.”",

      "Speaking on the weekend, Emery said: \"Hopefully he is getting better and he can help us in this process like he is, getting better. I expect more from him, and because I am positive, hopefully he will give us it.\"",
      "Sancho's contract with United expires at the end of the season, meaning his future almost certainly lies away from Old Trafford. His £73million move from Dortmund to United in the summer of 2021 did not work out, with the club getting just 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for their money.",
      "He has spent recent seasons away on loan with Dortmund, Chelsea and Villa. Chelsea ended up paying United £5m last summer so they didn't have to go through with a £25m deal to sign him permanently and his future is once again in the balance.",

      "The United interim manager has changed the formation from Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1 to a more simplistic 4-2-3-1 and has reaped the benefits. United have beaten Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham to turn around their fortunes and solidify fourth place in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick has stuck with a settled side, using Kobbie Mainoo in midfield alongside Casemiro and allowing Bruno Fernandes to play as a No.10. Maguire has re-established his partnership with Lisandro Martinez in central defence and is delighted with the upturn in form.",
      "He believes that the defensive structure and organisation that Carrick has drilled into the players has made all the difference as they go in search of their fifth straight win against West Ham on Tuesday night.",

      "\"He's been brilliant. We know what Kobbie can do - he can take the ball under pressure, he's brilliant on the ball, he can get out of tight spaces. I always say as a footballer, when the structure is good, you can perform and be a good player. But the structure has got to be good all around you. I think we've seen with Cassy (Casemiro) too in the last few games, when the structure is good he's still a magnificent centre midfielder.\"",
      "United sometimes struggled in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation, with players not comfortable in unfamiliar positions. Carrick has made a point of placing players in their natural positions and that has helped United find solidity, according to Maguire.",

Against Man City, we took the lead and were happy to soak up a little bit of pressure and to be comfortable defending our box.",
      "\"I think that's the main thing that's improved over the past three games: we've defended our box a lot better with a lot more urgency. Previously, we defended our box nowhere near good enough. Every time the ball went into the box, they had a chance.",
      "\"But the last three games, loads more urgency - and not just from the defenders, from the midfielders and the wide men getting back in and the striker protecting the edge of the box. It's so important that we do it as a team and we've got to make sure we get the spaces right and that we're compact all over the pitch.",
      "\"Michael will bring that. There will be times where you'll see us go man to man all over the pitch and try to be really aggressive and there will also be times where we're happy and content in keeping the spaces short and punishing teams on the counter-attack. I think it's important to be tactically flexible in that aspect.\"",

      "Gary Lineker has predicted Marcus Rashford will play a prominent role for England at World Cup 2026 amid rumours of a Manchester United comeback(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Gary Lineker has predicted Marcus Rashford deserves a starting spot in England's XI at this year's World Cup. The former Match of the Day host made the assertion while addressing speculation surrounding Rashford's future at Manchester United.",
      "Reports have surfaced suggesting interim United manager Michael Carrick is keen to bring the forward back to Old Trafford following the conclusion of his loan at Barcelona. However, it's believed Rashford is hesitant about returning to his boyhood club, where he hasn't featured since December 2024.",
      "Speaking to Spanish football expert Alex Aljoe on The Rest Is Football, Lineker praised Rashford for his latest Barcelona performance. The Englishman was in the starting line-up as the Blaugrana demolished Mallorca 3-0 on Saturday, with Robert Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal and Marc Bernal providing the goals.",
      "\"I want to start with someone who didn't score but got a lot of plaudits, and that's Marcus Rashford,\" he said. \"Because he's been in the news a little bit, that there's a rumour that Michael Carrick wants Rashford to go back.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"And the rumour was that he actually doesn't want to go back. He's pretty happy. I saw a post this morning saying, 'Well played, Marcus. What a performance.' If you look at England [and] who plays on the left for England. I think at the moment, Rashford's miles ahead.\"",
      "Anthony Gordon was put forward as another option, with the Newcastle ace poised to compete for Thomas Tuchel's left wing position. Morgan Rogers and Noni Madueke might also be viewed as contenders for that berth, but Lineker reckons Rashford holds the advantage.",
      "\"Rashford's been really, really good,\" he added. \"And of course, it's a big advantage the way they play in Spain, that it's not so physically demanding. That come the World Cup, he won't be knackered like most of the players playing in the Premier League [laughs].\"",
      "Lineker continues to be impressed by Rashford's exploits at Barcelona(Image: The Rest Is Football)",
      "His most recent appearance in La Liga ended Rashford's run of finding the net in consecutive matches. He delivered the club's consolation goal in a 2-1 loss to Real Sociedad last month before scoring in a 3-1 triumph at Elche.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted 10 goals and registered 13 assists in 34 appearances for Barca in all competitions. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether Hansi Flick has been persuaded to activate the permanent clause to acquire the player for roughly £26million as of yet.",
      "Should Barcelona decline to exercise the buy option, Rashford will head back to Manchester in comparable circumstances to last summer. However, the crucial distinction is that it might be Carrick, rather than Ruben Amorim, making the decisions this time round.",

      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Having previously called Rashford his team-mate, Carrick might possess the expertise required to persuade the player he has a future back at the Theatre of Dreams. Yet Rashford's remarks indicate he may be keen to move on.",
      "Regardless, his spell at the Camp Nou has demonstrated at least the quality he is still capable of producing at the highest level. And should Barca opt against securing his signature permanently, his period in the spotlight may well persuade another club to launch a bid.",

      "With many domestic seasons in full tilt, there will be players cruelly axed from the biggest ever World Cup in North America due to injuries and lack of form. And the play-offs in March provide further jeopardy for more high-profile stars who could potentially miss out on the 48-team tournament.",
      "Here's a look at some of the biggest stars who risk missing out on the tournament, or have already missed their chance to book tickets for the World Cup.",
      "Neymar has been lauded as one of the best players of his generation, and for good reason. The forward could light up a game with the sort of trickery that has become well associated with the top stars coming out of Brazil.",
      "However, now at 34 years of age, there is growing uncertainty over his place in the national team ahead of what could be his final World Cup. Neymar has been struggling with injury issues over the past few seasons, and while a return to Santos came with the hope of rebounding, it hasn't quite had that effect - yet.",
      "Carlo Ancelotti has made it clear that he won't be carrying players through the tournament, however, as the barrage of questions over the star's possible inclusion in the squad continue. It means Neymar has an uphill battle to be among those on the plane to the World Cup this summer, just 12 years on from making his bow in his home tournament.",

      "Alexander Isak faces a race to get back fit and firing in time, after picking up a serious leg injury. Meanwhile, other high-profile teammates such as Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres and injured Tottenham forward Dejan Kulusevski also face the possibility of not going to the World Cup, unless their form changes dramatically.",
      "Cameroon missed out on qualifying for the World Cup, after a surprise exit from QAF qualifiers. The African nation have featured at six World Cups, with a quarter-final appearance in 1990.",

      "It would be inconceivable to suggest that a nation with the history of Italy would miss another World Cup, and yet, that is a distinct possibility. The Azzurri haven't played in the tournament since 2014, missing the 2018 and 2022 editions through the qualification stages.",
      "Here they are again, looking at the need to get through a play-off round to get through to the tournament for the first time in 12 years. Manchester City star Gianluigi Donnarumma, who signed from PSG for £25million last summer, gives them a chance, but the pressure that comes with needing to win the upcoming matches will test even their most notable stars.",
      "Robert Lewandowski is a modern-day great, having shown his quality on both the club and international stage. The striker has often faced a battle to drag Poland through some tough moments, but they have managed to qualify for the past two tournaments, appearing in 2018 and 2022.",
      "At 37, this is more than likely the final chance for Lewandowski to show his quality at the World Cup, but he risks missing out altogether. Poland will need to get past Albania in their first play-off game, before having the possibility of a one-off knockout match to book a place at the finals.",
      "Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai has made himself a household name in England, ever since making his move to the Premier League. Despite his moments of individual brilliance, he won't be making an appearance with Hungary at the World Cup this summer, following a tough qualification group.",
      "A 3-2 defeat at the hands of Ireland in the final kick of their final match ensured they won't be able to qualify, and will have to try again for 2030. Szoboszlai admitted the experience was \"very tough\", with the Liverpool ace left thinking what could have been for the upcoming tournament.",

      "England have struggled to get the best out of Trent Alexander-Arnold so far, while finding a space to fit him in the team on a regular basis. The right-back was deployed in midfield at times by Gareth Southgate, who often preferred other full-backs during his tenure as the head coach.",
      "While Thomas Tuchel is now in charge, the Real Madrid star has only received one call-up to his squad so far, coming in June 2025. With a mixture of injury issues and form concerns, there is a real chance that the 27-year-old misses out on the squad altogether for the summer.",

      "Wales are once again reliant on the qualification play-off route if they are to compete at the 2026 World Cup. They took it close, picking up an impressive 15 points from eight group games, but finished two points shy of the eventual winners, Belgium.",
      "The task ahead for the home nation is a clash with Bosnia and Herzegovina, before a possible tie that will be a one-off final for a place in the tournament. Premier League stars such as Brennan Johnson, Harry Wilson, and Ethan Ampadu will be keen to fire Wales to their second consecutive World Cup, with those play-off games taking place in March.",
      "Johnson may be the nation's main hope of qualifying, having made the move from Tottenham to Crystal Palace for £35million in the January transfer window. With an opportunity for more minutes and a return to form, he could take that momentum into the March internationals with Wales at an important time.",
      "Mikel Merino has been a mainstay for the Spain national team, having shown quality in the midfield, and a finishing touch in the opposition box. That has translated over to his form for Arsenal, where he has played as an auxiliary striker at times, alongside his usual role as a midfielder.",
      "While there is some hope that he will feature at the World Cup, there are doubts over his availability. Merino has picked up an injury, with a fractured bone in his foot, causing some discomfort, which will require a procedure to ensure that he can return to action as quickly as possible.",
      "Despite those hopes, some reports in Spain have claimed that Merino could miss the rest of the season, and will be facing a race against time to get fit and available for the World Cup.",

      "Northern Ireland earned themselves a chance at booking a place in the World Cup this summer by finishing as one of the best third-placed teams in the UEFA qualification stages. They managed to pick up nine points in six games in a group that included Germany, Slovakia and Luxembourg.",
      "Their reward for that achievement... a clash with Italy in the first round of the qualification play-offs. It'll be a tough test, but one that can be done, as the Azzurri have shown through their recent downfalls in these play-off rounds.",
      "That challenge is made tougher, however, through the absence of Conor Bradley. The defender picked up a serious knee injury that will see him out of action until next season at the earliest, with the Liverpool star only able to watch on and hope that his national team can pull off a miracle.",
      "Turkiye have been viewed as potential dark horses in recent competitions, but they haven't quite been able to turn that into results. There is a chance to do so at the World Cup, but they will also need to get through the qualification play-offs to give themselves an opportunity to do so.",
      "They take on Romania first up, with hope that they can lean on some of their best talent to step up and do the business. Kenan Yildiz is certainly one of those for his national team, with the youngster proving his quality for Juventus, while attracting attention from clubs across Europe.",
      "Translating that onto the national stage would be the next step on his way to stardom, but he risks missing a World Cup if he cannot.",
      "Denmark suffered heartbreak late on in their qualification clash with Scotland, which saw them lose their grasp on a place at the World Cup. An almighty collapse in their final two games resulted in the unlikely drop into the play-offs, where they will now face North Macedonia.",
      "Some familiar faces are in the Denmark camp, such as Rasmus Hojlund, Christian Eriksen, and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. They will be leaning on that experience and quality to get them through the upcoming matches, while burying the demons that were left from their defeat to Scotland.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed he left TNT Sport after his ideas for the channel were pushed aside. The former Manchester United defender left the channel in May last year after a decade.",
      "He departed following his final broadcast of the 2025 Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan. He was previously a regular face of the channel’s European, Premier League and domestic cup coverage.",
      "And he has now opened up on why he chose to depart the channel, with Ferdinand keen for a new challenge, having seen his ideas for a freshen up with the broadcasters ignored.",
      "Speaking to Men’s Health, the former defender said: “I like being tested. I like pressure. I had it fine at TNT. I could have signed a new contract at TNT. Easily. But that ain’t who I am really. It’s time for something new.",
      "“And with all due respect, I’d been trying to push [a new] side of things within the team and the group at TNT, and they weren’t really as receptive as I would’ve liked.",
      "“So that was another big reason why I go, ‘Okay, if you’re not going to jump in two-footed with me and hold hands, then I move on. We’ll see how I do when I go on my own’.",
      "“Because I saw the new world is that linear TV and live football are always going to be there, but there’s also another world outside the 90 minutes that intrigues me, which I look at like a fan.",
      "“So I want to know what the f*** these guys are eating, how do they sleep, how do they recover? I want to get the public closer to that and I want to be at the forefront of that.",
      "“But at the same time, this is just who I am. I’m not trying to be no one, I’m me. I do my own s***. I’ve always been in my own lane.”",
      "Since Ferdinand’s exit from TNT, he has continued his post-footballing career through a number of ventures. He has his own YouTube channel, where he regularly analyses the latest news from former club Man United. Ferdinand was also part of the draw for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The former defender rounded off his career in football in 2015 following a brief spell with Queens Park Rangers. Before that, he spent 12 glittering seasons with Man United, winning six league titles and the Champions League under legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Ferdinand also earned 81 appearances for England during his playing career.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has started four games under Michael Carrick(Image: Photo by Mike Morese/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's rumoured willingness to loan out Kobbie Mainoo for the remainder of the campaign has reportedly stunned several Premier League sides, as well as Napoli. Mainoo struggled during the opening months of the season under former boss Ruben Amorim and failed to earn a single Premier League start before the Portuguese manager's exit in December.",
      "At one point, Mainoo appeared destined for a loan move, until interim boss Michael Carrick stepped in. Napoli were particularly eager to bring the 21 year old in on a temporary basis for the rest of the season, whilst the midfielder also caught the eye of Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton.",
      "Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have both joined Napoli - McTominay on a permanent transfer and Hojlund on loan - and the duo have flourished since departing Old Trafford. Napoli manager Antonio Conte was keen to add another United player to his ranks following their impressive form.",
      "According to The Telegraph, there was 'genuine disbelief' in Naples that United were even considering allowing Mainoo to leave. Similar sentiments were reportedly echoed by 'many Premier League clubs' who had expressed interest in securing the youngster on loan.",
      "Throughout Amorim's tenure, the 41-year-old frequently emphasised his desire for players to 'stay and fight' rather than abandon ship at the first hint of difficulty - taking aim at what he perceived as an 'entitlement' mentality amongst certain academy graduates.",
      "He had also pointed to Casemiro as a prime example of a player who changed his attitude and battled his way back into the starting XI, stating: \"When I see Casemiro training, if everyone trains like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in training, in set-pieces training, even when they are playing ten versus goalkeeper, and the movements that he made, imagining the game, we will be a top team.",
      "\"If everyone works like Casemiro, and when I say work it's not just running, it's that focus. You can understand why that guy won five Champions Leagues, because if you pay attention to everything that he does with contract, with no contract, he's top player.\"",
      "Many interpreted this as another thinly-veiled dig at Mainoo.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo in action for Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Mirror also revealed that, following Carrick's appointment, Mainoo was informed he would feature in the squad for the rest of the campaign.",
      "This came with explicit instructions to concentrate on winning back his place at his boyhood club, whilst demonstrating that Amorim had made a mistake in sidelining him.",
      "Since Carrick took charge, Mainoo has been named in the starting line-up against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham.",
      "He is also expected to be in the frame to start their fixture at relegation-battling West Ham on Tuesday night (8pm).",

      "Ruben Amorim could replace Jose Mourinho at Benfica in the summer(Image: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images)",
      "Jose Mourinho will reportedly be offered the Portugal manager's job after Roberto Martinez steps down following the World Cup. Mourinho is currently in charge of Benfica but has previously made it clear that he would love to manage his country, opening up the possibility of another high-profile role for the 63-year-old.",
      "Martinez is preparing to lead Portugal at the World Cup, which kicks off in Canada, the United States and Mexico on June 11. Like many international bosses, including Thomas Tuchel with England, his contract will expire at the end of the tournament.",
      "The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is therefore planning ahead and has reportedly made Mourinho the top choice to replace Martinez. Mourinho signed a two-year contract when he joined Benfica in September following his exit from Fenerbahce, but ESPN says the FPF will try and lure him into international management for the first time in the summer.",
      "That possibility would open up the Benfica role for Ruben Amorim, who is currently without a job after being sacked by United at the start of January. Amorim's reputation has taken a hit in the Premier League, but he remains highly regarded in his home country and would be the top pick for Benfica if they lose Mourinho, given his success at Sporting Lisbon and the fact he spent nine years there as a player.",
      "Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google search.",
      "Mourinho has been at the top level of club management for over 20 years, taking charge of Porto, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Manchester United, Tottenham, Roma, Fenerbahce and Benfica. But he is yet to taste international management and has made it clear that he would only consider doing so with Portugal.",
      "\"I want to play a European Championship or a World Cup and unite a country around a team, as I have already done many times with the clubs,\" he said in an interview with Corriere Dello Sport in January last year while still at Fenerbahce. \"I want to do it for football and what this sport represents. It will be incredible.\"",
      "Then, when linked with the Brazil job - which eventually went to Carlo Ancelotti - he said: \"My destiny, in terms of internationals, is to play in a World Cup with the Portuguese national team. I never considered coaching the Brazilian national team.",
      "Jose Mourinho was appointed by Benfica earlier this season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"My first experience has to be with Portugal, and then people have to understand that I'm a professional and that I can coach other teams, but always teams with which I have something that connects me.",
      "\"Brazil, obviously, because of the historical relationship between our countries, England because it's my home, Italy, I worked there for several years, but my first experience with the national team has to be mine.\"",
      "Benfica are currently third in the Portuguese top flight, seven points adrift of leaders Porto and three behind Sporting. They face a two-legged play-off against Real Madrid for a place in the last 16 of the Champions League following a dramatic 4-2 win over Los Blancos in the final game of the group stage last month.",

      "A return to Italy with Juventus has also been suggested, while Manchester City are reportedly keeping tabs on the situation, according to the Telegraph. Tonali's representative recently added fuel to the fire by revealing his client is contemplating his future, sparking concern among Newcastle supporters that one of Eddie Howe's key players might leave.",

      "Throughout the final, legendary United boss Ferguson had been on at Carrick to move the ball forward more regularly. The midfielder, whose playing career started at United's opponents this Tuesday, West Ham, insists all but one of his passes were played forward - the one that Ferguson remembered.",
      "The Scot lost his temper on the touchline, and Carrick came in for one hell of a talking to at half-time. Writing in his autobiography, Between the Lines, Carrick said: \"The moment I entered the changing room, the boss launched into me. 'Pass the ball f***ing forward, I f***ing told you'. Sir Alex was raging.",

      "\"On the inside, I was fuming, saying to myself, 'I must have played 40 passes forward here, and he's picked the one where I've gone back'. But the boss was so wound up that I didn't dare voice my defence.\"",
      "A Wayne Rooney goal saw United win the match 1-0, despite centre-back Nemanja Vidic being shown a red card. And Carrick remained an important player for Ferguson, with the Scot later admitting he always thought highly of the midfielder.",
      "A big reason for this, as the Scot would explain, is that Carrick showed incredible maturity early on in his career when leaving the north east for West Ham at such a young age.",

      "Michael Carrick has had a great impact at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The debate around Michael Carrick’s Manchester United future continues to roll on. The former Red Devils midfielder was appointed last month as Ruben Amorim’s replacement on a deal until the end of the season.",
      "The idea was for Carrick to stabilise the ship ahead of stepping down in favour of a more high-profile name. But he has outperformed that original remit, leading the club to four consecutive wins, with many now clamouring for him to be given the role on a full-term basis.",
      "A number of former United stars have offered their take on a potential appointment, with some suggesting he should be a shoo-in. Other ex-Red Devils have claimed that club chiefs should stick to the original plan.",
      "With that being said, take a look at what every former United star has said when it comes to Carrick’s future at Old Trafford:",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Let’s start with the man himself. Carrick has regularly been asked about his take on the long-term Man United hotseat.",
      "And while he might have ambitions, he has kept them close to his chest. Speaking last week, he said: “I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got.",
      "“We want to be successful, and I want the club to be successful beyond the end of the season - if that's me, if that's somebody else.",
      "“At this stage, I can't control that and we'll see what happens, but it's certainly about trying to improve the team and making Manchester United stronger. Results over a short period of time don't change that.”",
      "Carrick has regularly spoken out on his role(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Pundit Gary Neville has never been afraid to share his opinion on the goings on at Old Trafford - and Carrick’s future is no different. Speaking just after the midfielder was given the job, he claimed that he should only fulfill his original remit.",
      "\"I hope he does really well,\" Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast. \"There cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond this season, for Michael and for the club.",
      "\"If he wins every game, look, we could be sat here in the season where he's done unbelievably well, and we're always thinking the fans are up and they're in the Champions League places, fifth or whatever. It could happen if there's a good run and we could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "\"I honestly feel like [you have to look at others] at the end of the season when you've got [Mauricio] Pochettino, [Thomas] Tuchel and [Carlo] Ancelotti.",
      "Gary Neville has shared his insight on United's search for a new manager(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"I've said Ancelotti. I just feel purely because he's 66 years of age, he's got probably the best job in the world right now. He's probably got one job left at club level.",
      "\"If there's one person who's got the patience, the composure, the experience of the Premier League.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Neville has since revealed that the Red Devils have already gotten the process of finding Carrick’s eventual replacement underway. He said: \"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else.",
      "“I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.”",
      "With Neville being against Carrick’s long-term appointment, he can count Roy Keane among the colleagues to agree with him. Speaking after his initial arrival, the Irishman said that United needed the ‘best of the best’.",
      "He has since softened on that stance, but still believes that United should look elsewhere. He said: “I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it. Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go ‘listen, good luck to him’, but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be",
      "“I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud (Van Nistelrooy), he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",
      "“But just cause you're doing well at United, it doesn't mean he'll do well at another club. He's got the players back, it's all been sliding doors moments. Great for him, and he's took advantage of it.”",
      "Roy Keane has taken a brutal stance when it comes to Michael Carrick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former defender Ferdinand has responded to those claims and suggested that he can’t wrap his head around Keane’s comments. He said: “No matter what Michael Carrick does, how well he does, and if he got the job on the back of a great ending to the season, there's still risk.",
      "“There's an element of risk, but with every one of the names that get thrown into the hat, there an element of risk with all of them.",
      "“I don't know in any walk of life, where someone comes in given the opportunity to do well, and put their first foot forward for a job opportunity, they smash it - and hopefully he carries on, at the moment he’s smashing it, four wins out of four, and people are going ‘no, he shouldn’t get it though’.",
      "“I don't understand that with Roy, I've got to be honest. I don't know how you can be so against it.”",
      "His former defensive colleague Stam has also shared his thoughts on the Red Devils’ search for a new manager and suggested that former Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi would be an excellent candidate instead of Carrick.",
      "He said: \"I like De Zerbi very much, you know, because of how he performed at Brighton and also now in Marseille. How he's playing with his teams, because he plays possession-based football, he's very good on the ball.",
      "\"He also sets the players in certain positions that it makes it really difficult for the opposition to press them. You know, he's going forward, he attacks. Scores a lot of goals, sometimes concedes, but you know that as a manager.",
      "\"But I think he's also a good man-manager. I think he's also good with the players and giving them the confidence, giving them the attention they need - and not only the starting XI, but also the other players within the squad. And that's what you need in a big club like that. So I would be very happy if they don't go for Carrick, and that they go for him.\"",
      "Jaap Stam and Dimitaor Berbatov have shared their thoughts on United's managerial decision(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Having enjoyed a successful period playing together at Old Trafford, former striker Berbatov is among those keen to see Carrick succeed - but has called for patience before any rash decision is made.",
      "\"I am a bit biased of course, because I used to play with him [Carrick] and I want him to get the job but let's wait until the end of the season and if they go the way they are right now, of course, why not?\", Berbatov said to ESPN FC.",
      "\"We have seen what happened before with Ole Gunnar Solskjær, I think it was the same story so let's not jump to conclusions yet, let's just enjoy game by game how United is improving and at the end of the season we will wait and see what happens.\"",
      "\"He [Carrick] is in this position to show that he is capable of doing these things. So far in the games that we have watched, everything is just happening for the team and for him. Until the end of the season will be a test, and then we'll see if Michael can get the job permanently.\"",
      "Meanwhile, fellow former striker Louis Saha is keen to see Carrick retained on a permanent basis.",
      "He said: \"I would love to see Michael given the chance. He's done very well. He's a very hardworking guy but humble as well. The results are going for him at the moment but not only the results, the way the team is playing and performing, we all can see the change straightaway. He's had the biggest impact since Sir Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "\"He does provide an answer to the question about the next manager. Necessity, I do think they need to think about Carrick very, very, very seriously there.",
      "\"We know the expectation is so big and sometimes both have certain types of conversations and they want to see a long term plan. Do they see this is a spell where everything is going well for Carrick? Who knows how he reacts when he's under more pressure.",
      "Louis Saha believes Carrick should be appointed permanently(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"So maybe he needs to be challenged in that sense to be considered for the full-time role. I don't know.",
      "\"What I see is that he understands the DNA of the club, he's been under pressure, maybe not as a manager but as a player, he understands how those managers have reacted before as he was part of the coaching staff. So he understands. He's not a rookie. So I do think he deserves his position but when names like Ancelotti, Zidane come into play, it's a kind of a different ball game.\"",
      "The final ex-United star to speak out was former midfielder Owen Hargreaves and he claims that the run of form under Carrick makes it impossible not to give him the role permanently.",
      "\"I don’t see how you couldn’t give it to him,\" said Hargreaves to MEN. \"What would have been the point of working that hard? You can get elite managers in, but that doesn't guarantee success.",
      "\"What Michael’s doing is very impressive. The fans are happy, which is important. The players are happy and that’s important, but the most important thing is that the team wins.",
      "\"United have had big-name managers on the bench. They had two of the greatest in the last 10 years, up there with Pep and Ancelotti: Van Gaal and Mourinho. A huge name comes with more expectation.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Barcelona are keen to keep Marcus Rashford beyond his loan move(Image: JOSEP LAGO, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are still making preparations for Marcus Rashford's departure this summer, as speculation about his future continues. The homegrown talent is currently on loan at Barcelona following his exclusion from the squad by former boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "His switch to Spain came half a year after he sealed a temporary stint with Aston Villa. Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan with the Midlands club after falling out of favour at United, but a deal wasn't made permanent.",
      "Under the terms of the current arrangement, Barca possess an option to sign him permanently this summer for £26million. Previous reports had indicated that the Spanish club were reluctant to meet the agreed price and were attempting to negotiate a slightly reduced fee.",
      "Recent updates suggest that United were unwilling to drop their asking price, whilst Barcelona are now prepared to trigger the clause to complete a permanent transfer. The Sun reports that United are preparing for a future without Rashford, despite suggestions that Michael Carrick is keen on bringing him back.",
      "The club had no plans to recall the player in January, with caretaker manager Carrick not looking beyond the summer when his contract runs out. It is understood that Rashford favours a departure from United in the summer window, regardless of whether a permanent switch to Barcelona materialises.",
      "He reportedly wants his long-term situation sorted before linking up with England for the summer's World Cup in North America. If this proves to be the case, it would provide United with a welcome financial injection early in the transfer window as they seek to strengthen their squad.",
      "Marcus Rashford is on loan with Barcelona from Man United this season. (Image: Angel Martinez, Getty Images)",
      "Any money received for Rashford would count as pure profit under the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability rules (PSR). The 28-year-old has already made his feelings known through comments made back in October.",
      "\"I'm really enjoying my time in Spain; the weather is the best,\" he said. \"A very big change. I'm learning every day, I'm enjoying it a lot. I hope to be here for a long time. I get along very well with Roony [Bardghji], also Jules [Kounde] or Frenkie [de Jong]. It's a team in which we all mix.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"We are united. The team is fantastic. I just have to be in the right position.",
      "\"I'll keep trying to do this. We have to keep it up to be our best version. We have a lot more to do this season.\"",
      "This season, Rashford has netted 10 goals and contributed a further 13 assists across 34 appearances in all competitions. He'll be back on the pitch on Thursday when Barca face Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey semi-final.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Benjamin Sesko scored a brilliant equaliser for United at West Ham",
      "Michael Carrick believes Benjamin Sesko is ready to go to another level after praising the impact he made in rescuing a point for Manchester United at West Ham. The 22-year-old is yet to start any of Carrick's five games in charge but scored a decisive injury-time goal for the second time in three games, with his instinctive finish in the 96th minute securing a point after Tomas Soucek had opened the scoring.",
      "Sesko has two goals in 61 minutes of football under Carrick and has five goals in his last six games, only two of which have been starts, and despite his lack of action he looks in a rich vein of form at the moment.",
      "The £73million striker was unfortunate not to start at the London Stadium and Carrick admitted he could have brought him on earlier than the 69th minute, with United in need of a focal point to their attack, but when he did come on he proved to be worth the wait.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "\"It's always the balance. I think the boys have done fantastically well who have played as well,\" said Carrick. \"That's the importance of the whole group and importance of the squad and I've said it to them after every game.",
      "\"Leny’s come on and made a big difference for us tonight in big moments and then Ben scored again. Ben’s doing a lot work. He's in a good place, he's ready to kick on, it's just managing the balance.",
      "\"We could have changed things a little bit earlier. That's obviously the decision we're always trying to make and we were actually having a bit of a spell in the game at that point where we thought we might come back into it, but when Ben came on the pitch he made a big difference.\"",

      "Sesko took his goal brilliantly, producing a clever finish to make Bryan Mbeumo's cross look better than it was and loop the ball over Hammers goalkeeper Mads Hermansen.",
      "Carrick has referenced the quality of his finishing in training and is delighted with the steps the young striker is taking in his first season at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It's an unbelievable finish from the angle to generate that, to get it on target, to finish it,\" he said. \"It's some goal from him. He's capable of that, Ben. He's done it over time. It's not that he's just suddenly burst on the scene.",
      "\"He's been doing it, he's proven that he can score goals as well. He's been doing it in training for us as well. It's not surprising, to be honest. I think that's what he does, it's what he's good at. But certainly to actually do it and to feel it. He did it with the last one [against Tottenham], tonight, a little bit different with the emotion of the game, but certainly important and a big moment for him and us.\"",
      "Carrick opted to keep faith with the same team that had beaten Fulham and Tottenham, but a fluid attack failed to fire in the capital, although that flexibility was helpful in the end as he threw players on to try and make the difference.",
      "\"There's a little bit on different games as well as situations in games and how you want to attack, where the space is or what the game looks like,\" he said. \"We probably didn't quite get the balance right, if we're honest, for the first part of the game",
      "\"Which happens, teams are allowed to stop you from scoring, but we kept going and mixed things up, and because we have got that flexibility, I think it certainly helps to find different solutions.\"",

      "Yoro came on for Harry Maguire at the same time as Sesko replaced Matheus Cunha, with a quarter of the game remaining at the London Stadium. West Ham had a couple of big chances on the break to double their lead, but 20-year-old Yoro produced two key blocks to keep his team in the game.",
      "It was the first time he had made it on the pitch in Carrick's five games in charge but his contributions proved vital when Sesko's brilliant finish earned the point that extended the unbeaten run and Carrick was quick to praise the centre-back after the game.",

      "Carrick also threw Joshua Zirkzee on for the final nine minutes as he threw caution to the wind and although he knew that would leave United exposed, he was happy to take the gamble.",

I thought his two bits of defending, one-vs-one, defending the counterattack, which we knew he was going to have to do at times, throwing the bodies forward. I thought those two moments when he blocked shots were huge.",
      "\"He deserves a lot of credit for that, to give us the chance to then go and get the goal that got something out of the game.

      "\"Mixed feelings, we know we weren't quite at our best, I think credit to West Ham, a little bit of closing certain spaces up, but I think we can be better, the boys are a bit frustrated and disappointed with that, which is a really good sign for me,\" he said.",
      "\"Then finishing with a late goal when we've had to find one is a good moment and another positive for us to know that we can do that. We don't want to have to pull on it and use it too often but I think in the grand scheme I think there's points we can take and we kind of dust ourselves down a little bit, assess it, take these games over a five game period and to just have one draw in there I think is a big positive so mixed feelings really.\"",

      "Sesko scored a brilliant late goal",
      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with West Ham in the Premier League on Tuesday. Michael Carrick had won his first four games in charge as interim boss and looked set to taste his first defeat since his appointment.",
      "West Ham opened the scoring shortly after play resumed for the second half. Tomas Soucek latched onto a cross from Jarrod Bowen to score what looked like being the matchwinner at the London Stadium.",
      "United struggled to respond and created very little as they chased an equaliser in the closing stages, but Benjamin Sesko scored late in added time to salvage a point.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "Sesko is a winner",
      "Sesko scored three goals in Darren Fletcher's two games in charge, but he was moved to the bench by Carrick. The 22-year-old did not sulk and scored a late winner from the bench in the 3-2 win against Fulham.",
      "After overlooking Sesko again last weekend, it felt like Carrick would reward Sesko for his strong run of form by starting him against West Ham, but he had to settle for another cameo from the bench.",
      "United found it difficult to penetrate West Ham's backline and the game was screaming out for Sesko by half-time. The Slovenia international was the only player on the bench not wearing a coat when the substitutes took their place for the second half, but Carrick took his time to get Sesko on the pitch.",
      "Carrick said it's \"never easy\" to pick his line-up when he spoke ahead of facing West Ham. The former midfielder had not put a foot wrong in four games, but got his team selection wrong for the first time.",
      "That did not stop Sesko from salvaging a point in the final seconds of added time, though. The finish to secure a draw was spectacular, yet Sesko remained calm and urged his teammates to rush back to prepare for the restart. That mentality will serve him well in Manchester - he wanted more.",
      "Carrick's reaction",
      "More than half of Casemiro's goals for United have been headers, and the Brazilian thought he'd added another to his back catalogue when he found the net in the 63rd minute.",
      "United had fallen behind at the beginning of the second half, and Casemiro came close to producing a response, but VAR chalked the goal off because he was offside by the matter of inches.",
      "Carrick's body language when Casemiro's header hit the net was telling. The 44-year-old allows himself a rare release of emotion on the touchline when United score, but calmly walked back to the bench, seemingly unsure of whether the goal would stand.",
      "United's interim coach did not react when VAR announced the goal had been disallowed. Carrick seemingly already knew the outcome before the final decision. He could also sense the game slipping away, but introducing Sesko in the 69th minute was a change that should have been made much sooner.",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as a Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "Mbeumo's work rate",
      "The first half was dull at the London Stadium, partly because United struggled to get their attackers involved. Bryan Mbeumo was quiet and didn't offer much going forward, however, there was a moment when he demonstrated why he's a manager's dream to have in the dressing room.",
      "Mbeumo started down the middle before moving to the left, and at one point he sprinted back to left-back to help stop an attack between Bowen and Crysencio Summerville.",
      "The Cameroon international has been an excellent signing because of the quality he's provided in front of goal, but providing defensive cover when it's required is just as important.",
      "Mbeumo isn't afraid to do the dirty work when his teammates need a hand. United have had wingers in recent years who did not have the same attitude, which is one of many reasons why Mbeumo is an upgrade.",
      "Analyst team impact",
      "United have significantly improved their set-piece record. The Reds scored from a clever set-piece against Tottenham last weekend and came close to scoring from another well-worked routine against West Ham.",
      "Fernandes sent a well-weighted, low-driven ball in to Luke Shaw, who was able to lose his marker because West Ham were not expecting him to be the target.",
      "Shaw connected well, only to be denied by Aaron Wan-Bissaka on the line. Carrick praised United analyst Kaita Hasegawa for his role in designing the set-piece goal against Spurs, and Hasegawa was spotted chatting among the analyst team in the press box when Shaw's shot was blocked.",
      "Travis Binnion was spotted sitting alongside the analyst team again. Binnion is part of Carrick's backroom staff and sits in the stands to relay in-game tactical information to the bench.",
      "Shaw's attempt was not successful, but involving a player with a poor scoring record from the set-piece highlights the analyst team's creativity.",

      "Diogo Dalot: Booked for a foul on Summerville and struggled to handle the winger all night. Looked nervous as a result and almost played his team into trouble in the first half. 5",
      "Harry Maguire: Looked to be struggling with a knock at times but stood up well defensively and won plenty of duels again. 7",
      "Lisandro Martinez: A night when United needed more of his line-breaking passes. Could have done more to stop the cross coming in for the goal. 6",
      "Luke Shaw: Bowen a difficult opponent but he played Shaw like a fiddle for the goal. Let a long ball bounce and then exploit the space when the full-back gambles on the next tackle. 4",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as a Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "Casemiro: Unlucky with the disallowed goal after a good header. One of the better performers. Read the game well and combative in his second start in four days. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Classy on the ball but didn't cover himself in glory for the goal. Blame on Shaw but Mainoo had Soucek's run covered and then let him get the first touch. 6",
      "Amad: Feels like he's been running out of steam and this game proved it. Saw plenty of the ball but didn't do enough to cause West Ham problems. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Well below his usual standards on a night when United needed some of his usual magic. Just couldn't make things happen. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: Dropped deep to try and get on the ball and make things happen but too often it left United without a focal point. Interchanging with Fernandes didn't work. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Stationed out on the left for the first three-quarters of the game and the role didn't do him any favours. Never really involved. 5",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Tenacious against Castellanos in one duel. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Should have been introduced a lot earlier and produced a brilliant finish to earn a point. 7",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Little time to make an impact but nearly scored before Sesko did. 6",

      "Benjamin Sesko resued a point for United at West Ham",
      "This was the test that it felt like we had been waiting for, and for Manchester United and Michael Carrick, it was one that produced more questions than answers. After a dream start in the dugout, the idea of a Carrick coronation got a reality check at the London Stadium.",
      "Four wins out of four had propelled Carrick to the top of the bookmakers' list of candidates to get the job long-term, but a night that ended with a bang still raised the kind of concerns that always felt likely to appear at some point in time.",
      "Everything Carrick had touched had turned to gold in the first few weeks of his reign, but his side had won games that had been played to suit them and then took advantage of Cristian Romero's moment of madness on Saturday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Against a West Ham side fighting for their lives, this was always going to be different. For the first time, United dominated possession, but you get the impression this team would rather play without as much of the ball and have more space to run into. They turned 65% of the ball into just three shots on target.",
      "It felt like Carrick played it safe by sticking with a winning formula. This was always likely to be a game crying out for the physical presence of a natural striker. Having decided not to start Benjamin Sesko, he then left it too long to bring him on, only for the £73million striker to show he was the missing ingredient after all.",
      "For most of the second half, it had looked like being a night of misery for United and their excellent away support, who had somehow seen their team lose three successive games at the most welcoming of Premier League stadiums for visiting teams. It was nearly a fourth.",
      "They certainly looked out of ideas when Carrick and Steve Holland stood motionless in the technical area with a minute to go. They had played their chips and the game was drifting away.",
      "This coaching team has won praise for making the most of free weeks to devise perfect game plans for Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham, but it looked like time worked against them here.",
      "They had only a couple of days to get things right for this game and although there were times when some of the football was nice to watch, it was always in areas where West Ham were happy to watch it too, at least until the belated introduction of Sesko and then Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The good news for Carrick is that the Slovenian's goal salvages some momentum, but the questions will keep coming now. United have 13 days until they face Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium and you can be sure that David Moyes will take inspiration from Nuno Espirito Santo's game plan.",
      "But just as four successive wins didn't guarantee Carrick was going to get the job in the summer, neither does one setback mean he should be discounted now. After a few days, United will regather at Carrington and work out how to break down a low block and prove this was an aberration rather than the start of a trend that will prove costly.",
      "It had felt obvious early on that this was going to be a very different test. West Ham were quick to settle into a compact 5-4-1 shape and ask the visitors to break them down. Carrick had benefitted from playing teams happy to get into a football match so far, but West Ham were just as happy to spoil one.",
      "United found the key to unlocking Tottenham came from a corner and they nearly repeated the trick. This time Bruno Fernandes sent in a low cross to Luke Shaw, who made a run across the box eight yards out and turned the ball goalwards, only for Aaron Wan-Bissaka to clear off the line.",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as a Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "That was the closest United came in an otherwise forgettable first half. Their approach play was easy on the eye but it offered no cutting edge.",
      "If anything, it was West Ham who looked more dangerous on their rare forays forward and they made one count right at the start of the second half. Shaw was too passive in dealing with a long ball towards Jarrod Bowen, and then committed to a tackle in midfield that left Bowen with the freedom of the flank when he didn't win it.",
      "Bowen was able to run unchecked into the United box, and his low cross was cleverly turned home by Tomas Soucek, who ghosted between Lisandro Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo, but was one of several West Ham players attacking the box.",
      "That was a clear point of difference to United, who were doing their best work in areas that wouldn't hurt West Ham. Casemiro saw a header disallowed for offside, but the fact that he was regularly becoming United's most advanced player spoke to the lack of penalty box threat they carried.",
      "That was something Carrick sought to address with the introduction of Sesko, but waiting until the 69th minute to do so invited scrutiny. Sesko had United's first shot on target in more than 50 minutes when he forced Mads Hermansen into a low save from the edge of the box.",
      "He had the next shot on target as well. A brilliant instinctive finish from Bryan Mbeumo's cross salvaging a point for United. Sesko will surely start at Everton when United can expect a game that looks very similar to this one.",

      "Manchester United have experienced a renewed sense of optimism following the appointment of Michael Carrick.",
      "The former Red Devils midfielder returned to Old Trafford just a month ago after Ruben Amorim's departure and has restored belief in a squad that desperately needed it. United's prospects of securing Champions League football have significantly improved under the interim head coach following his encouraging start in charge.",
      "Whilst 12 matches remain for United, focus on the summer transfer window continues to intensify with each passing day. The impact Carrick has managed to achieve could present an opportunity for him to be considered for the permanent role.",
      "Alongside the victories, his arrival has reportedly already prevented the departure of one club star. Regarding contracted United players, the club's position on a potential Marcus Rashford return is believed to be firmly established, as we examine some of the headlines emerging from Old Trafford.",

      "The 20-year-old's transformation has been remarkable. Prior to Carrick's arrival, Mainoo not only failed to start a single Premier League match under Amorim, but was reportedly set to depart on loan for the remainder of the season.",
      "The midfielder was rumoured to be on his way to Napoli, with Antonio Conte reportedly keen to bring the England international to Italy where he would have reunited with former United colleague Scott McTominay.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's career at Old Trafford has been reignited under Michael Carrick(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Several Premier League clubs including Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton were all said to be interested in signing Mainoo before that possibility was abruptly closed following his return to the starting line-up. The Telegraph reported a sense of \"genuine disbelief\" in Naples due to United's apparent readiness to let Mainoo go.",
      "This sentiment was reportedly echoed by \"many Premier League clubs\" until Mainoo was informed, following Carrick's appointment, that he would be reinstated to the first team in a more significant role.",
      "The 28-year-old is currently thriving at Barcelona and has previously expressed his desire to stay in Catalonia beyond the summer. The LaLiga heavyweights have the option to purchase Rashford - who has contributed to 23 goals this season - for £26million, an option they're thought to be eager to exercise.",
      "Marcus Rashford is enjoying life in Spain(Image: Getty Images)",

      "It appears there is a consensus amongst all parties that a fresh start is the best course of action for the England winger. According to the Sun, United are standing firm and preparing for life without Rashford.",
      "With United chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox spearheading efforts to appoint the club's next permanent manager, Rashford's future remains unchanged, despite prior suggestions Carrick would welcome a reunion.",
      "It's been more than a year since he last featured for the club and he has no squad number at United since Matheus Cunha claimed his No. 10 following his summer arrival. United will likely enter the market this summer for a wide forward to replace both Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",

      "For now, the club wish to temper expectations and as reported by MEN Sport, sources close to the youngster understand it is not much hassle in keeping the 15-year-old grounded. He has a strong family support and a circle of friends, who don't let him get ahead of himself.",

      "There will be a question mark over Casemiro, who has sometimes struggled when the games come thick and fast. The problem is that Manuel Ugarte is a significant drop-off from the Brazilian. I'd take the risk with Casemiro and hope his legs hold out before an 11-day break.",
      "One player who deserves a start is Benjamin Sesko. He has made an impact as a sub and this game looks ideal to bring him in. I would take Amad out, purely because Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have looked a little more threatening in front of goal.",
      "Tyrone's team",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Carrick will surely be tempted to pick another unchanged starting XI after a fourth win on the bounce, but I would make two changes to the team: Ugarte for Casemiro and Sesko for Amad.",
      "The Ugarte selection may be controversial, but Casemiro was really poor against Burnley at the beginning of January because he'd started two games in the space of four days. I'd pick the Brazilian if there was a guarantee he could perform, but his inclusion would mean another two starts in four days.",
      "Ugarte should benefit from coming into a team playing with confidence. The Sesko decision doesn't need much explaining because he deserves a start after a positive spell. Mbeumo simply can't be dropped and Amad has played more football than Cunha, so he should move to the bench.",
      "Steven's team",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "United may have a limited number of matches this season and plenty of players deserve their chance to feature, but with momentum as high as it is right now Carrick must stick with what is working best. There is a slight concern about starting Casemiro considering the tight turnaround.",
      "However, the Reds have a long break after this one due to being out of the FA Cup so the Brazilian has plenty of time to recuperate after this fixture before they take on Everton. Mbeumo remains the obvious choice at the top of the pitch.",
      "Carrick's side look better when he is leading the line. Sesko can offer a different headache for the Hammers if called upon from the bench.",

      "Sandro Tonali is a new midfielder on Manchester United's transfer radar(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sandro Tonali is considering leaving Newcastle United this summer to play Champions League football next season. The midfielder has been linked with Manchester United in recent days as the club plans to bolster its midfield.",
      "United are understood to be prioritising a new central midfielder for the 2026/27 season after opting not to invest in the previous two windows. Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton have all been linked, but Tonali is the latest name on their radar.",
      "The Telegraph has reported that the 25-year-old is expected to be at the heart of a transfer saga in the summer. United are already confirmed to lose one midfielder when Casemiro departs and are expected to spend big on his replacement.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Newcastle paid £55million for Tonali in 2023 and with the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Declan Rice moving more than £100m, the Magpies are in a comfortable place to negotiate a hard price.",
      "On deadline day, some reports suggested that the Italian midfielder had been offered to Arsenal. The Gunners decided not to make a move, but that has cast doubt on his future on Tyneside.",
      "Sandro Tonali is reportedly on Man United's transfer radar(Image: Newcastle United via Getty Image)",
      "According to Tonali's agent, Giuseppe Riso, his exit out of Eddie Howe's squad is a possibility at the end of the season. \"Newcastle are having a hard time of letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,\" he told Sky Italy.",
      "\"We'll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We'll see how the season ends and then we'll decide what to do. There's no preference at the moment.",
      "\"It's still early. What we're saying today won't apply tomorrow. Newcastle couldn't let him go now, and there's no point in moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.\"",
      "\"I don't think so, but lots of things happen without my knowledge,\" Howe said when asked if the speculation around Tonali's future would unsettle the midfielder. \"As far as I'm aware, we've got player who is an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.",
      "\"He's very happy here, he's got a great relationship with me, his teammates, and seems really happy within himself. That would surprise me [if Tonali became unsettled], but our best players will always attract glances from other clubs - that's just the reality of football.",
      "\"We want to keep our group together, we want to be progressive and Sandro plays a part in that. All encompassed, I don't see an issue but I don't control everything. There was certainly no intention from our side to lose Sandro at all. He's such an integral player to what we're doing. He's very happy here.",
      "\"He is absolutely fine. I had discussions with him yesterday [Monday] and he is absolutely focused on playing for us.\"",

      "Gary Lineker has humorously suggested that Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo might consider taking legal action against former manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The England international's career has seen a resurgence under Michael Carrick, after struggling for playing time under the Portuguese coach. The ex-Match of the Day host made the light-hearted comment following another standout performance from Mainoo in a United victory, as United extended their unbeaten run to four games against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "The 20-year-old was on the verge of leaving Old Trafford in search of regular first-team football, but is now close to securing a new contract at the Theatre of Dreams, having reaffirmed his value to the team.",
      "Lineker suggested that Mainoo's absence from the starting line-up had been harmful, even jokingly proposing that the midfielder could contemplate suing Amorim.",

      "Manchester United won 2-0 against Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. Michael Carrick has made a huge impact since his appointment and oversaw a fourth win on the bounce in the top-flight.",
      "Tottenham made a promising start, but defender Cristian Romero was shown a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on Casemiro, which handed United the advantage. Bryan Mbeumo then gave Tottenham a mountain to climb when he opened the scoring at the end of the first half.

      "Carrick's family moment",
      "Anyone who has kept a close eye on Carrick during matches will have noticed his calm demeanour. He rarely shows emotion and stays remarkably composed, but there is a release when United score.",
      "Carrick passionately fist-pumped when Mbeumo fired United into the lead at the end of the first half, and he turned around on the touchline to look at his family celebrating in the directors' box.",
      "The 44-year-old has season tickets at Old Trafford with his family, meaning he attended a few games before his appointment, but his wife and children now have a better view in the directors' box.",
      "Carrick's son Jacey was spotted in the away end at Arsenal last month. Carrick has spoken about how much United means to him. He was raised in Newcastle and spent time in London with West Ham and Tottenham, but he has spent his most cherished years in Manchester.",
      "There may be more special years to come at Old Trafford for Carrick. It's still too early to say whether he should be given the job on a permanent basis, but he couldn't have made a better start.",
      "Casemiro enjoyed the goal",
      "Casemiro was so chuffed with Fernandes' late goal to wrap up the victory that he attempted to persuade Senne Lammens to celebrate with the team in the corner by the Stretford End.",
      "Casemiro shared a warm embrace with Lisandro Martinez before waving his hands to gesture to Lammens to join in with his teammates. The goalkeeper briefly thought about it, jogging to the halfway line, but decided to resist the temptation.",
      "Lammens is sensible and level-headed. He knew the job wasn't done yet and didn't want to get ahead of himself by joining in with the celebrations. Andre Onana, his predecessor, did not have that perspective.",
      "The unsung analyst",
      "United are the strongest team from set-pieces this season, having recorded the highest number of goals scored per 100 set-plays. Arsenal have earned a reputation as being prolific from set-pieces, but United have a better record from fewer of them, and they scored from a beautiful routine against Spurs.",
      "Fernandes played the corner short to Mainoo, who found Mbeumo in the box. There was still plenty for the Cameroon international to do - and his finish into the bottom right corner was sublime.",
      "Carlos Fernandes looked after set-pieces when Ruben Amorim was in charge. Fernandes came onto the touchline every time United won a set-piece, but Carrick's backroom staff remained seated.",
      "It's understood set-pieces are a collective responsibility among the current coaching staff, however, perhaps Kaita Hasgawa deserves another mention for doing important work behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim namedropped Hasgawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and is thought to play an important role.",
      "Hasgawa sat with the analyst team beside the press box against Tottenham. The analysts would have taken great satisfaction from another set-piece goal, especially after a corner routine that was so well-worked.",
      "Stretford End jeers",
      "The Romero red card changed the complexion of the game. The contest had flowed well and Tottenham looked dangerous, but Romero could have no complaints when Michael Oliver showed him a straight red.",
      "The challenge on Casemiro was reckless and the Brazilian looked in a world of pain when he slumped to the turf. Thomas Frank tried to reason with the fourth official, but had no serious case to overturn it.",
      "The Stretford End chanted Casemiro's name while he received treatment, but their attention turned to Romero as he returned to the dressing room. \"Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,\" fans taunted as Romero walked off.",
      "Romero slammed Tottenham's board for their lack of investment when the January transfer window closed, but the Spurs captain only had himself to blame for his side's defeat.",
      "The classy Munich tributes",
      "It was the 68th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster on Friday. United held a memorial service at Old Trafford, and there were further tributes from fans in the Stretford End before the Totttenham game.",
      "United fans unfurled a \"Busby Babes\" banner in the upper tier of the stand, which was followed by a \"we'll never die\" banner being unfurled in the lower tier. Carrick laid a wreath on the pitch alongside Frank.",
      "The players wore black armbands, and Fernandes wore a special captain's armband to pay tribute to the tragedy. Most wouldn't have seen the Munich clock attached to Fernandes' arm. \"Stand up for the Busby Babes,\" was aired in the first half, and thousands of supporters rose to their feet.",
      "United show their class with their tributes each year to the Munich Air Disaster. Fernandes attended the memorial service on the day before the game, and the armband he wore was a nice touch.",

      "The forward, though, managed to play on before he was replaced by Ferran Torres after 67 minutes. The win for Barca came at the end of a week in which Sport claimed club chiefs have reached a 'unanimous' decision to sign the Rashford on a permanent deal once his current loan ends this summer.",

Fletcher, who is the son of Darren and the twin brother of Jack, has been in and around the first team this season.",
      "While his brother has made three appearances for the Reds this season, Fletcher has had to remain patient to get his own chance in the Premier League. With the game entering its final moments on Saturday, interim head coach Michael Carrick gave the youngster the opportunity for his first senior minutes as he replaced Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Reflecting on the experience at full time, Fletcher told MUTV: \"It's a mad day. I'm absolutely buzzing. The best day of my life, it's a dream come true. I've just got to thank everyone for supporting me, throughout the way.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "This is the season of Premier League bosses being told they’re ‘getting sacked in the morning’. But Thomas Frank, Sean Dyche and friends should make it to lunch.",
      "It is a particularly close-run sack race in mid-February of a season in which six managers have already left their posts.",
      "Under-pressure Brighton manager Hurzeler was told by his own fans he’d be getting “sacked in the morning” over the weekend.",
      "And Thomas Frank was treated to a rendition of that particular chorus after another Spurs defeat left them 16th and three points above the relegation zone.",
      "But when are Premier League managers generally actually sacked? This is vitally important research which takes into account every coach fired since the start of last season, based on when the club statements confirming their departures landed, to see whether they really were sacked in the morning after all.",
      "",
      "The decision was probably made around the time of the acerbic meeting held between Amorim and Jason Wilcox the previous Friday, which itself was held after a damaging home draw with Wolves a few days before.",
      "But Amorim was informed of the mutually necessary removal from his Manchester United post during the morning of January 5, which was relayed publicly by the club at 10:08am.",
      "The draw with Leeds at Elland Road looks like a passable result in isolated hindsight; what would transpire over the next few hours from Amorim’s press conference onwards was so unexpected that no-one even sang about his impending morning-based sacking.",
      "",
      "It took Chelsea 12 hours and 18 minutes of 2026 to dispense with a manager, which is pretty good going even for them.",
      "Maresca was the first ever Premier League coach to be sacked on New Year’s Day, concluding a curious three weeks or so of unexplained cryptic public comments and rising internal tensions.",
      "Having seemingly made it his early resolution to force the collective hand of the Stamford Bridge suits by picking passive-aggressive fights with the medical staff and overseeing a poor run of results and performances, Maresca made it until just after lunchtime of the first day of January.",
      "",
      "How embarrassed the Wolves supporters who informed Pereira of his dawn departure must be that the confirmation actually arrived at 12:24pm the following day.",
      "They had, to be fair, warned the Portuguese that he would be Sacked In The Morning during the two games immediately before that decisive Fulham defeat in November, when Wolves fell to Burnley and Chelsea at Molineux.",
      "“Two months ago they sang my name, because together with the work we did last season, we are competing in the Premier League and not Championship. Now they sing my name to sack me,” Pereira bristled at the time after seemingly offering some of the fans out.",
      "He cannot have been particularly surprised when they mocked him again as he went over to apologise for a 3-0 thrashing at Craven Cottage in what was ultimately his farewell.",
      "",
      "It ranks among the shortest manager sacking statements ever at 39 words, with the shy and retiring Evangelos Marinakis not even quoted as the club decided to ‘make no further comment at this time’.",
      "The call came at 2:42pm, within 20 minutes of a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea at the City Ground to which the travelling support kindly issued a Sacked In The Morning backing track.",
      "Postecoglou must have been used to it by that point. Arsenal fans chanted it in literally his first game and it was ringing around St James’ Park during his seventh.",
      "Hell, by the end of his sixth of eight in charge it was the Forest supporters themselves who called for Postecoglou’s head, which the Australian naturally put down to “just the climate we’re in” rather than him literally proving incapable of winning football matches.",
      "",
      "“I didn’t hear anything but I understand the frustrations. People are entitled to their opinion,” Potter pretended after the West Ham fans joined a Sacked In The Morning chorus led by Crystal Palace supporters at the London Stadium during a 2-1 home defeat on September 20.",
      "West Ham did not play another game for nine days but waited seven before bringing to an overdue end the Potter experiment at 10:35am on a Saturday.",
      "",
      "In perhaps the most Sacked In The Morning a manager has ever been, Nuno was officially relieved of his duties at about quarter past midnight on September 9.",
      "It had been the most open of secrets long before then as Nuno actively took on a ‘furious’ Marinakis and new Global Head of Football Edu to the point he did seem to want to be pushed instead of walking.",
      "His quest to relegate Forest as manager of a resurgent West Ham does not feel like a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Having spent most of the second half of an abandoned Premier League season being told by opposition supporters that he would be Sacked In The Morning, Postecoglou rose above it to lift the Europa League trophy come May.",
      "Then he was sacked at 5:05pm on a random Friday just over a fortnight later because Spurs cannot have nice things.",
      "",
      "A day after securing the earliest relegation in Premier League history, Juric was asked to pack his bags and leave the St Mary’s premises. Quite what delayed it until 12:15pm is a mystery.",
      "",
      "With preparations well underway for their FA Cup tie against Peterborough at 7:45pm that evening, Everton allowed Dyche to oversee a morning training session before sending him on his way at 4:34pm.",
      "Leighton Baines had just over three hours to compose himself on “a difficult day” which at least ended with the Toffees beating ‘Fergie’s killjoy nepo baby’.",
      "",
      "Lopetegui might have sensed something was up when his pre-match afternoon press conference before an FA Cup tie against Aston Villa was cancelled, even if he did take training in the morning.",
      "The Spaniard was said to be ‘furious’ with how it all played out up to his official departure at 3:15pm; he should arguably have simply won more than six of his 20 Premier League games or not spent £40m on Max Kilman.",
      "",
      "“You don’t even get sacked in the morning now, you’ve got to change your song mate!” said Postecoglou a few days after his Spurs side delivered the final blow to Martin at Southampton.",
      "Barely 20 minutes after completing his post-match duties following a 5-0 hammering at home to Postecoglou’s men in December 2024, Martin had met his Saintly demise around 10:15pm.",
      "He was then given the Sacked In The Morning treatment for most of his Rangers reign.",
      "",
      "It was earlier that same day, around 12:55pm, when the axe finally fell on O’Neil at Wolves after a defeat at home to Ipswich.",
      "O’Neil had declared that “the negative noise is always loudest” after being jeered off following a 4-0 humbling at Goodison Park ten days prior. Being 19th is pretty resounding too.",
      "",
      "There was little sense from anyone outside the executive boardrooms at the King Power Stadium that Cooper would be shown the Leicester door after a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea made it five games without a win.",
      "Yet the news broke at 3:50pm the following afternoon that the manager who had the Foxes in 16th was being let go. For Ruud van Nistelrooy. Then Marti Cifuentes. Then a sustained fall into a Championship relegation fight for which Cooper would have been perfect.",
      "",
      "The meeting in which Ten Hag learned his Manchester United journey was being brought to a belated end, led by Omar Berrada and Dan Ashworth, was said to be cordial, respectful and a direct contrast to the summit that ultimately put Amorim out of his misery.",
      "All was done by 11:50am on the morning of October 29, 2024. Manchester United just about managed that announcement, having bungled every other aspect of Ten Hag’s final months.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur sources have refused to rule out Thomas Frank leaving the club before next Sunday’s North London derby with Arsenal.",
      "At least Ruben Amorim never even vaguely teased he might string together five wins. Michael Carrick should be ashamed for taking Manchester United close",
      "Tottenham Hotspur boss Thomas Frank has insisted that he will remain in charge of the Premier League giants after Tuesday’s loss against Newcastle United.",
      "Spurs continue to slide closer and closer to relegation yet still Thomas Frank remains in charge. Surely it can’t last much longer. Can it?",
      "We’re really starting to think that Ruben Amorim freezing out Kobbie Mainoo might not have been his smartest decision. But he’s far from alone.",
      "Eddie Howe’s future at Newcastle looks more doubtful than ever before but when would the club actually decide to sack him?"

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Manchester United) – £45m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",

      "Ruben Amorim criticised individual players, branded the team historically bad, hit out at the academy, needlessly ostracised Kobbie Mainoo, finished 15th, threw a tantrum because he couldn’t sign Emiliano Martinez, lost to Grimsby, lost to everyone, generally sacrificed everything in the name of an unworkably rigid system and style, lost a final to actual Tottenham and, most unforgivably of all, questioned the omnipotence of Jason Wilcox.",
      "But for all the damage he caused at Manchester United, nothing Amorim did was half as bad as the sackable offence that is Michael Carrick allowing the tiresome haircut grift to persist.",
      "At least the Portuguese never even vaguely teased achieving that seemingly gargantuan feat of stitching together five consecutive wins of association football with a squad assembled at an absurd expense. The most Amorim ever mustered was three; Carrick surpassed that within 24 days of an appointment which can no longer ever be made permanent beyond the end of the season.",
      "After dispatching Manchester City and Arsenal, overcoming Fulham and staring at the clown car crash that is Spurs while driving past at the wheel on his way to a fourth consecutive victory, Carrick has come unstuck at that least adhesive of obstacles: West Ham at the London Stadium.",
      "That is unfair on Nuno Espirito Santo’s rapidly improving team, whose non-coincidental transformation since the arrival of Paco Jemez had another victory snatched away in the fifth minute of a slightly ridiculous stoppage time.",
      "West Ham had defended a well-earned lead with relative ease, barely conceding a single chance of note after Tomas Soucek’s opener in the 50th minute.",
      "Casemiro had a goal disallowed from an exceptional Mainoo cross for a marginal offside, but Manchester United were otherwise entirely familiarly bereft of inspiration against a low block.",
      "Then mild carnage ensued as the hosts decided they might as well try and exploit some of the swathes of space left behind by an increasingly desperate team.",
      "Callum Wilson led two breaks and should have scored from at least one. Adama Traore had a chance to end things on the counter. Joshua Zirkzee almost scored from a Bruno Fernandes cross. Benjamin Sesko very much did, expertly diverting a Bryan Mbeumo delivery into the only corner of the net Mads Hermansen would have been unable to reach in time.",
      "It was a game played on West Ham’s terms, but also on the condition that Manchester United could introduce more than £100m worth of strikers from the bench to have the desired impact, because up to that point they had tried nothing and were all out of ideas.",
      "That in itself is one of the more basic ticks against Carrick’s name: when chasing a result he shifted to three at the back, but only swapped one of his centre-halves – due to injury – and brought on two strikers, one for a full-back.",
      "The worst performance he has ever overseen as a break-glass-and-phone-Fergie-in-case-of-emergency Manchester United manager still delivered a point.",
      "The bar against which he is judged remains painfully low, but this was an entirely fine point away at a team which has discovered a blueprint more than capable of securing survival.",
      "This West Ham side will not go down playing like this, especially while Nottingham Forest and Spurs display clear symptoms of post-Ange stress disorder by wedding themselves so inexorably to the Australian’s failing successors.",
      "The Hammers, of all teams, will not subscribe to the Too Good To Go Down school of thought even with Jarrod Bowen, Mateus Fernandes and Crysencio Summerville in their ranks. But when they are in direct competition for positions with teams Too Bad To Stay Up, it is difficult to envisage a fall into the Championship.",
      "Had they held on it would not have been undeserved, but Manchester United’s equaliser came on merit too.",

      "We’re starting to think that banishing Kobbie Mainoo from the Man Utd starting XI might not have been the smartest move the very stubborn Ruben Amorim made during his ill-starred reign at Old Trafford.",
      "But it’s not the only pig-headed foolishness to engulf the Premier League this season. It’s one of precisely five pig-headed foolishnesses to engulf the Premier League this season.",
      "And these are they.",
      "",
      "The numbers are hilariously stark.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo started none of Manchester United’s first 21 Premier League games this season, of which they won only eight.",
      "He has started all four of Manchester United’s last four Premier League games, of which they have won all four.",
      "Mainoo has already played more Premier League minutes this season for Michael Carrick than he did for Ruben Amorim. The longest appearance with which he was trusted by the former boss was a whole second half against Burnley in August when he replaced the injured Mason Mount at the break.",
      "Other than that, he subsisted on cameos. Thirteen minutes here. Seven minutes there. Twenty-four minutes against Brentford if he was lucky.",
      "It never really made a lot of sense, especially as a) United’s results were frequently cack and b) their midfield was a notable point of weakness with Manuel Ugarte struggling and Casemiro still often playing from (an admittedly impressive) memory.",
      "Had Amorim not gone up in flames and torched himself out of the Man United job, it’s likely Mainoo wouldn’t even be at United right now. He’d be off on loan somewhere in Serie A or Ligue 1 or some other such indignity.",
      "Instead, he’s been perhaps the key ingredient in Michael Carrick’s astonishing straightforward United revolution in which his masterplan has, distilled to its essence, involved picking his best available players in their best positions.",
      "It always sounds like a back-handed compliment when put like that, but it really isn’t. The fact what Carrick has done looks simple and obvious isn’t his fault; he deserves credit for spotting that overcomplication was the problem here and seeking to remedy it.",
      "But watching Mainoo get better with every passing post-Amorim game, to the point on Saturday lunchtime when he was effortlessly running the game against an admittedly awful and self-sabotaging Spurs, it was impossible not to feel that all of it just damns Amorim entirely.",
      "United fans should at least be grateful that Amorim huffed his way out of the job before it was all too late. Thomas Tuchel probably feels similarly.",
      "",
      "In a rare moment of foresight, we saw this one coming. The way Forest ended last season. The way Mr Marinakis spent the summer bristling with main character energy over the European competition saga and the Morgan Gibbs-White saga and winning out in both those sagas always spelled trouble for Nuno.",
      "Anything other than a fast start to the season was going to see Mr Marinakis search once again for that unmatchable high of being front and centre in everything.",
      "An opening-day win over Brentford sent entirely misleading signals about both teams’ trajectories, but it mattered not. The die had been cast over the closing months of 24/25 and the summer, despite Nuno signing a new contract in June.",
      "Two winless games and further disgruntlement and disagreement over transfer dealings and more was all it took. Nuno didn’t survive the first interlull of the season, and was replaced by Ange Postecoglou in Mr Marinakis’ second refusal to accept the objective reality of the world around him.",
      "He does score some points for at least wising up to that one pretty quick-smart and taking his Dycheball medicine.",
      "But it could all still end in relegation and has already led to a needless squandering of so much progress, momentum and goodwill built up last season.",
      "",
      "We’re tempted to include Frank himself and the media here, because while Spurs fans have been noisily sh*tting themselves for several weeks now it really does only now seem to have hit home with some that this is a club on its arse and facing a very real relegation battle for which it seems ill-suited and entirely unprepared.",
      "Matt Law in today’s Telegraph has breathlessly declared that if Spurs don’t beat Newcastle tonight they might ‘soon’ have to accept relegation is a realistic prospect. If by ‘soon’ he in fact means several weeks ago, perhaps during a window in which it is possible to procure more players for a squad ravaged by injuries and its own stupidity, then he’s absolutely bang on.",
      "Spurs have won two Premier League games since October. We really aren’t at all sure how the reality that has been clear for so long is only now sneaking up on Frank’s adoring media fanboys.",
      "He’s also spent at least the last two months talking complete and utter bollocks about windmills and encouraging performances and saying things like “if you keep the ball out of the net then you have a better chance of winning” to nods of appreciation from the waiting press pack.",
      "We don’t know how he’s fooled them, but we have a better idea about how he’s fooled the new broom at Spurs. Because the people now in day-to-day charge of a post-Levy Spurs appear to be – and we don’t wish to be unkind here – idiots, nepo-babies and fools.",
      "They had their wallets thoroughly inspected by Fabio Paratici, who was supposed to be staying on at Spurs for the rest of the January transfer window (no further signings) before starting his new job at Fiorentina (five further signings).",
      "We’ve already seen this season that on-field results can be truly catastrophic without bothering big-club suits, as long as you’re willing to accept your place and not speak out. Neither Ruben Amorim nor Enzo Maresca can have too many complaints about being cast out by United and Chelsea, but the offences that ultimately did for them were incredibly small and twatty.",
      "Frank has cast an increasingly foolish figure this season, frequently not on top of his brief in press conferences at all, failing to spot he was using an Arsenal-branded coffee cup at Bournemouth and, yes, just saying increasingly stupid things.",
      "But he’s smart enough never to criticise the fragile egos of the clown-car operation now in charge of this football club.",
      "The extraordinary thing isn’t that Spurs could very possibly get relegated; the extraordinary thing is that they’ve done absolutely nothing to address a prospect that has grown alarmingly more real with every passing game.",
      "We’ve stopped even calling Spurs games El Sackicos now. We don’t even think defeat to Newcastle tonight would be enough. Nor would defeat to Arsenal in their next league game.",
      "We’re not even certain that dropping into the bottom three itself – a prospect that is now just three games away – would do it.",

      "",
      "Can Dominik Szoboszlai play right-back? Yes. Should Dominik Szoboszlai play right-back? Ideally no.",
      "He’s an excellent footballer and, like many excellent footballers, he is capable of doing a serviceable job in an unfamiliar position.",
      "But it’s become far too much of a go-to option for an increasingly unmoored Arne Slot in an increasingly strife-addled Liverpool season.",
      "There’s a real sense here of Slot trying to bottle lightning, trying to recapture something that has been lost.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold was brilliant at being a right-back-cum-playmaker so it’s understandable for Slot to try and recreate that magic by putting another supremely talented playmaker there.",
      "But it really isn’t that simple. If it was, then everyone would do it.",
      "The situation came to a head, of course, on Sunday. But this has all been brewing up for some time now.",
      "Slot’s hand has been forced slightly by a shortage of available options, but crowbarring a very capable attacking midfielder into the right-back role has been a double victory for silliness, lessening Liverpool’s attacking capabilities while increasing defensive vulnerability.",
      "Sure, being right-back doesn’t stop him treating 30-yard free-kicks as penalties and that’s all well and good until he’s caught out of position to play everyone onside for an equaliser before brainlessly getting himself suspended to prevent a goal that was never going to matter.",
      "He has at least turned a few more people against VAR, so it wasn’t a complete waste. But playing him at right-back absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Palace were right to put their foot down at the end of the summer transfer window and tell Liverpool ‘Sorry, time’s up’ when they came knocking late for Guehi having been distracted for far too long by the shinier if far less necessary Alexander Isak.",
      "Palace’s mistake was in then burying their heads in the sane for the next four months and acting surprised when Glasner was pissed off at the lack of support he and his team were receiving from above.",
      "There are limits to what Palace can do. They were never going to keep Glasner forever any more than they were going to be able to keep Guehi. But for reasons inside and outside their control they have let a once-in-a-lifetime breakthrough season shatter into nothingness, and that all feels a bit unnecessary and careless.",
      "Maybe signing Brennan Johnson and Jorgen Strand Larsen with their three Premier League goals for fellow relegation battlers will solve everything in the end. But we have some doubts.",
      "This is the season of Premier League bosses being told they’re ‘getting sacked in the morning’. But Thomas Frank, Sean Dyche and friends should make it to lunch.",
      "At least Ruben Amorim never even vaguely teased he might string together five wins. Michael Carrick should be ashamed for taking Manchester United close",
      "Eddie Howe’s future at Newcastle looks more doubtful than ever before but when would the club actually decide to sack him?",
      "It’s been the greatest grift in football content history but it has to end now. It’s bigger than the World Cup, apparently.",
      "Arne Slot no longer has any defenders…at Liverpool or otherwise. It’s now just a matter of time before he is sacked.",
      "Some are excelling in jobs they were lucky to get, others stinking the place out in jobs they are lucky to retain, and they amount to half the current Premier ..."

      "It has been almost exactly three years since Manchester United wanted it known that they were adopting a ‘no dickheads policy’ as a consequence, we can only assume, of something Richard Arnold saw on LinkedIn.",
      "Generally, if you have to spell out such a mandate, you’ve already got a problem. And United certainly did. On the basis of it taking one to know one, the Red Devils should have seen them coming a mile off and, this far down the road, there ought not to be a dickhead in sight.",
      "For the most part, United have weeded them out. The tricky part was not swerving the temptation to recruit more dickheads, but dealing with the dickheads already in their midst.",
      "Defining a dickhead is tricky indeed. Many of those who bang on about dickheads in a professional sport or corporate environment tend to be, well, dickheads.",
      "What Arnold probably encountered during his doomscroll was something inspired by ex-All Blacks mental skills coach Gilbert Enoka, who more than a decade ago characterised dickheads as “people who out themselves ahead of the team, people who think they’re entitled to things or expect the rules to be different for them, people operating deceitfully in the dark, or being unnecessarily loud about their work”.",
      "Enoka, by the way, was last seen working with England’s Ashes squad in Australia, seemingly proving you can’t help them all.",
      "Give Ruben Amorim his dues, though; the ex-United manager might struggle to recognise a functioning game plan but he could pin a dickhead and, if he achieved nothing else – he didn’t – at least last summer he made four of them another club’s problem, if only for a season.",
      "That isn’t to say that the United dressing room is a dickhead-free zone. And nor should it be. All of United’s greatest teams and many of their best-ever players had a bit of the dick about them. But these were dickheads who delivered. It is the dickheads that don’t deliver who must be dodged.",
      "Which brings us to Cristian Romero.",
      "Paul Scholes, like many whose dickhead era really began when he became a podcaster, would ‘love’ United to sign the Tottenham Hotspur captain, fresh off his red card at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "“Do you know what? I love him. I love watching him play football.",
      "“He’s pissed off at Spurs, isn’t he? He doesn’t want to be there. He’s having a go at the crowd, he’s having a go at the board, I think his head has checked out a little bit. But I would love him at Manchester United. I just love his character.”",
      "We love Romero too. He’s great, isn’t he? And what’s most great about him is that he’s Tottenham’s problem when – pardon us for mixing our performance cliches – he just can’t control his dickhead chimp.",
      "The door to that cage was ripped off its hinges on Saturday, when Romero was sent off less than half an hour into Spurs’ defeat to United. His timing, of the tackle and the act itself, was just awful for all involved.",
      "Romero, as Scholes alluded, spent much of the build-up to a big game for Spurs having a pop at his paymasters. You can question his channel of choice, but he made some very fair points. Indeed, in the 29 minutes the captain spent before them, the Spurs fans sang ‘Romero’s right, the board are sh*te’ to endorse his message.",
      "Then Romero completely undermined his own authority by acting the dickhead, putting his studs through Casemiro’s ankle to leave his manager even deeper in the sh*t. And Thomas Frank was already drowning in it.",
      "Frank went out to bat for his captain in the aftermath of a defeat that leaves Tottenham on the same points as relegation battlers. Maybe it’s only a battle if you acknowledge it. Spurs, last year, just chucked in the league season, correctly assuming everyone else was terrible enough that they need not bother. Alarmingly, this season they are actually trying, but so is everyone else.",
      "That doesn’t appear to be of great concern to Romero because, as Scholes points out, the captain has already checked out. Which is sure to have ramifications for Spurs and Frank. And it should when it comes to Romero’s options this summer.",
      "For the sake of whoever is their manager next season, United cannot be among those suitors, in part because of the reasons Scholes himself listed.",
      "The temptation is understandable. Romero is a very, very good central defender with a handy knack in both boxes. And, despite all the evidence to the contrary, Frank says his captain is a ‘young leader’ who will learn.",
      "He’s not catching on quick, though, is he? Romero will be 28 by the start of next season having been a senior pro for a decade, half of which has been spent at Spurs, with 250-plus appearances across Serie A and the Premier League. He has been a World Cup winner for four years and will go to the United States in June with a half-century of Argentina caps.",
      "The penny really ought to have dropped by now.",
      "United, often for the wrong reasons, by now have too much previous when it comes to waiting for expensive dickheads to reform, so they should recognise trouble when they see it in Romero.",
      "He is not a gamble United need to take. They already have one hot-headed Argentina centre-back and partners for Lisandro Martinez are not currently in short supply.",
      "From Romero’s perspective too, it is not a move that makes sense. If the scrutiny at Spurs is a driver in his dickishness, where might the spotlight at United lead him?",
      "Romero is also being linked with Atletico Madrid and, oh yes, that’s the stuff. Diego Simone and Atletico could be perfect for Romero. And if not, it will be even more spectacular still. We will find out what happens when an unstoppable dickhead meets an immovable dickhead.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid have ‘decided’ to turn to Tottenham Hotspur star Cristian Romero, who is preferred over a ‘ruled out’ Liverpool man.",

      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero is ‘hot-headed and impulsive’ – so who should Thomas Frank pass the armband on to? Richarlison…obviously.",
      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",

      "In one of our increasingly frequent laments at the state of Premier League management, it occurred to us that half the current Premier League managers are lucky to have the jobs they have.",
      "There are all manner of different categories here. Some of these managers are sh*t, some are over-promoted, some are clearly still in what is for now nominally a Premier League job in the hope they’ll do a good job in the Championship next season, some just happened to be in the right place at the right time when the job was being dished out.",
      "And some of them are Thomas Frank, who is almost all of the above but don’t tell the UK press boys that because he is like Bambi to those lads for some reason.",
      "To be entirely clear from the outset: while some of these managers are absolutely here for being sh*t, many of these managers are very good managers doing very good jobs. They just find themselves in positions their CVs from a year ago couldn’t possibly justify.",
      "",
      "He’s had quite the managerial career already at 43. Took Luton into the Premier League, which was crazy, then took them back out of it, which was fair enough, then had them well on their way to League One (crazy again) before being removed.",
      "You kind of felt he was always coming back to the Premier League one way or another, but it did probably need more than being quite good for a few months with Middlesbrough.",
      "He got himself the cushiest Premier League gig imaginable; taking over a team already doomed to relegation that won’t get pinned on you, and a situation where you are almost guaranteed to improve things.",
      "This he has duly done by collecting six points in 14 games. Obviously appointed with next season in mind, which is fair enough but history does suggest that while it’s fair to assume he will get Wolves out of the Championship, which direction is a 50-50 chance.",
      "",
      "A slightly harsher version of the ‘only here for next season’ trope, because Parker did at least earn his way into the Premier League with Burnley. And he has a proven Championship track record now.",
      "But does appear to have spent this season focusing on doing just enough to keep himself in position for another crack at his specialist subject rather than bypassing the need for another promotion attempt altogether.",
      "We all know that players exist who are too good for the Championship but nowhere near it in the Premier League, so it stands to reason it should apply to managers as well. Which could make for an interesting career, permanently either becoming a victim of your own success or rewarded for your own failure.",
      "",
      "It’s probably fair enough that consistent punching above weight at a smaller club should eventually earn a manager a crack at a big job.",
      "But it’s also fair enough that when, after just a few months, it’s clear that a) the job has overwhelmed you and you are drowning in your own nonsense and that b) the smaller club have carried on punching quite merrily without you, it’s time to agree that, sure, it was worth finding out, but find out we have and let’s bring an end to the whole thing.",
      "When it’s been eight months and that manager is actively propelling the big club towards relegation, then it is definitely time.",
      "Look we all know Daniel Levy had his faults, but he wouldn’t have stood for this nonsense like the bumbling suits who have replaced him. He wouldn’t have learned any lessons from it either, sure, but he would have P45ed this small-timing, out-of-his-depth, anti-football-enjoying fraud into the shadow realm months ago and Spurs would now be becalmed and miserable but safe in 11th under the club-understanding interim eye of Ryan Mason.",
      "",
      "Anyone fumbling a big job at the moment has a bullsh*t-chatting canary down the mine in Thomas Frank, but that shouldn’t keep the attention off your Slots and Howes entirely.",
      "Howe’s big problem is that Newcastle can and do have more money than God but just don’t have the pull – or, irritating as this point always is – the location of the established big clubs. Even without pesky rules also thwarting plans for world domination, it would still be a struggle. So it’s desperately hard for him to achieve what Newcastle want to achieve.",
      "Howe’s bigger problem is that if all those other things just disappeared and it was possible to achieve world domination, he would no longer be the manager anyway.",
      "His humdrum day-to-day problem is that he has proved thoroughly incapable of knitting together two good seasons in a row.",
      "Howe’s Newcastle can qualify for the Champions League, or Howe’s Newcastle can be in the Champions League. But never the twain shall meet.",
      "READ: Six tables to highlight why Eddie Howe is facing Newcastle sack",
      "",
      "Not really fair, is it? To say that someone who won the league title just nine months ago doesn’t deserve to be in his job? Of course it’s not fair. Doesn’t mean it’s not true, though, and Slot has entirely f*cked it this season.",
      "You can’t go around winning the league and having an entire fanbase and punditocracy declaring the dawn of a glorious new era of Liverpool dominance, drop half a billion quid on transfers only some of which you needed, and then spend the next season looking like you might not even qualify for the Champions League while pretending not being as cartoonishly dreadful as Spurs is enough.",
      "Slot’s tactics have been questionable, and he’s found it far harder to incorporate his own signings into the squad than he did simply working with what he was left by Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It was always the key question after last season. Was it, as Liverpool and their media supporters hoped and believed, the start of something new or merely the last hurrah of the Klopp era but just with a baldman at the helm.",
      "And now we know.",
      "",
      "As Thomas Frank has discovered, the big difference between big-club and small-club management is not the expectation or the pressure or the standards. It’s the attention. There is no escape and no hiding place.",
      "If you go around winning just two of 16 games as Brentford boss and talk about ‘improved performances’ after losing to teams who haven’t won in months and saying things like ‘if you keep the ball out of the net then you have a better chance of winning’ nobody gives a flying f*ck.",
      "Do it at Spurs and, well, in his case you still kind of get away with it because for some reason he is like Bambi to the stout gentlemen of the fourth estate. But people notice is the point.",
      "Until Brighton served up an absolute turd of a Super Sunday appetiser ahead of Liverpool-City at the weekend, nobody up to and including Fabian Hurzeler himself appeared to have realised Brighton hadn’t won a Premier League game other than a 2-0 home win over Burnley since November.",
      "This is not the season one wants to find oneself drifting aimlessly towards the very real fight to avoid the third and final relegation spot. Which makes it weird that so many teams seem to want to do precisely that.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: ‘Angry’ Howe in busy sack race while Arsenal force more rule changes",
      "",
      "The places you can end up as a football club when you have a lunatic for an owner and accidentally put Ange Postecoglou in charge of the most ill-suited squad imaginable for six weeks.",
      "Dyche has done a perfectly serviceable job at Forest, resuscitating both Premier and Europa League campaigns to which Postecoglou was doing terminal damage.",
      "It will very rarely be pretty but he will probably keep Forest up. Fair enough. But it is nevertheless mad that another club managed to get itself in a sufficient pickle in the year of someone’s lord 2025 to hand the great man another chance at tweaking some Barclays noses and issuing gravel-throated proclamations about utter woke nonsense.",
      "",
      "Doing brilliant work once you’re in the job doesn’t mean you weren’t still lucky to get it. Carrick is the ultimate DNA appointment, whose undoubted effectiveness comes in large part due to his predecessor having whatever the opposite of club DNA is.",
      "Much of Carrick’s success has been built on righting the obvious wrongs Ruben Amorim was too stubborn to notice or correct. That’s not to knock the (for now) interim manager, but it’s increasingly clear with every passing moment that refusing to pick Kobbie Mainoo for reasons that were small and twatty should have been enough alone to have Amorim sacked and probably deemed in breach of contract for gross negligence.",
      "Carrick has done brilliantly, even if the real quiz comes if/when he’s handed the permanent job, but none of that alters the fact that United would not have looked at the former Middlesbrough manager twice were it not for his storied Old Trafford playing career.",
      "Indeed, we’re not sure any Premier League team outside his other crisis-addled former clubs West Ham and Spurs would have done so.",
      "",
      "Finds himself competing with Mikel Arteta and Regis Le Bris for manager of the year honours having lifted a relegation-tipped Brentford team that appeared to have lost everything in the summer to the European battle, sitting a single goal behind champions Liverpool after 25 games and a full 10 points clear of their former manager’s new squeeze.",
      "Andrews, clearly, has the right stuff and is doing a wonderful job. But the credentials with which he got that job remain staggeringly slight. Brentford deserve huge credit for the lemonade they have made from life’s lemons, but it really was a monumental gamble to entrust their Premier League survival to a man who had never managed a single game of senior football and had only even been a Premier League coach for a single season, working as Thomas Frank’s set-piece coach.",
      "Watching Tottenham play what is still we suppose technically association football this season, it occurs to us that set-piece coach might actually be Frank’s true calling. Maybe Andrews can give him a gig next year.",
      "",
      "Right-place-at-the-right-timing your way into the Brentford job is one thing, but parachuting yourself into the Chelsea job that way is quite another.",
      "Especially when, in the most modern football way imaginable, the right place to be to get fast-tracked into an elite Premier League job is in fact on the banks of the Rhine on the France-Germany border.",
      "We have reached a tipping point here, haven’t we? Club DNA was one thing. Knowing The Club was one thing. We’re now firmly in the territory of Multi-Club Football Group DNA, of nodding and going, ‘See, this guy just gets this Multi-Club Football Group’ despite your only permanent managerial gig before joining that shadowy organisation being the six months you spent not quite getting Hull City into the play-offs.",
      "But when you’re as accomplished an ager of men as Rosenior, these are the things that happen for you.",
      "Arne Slot looks pretty doomed at Liverpool, but he will not be short of options if/when he is sacked by FSG. Spurs or Real Madrid could be next…",
      "This is the season of Premier League bosses being told they’re ‘getting sacked in the morning’. But Thomas Frank, Sean Dyche and friends should make it to lunch.",
      "At least Ruben Amorim never even vaguely teased he might string together five wins. Michael Carrick should be ashamed for taking Manchester United close",
      "Tottenham Hotspur boss Thomas Frank has insisted that he will remain in charge of the Premier League giants after Tuesday’s loss against Newcastle United.",
      "Spurs continue to slide closer and closer to relegation yet still Thomas Frank remains in charge. Surely it can’t last much longer. Can it?",
      "We’re really starting to think that Ruben Amorim freezing out Kobbie Mainoo might not have been his smartest decision. But he’s far from alone."

      "It’s Eddie Howe vs Thomas Frank in El Sackico, while the visit of Leeds to Stamford Bridge offers the opportunity for an imperfect but stark comparison between Liam Rosenior and his predecessor.",
      "Meanwhile, Evangelos Marinakis will surely welcome a fourth Nottingham Forest boss should Sean Dyche lose to Wolves and will Kobbie Mainoo finally have a bad game? Almost certainly not.",
      "",
      "We wonder if defeat to a 15th-placed Tottenham side sliding into a relegation battle after two wins in 16 games might be enough for Eddie Howe to believe he is in fact not the right man for the job after insisting he would “step aside” if he believed that to be the case.",
      "Aston Villa and Liverpool are acceptable defeats, Brentford at St James’ Park less so; add that run of three losses to another one against Thomas Frank’s Tottenham and most of the remaining #HoweIn Toon fans would surely turn against a manager who undoubtedly has a difficult job in manoeuvring a shallow squad to compete on what was four fronts until last week, but is also definitely now failing to get anything close to the best out of the vast majority of his players.",
      "The tide Howe is fighting against has already swept Frank out to sea. Are there any Tottenham fans who still want him to manage their team? At some point soon they will stop feeling angry and start feeling sympathy for a man arguably the worst football club to be told ‘you’re out of your depth’ at: one that purports to be Big with neither the back catalogue of successes nor the player quality to make it so.",
      "",
      "Four wins from four in the Premier League, through to the Champions League last 16 after getting the better of one of the old-guard Chelsea managers, Cole Palmer back and breaking records, it’s going about as well as it could have done for Liam Rosenior. Even his negative, ineffective tactics in defeat to Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final were reported by many as a masterstroke that wasn’t.",
      "Enzo Maresca will be among the critics looking at a run of Brentford, Crystal Palace, West Ham and Wolves and brushing off the winning as a par score – although Chelsea drew with Brentford and Palace under the Italian earlier in the season – and likely view upcoming clashes against Leeds and Burnley with similar disdain.",
      "Leeds are a vastly different proposition at home than they are away – Daniel Farke’s have picked up 22 of their 29 points at Elland Road this season – granting the Rosenior naysayers further opportunity to scoff should Chelsea beat them at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.",
      "But the 3-1 defeat to the Whites at the start of December was maybe the low point of Maresca’s reign. As Gary Neville said on a night when Maresca rang the changes to his cost, Chelsea were “beaten up” and looked to lack anything close to the “character” – maybe the Rosenior buzzword – that they’ve shown in spades under the new manager.",
      "A victory in which Chelsea display the new-found grit and determination so absent two months ago will offer opportunity for an imperfect but stark comparison between Rosenior and his predecessor.",
      "We’re backing that victory.",
      "",
      "A man who has somehow managed to carve out a niche for himself as one of the last remaining Premier League relegation-battle specialists is leading Nottingham Forest towards the drop after being sacked by Everton for doing the very same thing.",
      "Eight points from the last five games is a perfectly reasonable return in the dogfight but four defeats on the bounce before that and West Ham’s remarkable uptick in form has left Forest in a precarious position, three points above the relegation zone.",
      "Dyche is now facing the wrath of a group of fans, the majority of whom didn’t want him in the first place,  who didn’t take kindly to the stark difference in vibe felt between their football club and Leeds after Farke’s side brushed them aside last time out.",
      "Growing frustration will surely turn to all-out mutiny should they fail to beat rock-bottom Wolves at home on Wednesday and grant Evangelos Marinakis an opportunity to appoint his fourth permanent manager of the season which we fully expect him to grasp with both hands.",
      "",
      "We find ourselves agreeing with Owen Hargreaves more than most pundits these days – certainly the ones with a Manchester United bent -and couldn’t think of any specific retorts to his claim that he’s “never seen Mainoo have a bad game”.",
      "He got a tad carried away in then suggesting the 20-year-old is some sort of George Best regen, but we’re happy to excuse his excesses as we too often fail to avoid hyperbole when watching the Red Devils academy graduate glide across the pitch as he has done since Prince Carrick arrived to break him from the dungeon master’s chains.",
      "What a fool Ruben Amorim is. And our frustration in him denying Mainoo football will turn to fury if he’s ruined his chances of appearing for England at the World Cup. Here’s hoping his performances continue to be at a level where Thomas Tuchel – for all of his faith in the tried and tested players for England – has no choice but to select him.",
      "West Ham’s Mateus Fernandes will provide a decent test, but we fully expect Mainoo to stroll through the game as he has done with all others.",
      "",
      "Eric Ramsay has failed to revert the Baggies slide towards League One after replacing Ryan Mason at the helm at the start of last month. He’s failed to win any of his five games in charge, losing three of them to leave a football club which hasn’t been out of the top two divisions since 1993 circling the Championship drain.",
      "They’re now just one point above the relegation zone and face a Birmingham side making a push for the play-offs and consecutive promotions after three wins and a draw in their last six, featuring a victory over league-leaders Coventry City.",

      "Newcastle United are said to be ‘well-placed’ to re-sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest in the summer, but the reality is very different…",
      "Newcastle‘s recent transfer activity is proof that money can’t buy you happiness, with Eddie Howe’s side derailed by Profit & Sustainability rules and their superior Premier League rivals in recent months.",
      "Their 2025 summer transfer window was shambolic from start to finish, with the prolonged Alexander Isak setting the tone for an incredibly frustrating few months.",
      "Wantaway Isak lingered around like a bad smell until deadline day, with the Magpies risking missing out on a remarkable full XI of potential signings before overpaying to sign Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa.",

      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: ‘Angry’ Howe in busy sack race while Arsenal force more rule changes",
      "Howe has commented on potentially “stepping down” as Newcastle have only won one of their last nine games, while it is looking increasingly likely that Sandro Tonali is going to leave after his agent clearly tried to get him a move in January.",
      "But former Premier League chief executive Keith Wyness foolishly thinks Newcastle are ‘well-placed to agree a deal’ to re-sign Anderson to replace Tonali in a ‘sensational twist’.",
      "“Well that’s exactly it, it’s having that succession plan ready now in terms of midfield, but you know I think that they’re actually pretty well-placed [to sign Anderson],” Wyness told Football Insider.",
      "“It’d be surprising what they might have to pay to bring Elliot Anderson back having filled that gap. But again, they’re stuck in this whole vice we talked about last week of the SCR formulas and the ability to spend, despite having the richest owners in the world. It’s all been rehearsed and talked about so much, and it seems so unfair.",
      "“But yes, they’ve got to find that midfield solution now. This is why clubs don’t like players moving in January. It does give them this period now to do the research and to get some time in.",
      "“But, I think that certainly if he was to go, at the right price, I think Newcastle and Eddie Howe wouldn’t mind actually refreshing the squad and the ages in that midfield and get things moving again.",
      "“They’ve still got some work to do in that squad in Newcastle, certainly I think at both ends of the pitch and in the midfield. So I think that that would be something they need to address. But I think they’ve got to start thinking about life without Tonali for sure.”",
      "Anderson’s affiliation with Newcastle as a former academy product gives them a helping hand for a potential return, but they still have very little chance of beating Man Utd or Man City to the £100m-rated ‘Manchester-bound’ star.",
      "Last summer made it clear where the Magpies, despite their vast wealth, stand in the pecking order, as they were beaten to priority signings by Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, and Tottenham, and the events of this season mean they are no more likely to pull off coups this summer.",
      "They simply do not have the same pull as the traditional Big Six, especially without Champions League football, so Anderson will ultimately end up at Man Utd or City, while fellow £100m-rated midfielder Tonali will inevitably be lured elsewhere too after the seeds of his exit were planted in January.",

I’ve read conclusions, mailboxes, and Lewis Oldham’s recent piece – all rightly praising Carrick placing round pegs in round holes, but it’s much more impressive that just that. On top of deserved wins, they’ve been a quality watch too!",
      "The difference in on-the-ball style of play has been sensational. I was raised on early Wenger-era Arsenal, so I know well what entertaining football looks like, and this is it. I watch entire Utd matches a lot as most of my friends are fans. Recently I’ve enjoyed watching the calamity, but a strong and entertaining United is good for the league. Only crap part is now having to listen to your Nevilles and Ferdinands spout shite about it being Fergie’s blueprint (let the man go, lads).",

      "The intensity and interchanging of Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno and Amad has opened new doors and new ideas. The incisive passing from the spine of this Utd team is clearly an instruction that brings a welcome risk-taking element that is now almost entirely absent from the City/Liverpool/Arsenal contingent who only appear to encourage creativity in the last 20 yards of the pitch. Seeing Maguire, Dalot, Casemiro (!) and Martinez play 1-2s out of the back and flick touches into the path of penetrating teammates has been brilliant.",
      "There’s an unpredictability about this group when they have the ball. Look at some of the chances they’ve created and one-touch football that’s been on show in the entire opposition half (and even their own half at times!). It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s effective. It also gets the fans on your side. Best about it though is that the players who looked so shite under previous managers are now seemingly having more fun playing with less “structure”. If this continues, don’t be surprised if the players go to the top dogs and ask for him permanently. The thought of a Nagelsmann or otherwise being appointed to input their system on a group of players absolutely flying under a trusting manager might be met with a little derision.",

Firstly, the order of events: Szoboszlai fouls Haaland, the ref plays advantage and then Haaland fouls Szoboslai, so the goal is disallowed. Why did City then get the resulting free kick? Surely you don’t get a free hit on an opponent just because the ref has given you advantage? The second foul must be penalised, the game has continued.",
      "Also, it seems nuts, but don’t the laws of the game say Szoboszlai should have been cautioned, not sent off, because of the advantage:",
      "If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.",
      "Purely on a technical basis, it looks like the ref was wrong to allow the goal initially, VAR could only disallow the goal, and should have reviewed and prevented Szobo’s sending off, too. Then Liverpool should have had a free in the last 15 seconds, where they could’ve lumped it up-field to 10 men in the box, and dramatically cocked up a final chance to draw level.\nDave (this is what football analysis should be), Wigan",

This is not sour grapes (it is partially) but my god that was one of the worst officiated games I’ve ever seen.",
      "Firstly, Silva’s tug on Salah’s shoulder, when is a foul not a foul? Neville says that Silva is “clever” as he doesn’t pull Salah for “too long”, or put another way, he fouls him but grets away with it. Don’t get me wrong, Liverpool players are just as guilty as any other team when it comes to this type of offence, Konate on Marmoush is less obvious but is in the realm, so just give them!, It’s the only way to (try and) cut them out. Trippiers pull on Potter was worse and yet the VAR, despite the shirt clearly being pulled, deems it “insignificant contact”!!!! To repeat my comment from a couple of weeks ago, show me the rule where it says a shirt pull is allowed and I’ll shut up about it.",
      "Guehi’s foul on Salah, correctly given outside the box but will Dias stop Salah getting a shot off, i.e. a goal scoring opportunity, he won’t, last season’s Salah scores, this season’s hits it with the outside of his foot and it goes closer to the corner flag than the goal, but it is still an opportunity.",
      "The penalty, it’s a penalty, some are claiming “but the ball is out of play”, again show me a rule that says you can wipe a player out after the ball has gone and I’ll agree, don’t give “a coming together” either, Alisson is late.",
      "Bernardo Silva, a wonderful player but is is there a more odious little shit in the game? Clearly Rodri’s cloak of invisibility has been passed to him. I was convinced he’d already been booked so was amazed to see him not sent off. His challenge on Kerkez sums up another massive flaw in the application or context of “the laws”.",
      "It’s as cynical a challenge as you will ever see, it’s not “endangering an opponent”, it’s not “reckless”, as such, a red card cannot be issued, but what it actually does is give City more than one advantage. It has broke up an attack. it wastes valuable seconds as the time to take the free kick will not be added on and it allows City to organise and set themselves for the free kick. red cards for this would again go some way to stopping them.",
      "Finally we have the biggest clusterf**k, the Cherki “goal”, how on earth is denying a goal scoring opportunity relevant when the ball goes in the net anyway, unfortunately for everyone, the laws of the game are applied correctly, almost, but the referee gives the goal, what happened to sticking with the on field decision? I’m pretty sure, but not certain, that “goals” have bee overruled and a penalty awarded, allowing the defending team an opportunity to stop a goal being scored, madness.",
      "I say almost as there was one element which was totally ignored! Haaland’s rugby tackle is a yellow card every time, Alisson is yellow carded for his challenge for the penalty yet Haaland is not, he’s not even late, he jumps on Szboszlai with no attempt to get to the ball (well he might be, but still).",
      "One commentor (btl really is filled with numpties) said that adding “the best part of quarter of an hour on”, was to give Liverpool more time, as they have conceded more “added on time” goals than anyone else, it’s hard to see how this was to their advantage.",
      "On the game itself, a draw felt like a fairer result, other than Haaland’s chance early on, Liverpool missed the “easier” chances with Ekitike’s header and Wirtz’s weak effort. I remember Semenyo blasting one high and wide and a decent shot from outside the box, but can’t recall Alissons other “saves” whereas Donnarumma’s is recalled by everyone, I know, “it’s his job” and that’s what the best keepers pull out.",
      "All in all a game in which Liverpool once again shot themselves in the foot, but well done City, a vital win but I don’t see them catching Arsenal.\nHoward (Maguire should have had a penalty also) Jones",
      "",
      "Surprised to see nothing here or anywhere else in regarding the foul from Reinildo on Gyokeres as he scored his second goal. Flying challenge above the knee with absolutely no hope of getting the ball. These only seem to be punished with a red if there is a big injury (like Isak’s leg break). A truly awful decision.",
      "But for luck it could have been another Abou Diaby moment 20 years on; the needless tackle right at the end of the match, when a team is clearly beaten and also against Sunderland.",

The year after they’re owning Liverpool, the year after that going unbeaten at The Lane. But this is where the lack of investment starts to creep in. The cloak of fiscal responsibility means they don’t sign a player in a calendar year. When they do take their hand off the cheque book, they absolutely soil themselves – they have no idea how to spend the money they’ve hoarded – Lo Celso and Ndombele were meant to be Mane and Firmino. The rot is setting in. The painful rebuild is never faced up too.",

They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "Arne Slot looks pretty doomed at Liverpool, but he will not be short of options if/when he is sacked by FSG. Spurs or Real Madrid could be next…",
      "This is the season of Premier League bosses being told they’re ‘getting sacked in the morning’. But Thomas Frank, Sean Dyche and friends should make it to lunch.",
      "At least Ruben Amorim never even vaguely teased he might string together five wins. Michael Carrick should be ashamed for taking Manchester United close",
      "We’re really starting to think that Ruben Amorim freezing out Kobbie Mainoo might not have been his smartest decision. But he’s far from alone.",
      "Eddie Howe’s future at Newcastle looks more doubtful than ever before but when would the club actually decide to sack him?",
      "It’s been the greatest grift in football content history but it has to end now. It’s bigger than the World Cup, apparently."

He has the second-worst PPG of any coach to have overseen at least 50 Premier League games, beating only Rob Edwards, who voluntarily tanked his own record by taking on the Wolves job.",
      "If he was allowed to transplant his entire Premier League manager career record into the current table, Parker would still sit second and a point behind an Arsenal side which would have 52 games in hand.",
      "Even before last season had concluded, there was discussion as to whether Leeds and Burnley would actually be better off dispensing with the managers who won them promotion to the Premier League, so shambolic were their respective records in the division.",
      "Daniel Farke has shown a level of growth and adaptability previously deemed beyond him; Parker has only reinforced the sense he is not equipped for this challenge.",

      "To repeat a couple of paragraphs from 16 Conclusions:",
      "‘Spurs are not blessed with many particularly saleable assets, or at least players who can command a worthwhile enough fee to cash in on without the entire team falling in on itself.",
      "‘Romero’s cons far outweigh his positives at this point; there are cheaper players out there whose ceilings might be lower, but at least their floors aren’t made of infuriating lava.’",
      "It definitely feels like a timeline exists in which Romero can be the fall guy for a culture reset; Liverpool had one in Mamadou Sakho, Mikel Arteta can point to a handful at Arsenal and Sir Alex Ferguson even built Manchester United on one such dressing-room immolation.",
      "Of course, it is slightly awkward when that sacrifice is the captain and a popular squad figure, while the manager who would be making it sits on a foundation with the structural integrity of custard on water. But the option is there if Spurs dare.",
      "READ: Why is Thomas Frank not being given the full Ange treatment?",
      "",
      "He fundamentally just sounds quite sad now.",
      "Howe’s “I’m obviously not doing my job well enough at the moment, I’m annoyed with myself, angry with myself and blaming myself” moment of self-introspection was stark but also welcome in a division short of such managerial soul-searching.",
      "But it is becoming difficult to shift the idea that both parties might benefit more from a clean break than just ploughing through and hoping things work themselves out.",
      "And his pledge to “step aside” if he felt the players needed a new voice didn’t seem like an empty threat. It was positively Keegan.",
      "",
      "He did call Elland Road one of the more aggressive stadiums “in terms of the modern game”, and “always a tough place to go”. But Dyche said Nottingham Forest had “a good competitive edge” of their own, adding that “the balance feels right at the moment”.",
      "The same could not be said of his team with a right-back in Ola Aina at left-back, a centre-half in Zach Abbott at right-back and a central midfielder in Nico Dominguez on the right wing.",
      "Injuries and suspensions alone cannot account for that degree of square-peg-in-round-holery.",
      "Abbott also might not be particularly grateful for being given a full Premier League debut out of position at such “a tough place to go”, especially when the older and considerably more experienced Luca Netz was left on the bench as “one for the future” who was not yet “ready” for the English game.",
      "Dyche argued that Netz had not been at the club for long enough and “I don’t want to put players out there until they know what to do”, but those he selected in the roles he put them in seemed absolutely oblivious too.",
      "That Dyche made no changes until the game was irretrievably lost at 3-0 down is negligent. Forest had no shots – and a single touch within 20 yards of the opposition goal – between the 45th and the 72nd minutes in what felt like a complete surrender.",
      "The Wolves game in midweek is critical. But with fans already disillusioned and the Championship trapdoor looming ominously, it feels more likely with each match that this awkward, unsatisfying marriage of convenience ends in the summer whether Forest stay up or not.",
      "",
      "Further proof of how febrile it is right now at Liverpool as they equal the record for the most winning goals conceded after the 90th minute in a single Premier League season.",
      "No team has scored more Premier League goals this season after the 81st minute in games than Liverpool’s 11, while only Burnley, Leeds and Newcastle (all 11) have conceded more than their ten.",
      "When almost every game is decided by late drama either way, there is little wonder nothing feels sustainable.",
      "",
      "“What we had this afternoon I think is a good Premier League bench and a bench that can give us solutions for what comes ahead of us,” said Marco Silva.",
      "Fulham might never have had a stronger one. Calvin Bassey, Antonee Robinson, Kenny Tete, Harrison Reed, Josh King, Oscar Bobb, Kevin and Rodrigo Muniz provided a wide array of game-changing possibilities to a manager with a proven track record of making impactful substitutions.",
      "Silva brought a couple of players on in both the 75th and 83rd minutes, including Bobb’s debut and Muniz’s long-awaited return from injury. Everton scored within seconds on both occasions, which was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "Definitely worth recalling a player featuring relatively regularly on loan at Porto B, just for him to play four minutes in three Premier League games and nine minutes in the FA Cup since January for Wolves.",
      "",
      "Ticked off an increasingly barren list of managers and clubs Mikel Arteta has never beaten.",
      "",
      "The resistance he offered to Rayan was hilariously risible so whoever Digne seemed to hold responsible for the Bournemouth equaliser must have had an absolute ‘mare.",
      "Emiliano Buendia and Douglas Luiz both seemed to think the culprit was stood precisely where Digne was so the plot thickens.",
      "This is the season of Premier League bosses being told they’re ‘getting sacked in the morning’. But Thomas Frank, Sean Dyche and friends should make it to lunch.",
      "At least Ruben Amorim never even vaguely teased he might string together five wins. Michael Carrick should be ashamed for taking Manchester United close",
      "We’re really starting to think that Ruben Amorim freezing out Kobbie Mainoo might not have been his smartest decision. But he’s far from alone.",
      "Eddie Howe’s future at Newcastle looks more doubtful than ever before but when would the club actually decide to sack him?",

Villa, notoriously ruthless and efficient at home, are on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet for maximum points. That looks generous based on what Brighton are serving up.",

Three fouls and a yellow card in his first appearance shows a striker visibly eager to impose himself and to make a statement.",
      "Strand Larsen averages around 1.9 fouls per game in the Premier League. That's potentially almost two yellow-card-worthy moments every 90 minutes. He carries the aura of a striker playing like it's only a matter of time before he oversteps, mistimes a challenge or lashes out in frustration.

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 21:42, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "Aston Villa vs Brighton - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Home losses to Everton and Brentford have curtailed momentum and there really will be panic on the Holte End if they succumb to defeat against Brighton. Manchester United and Chelsea are catching Villa. Liverpool are not far behind.",
      "The fear is that it is not only the teams below them who are catching up with Villa but the schedule too. Emery's side could yet play 60 games this season compared to United's 40 - and are without Youri Tielemans, John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara.",
      "None of that midfield trio are expected back until April and that presents a challenge for Emery to find solutions within the squad. With Leeds at home next up in the Premier League followed by Wolves away, any slip would be a major blow to their top-five hopes.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's concerns are even more immediate given the chants of, 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' during Brighton's home defeat to rivals Crystal Palace on Sunday. A result at Villa might be required.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace vs Burnley - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Some may argue that the pressure has been on all season for Scott Parker and Burnley - it's always a tough ask for promoted teams to be competitive in their first season back in the Premier League.",
      "But for a club that has often stuck with managers in difficult moments, the board's ears might begin to prickle after boos on Saturday as the Clarets lost 2-0 to relegation rivals West Ham - that is despite having 18 shots, their most in a Premier League game this season.",
      "It leaves them 11 points from safety and with no win in 16 league outings since beat bottom side Wolves on October 26. Until recently, they might have earmarked a trip to Crystal Palace as one where points could be gained.",
      "The Eagles were rarely out of the headlines in January amid a tumultuous period, but picking up their first Premier League win in nine games against rivals Brighton will give them a boost.",
      "It has taken the sting out of the tail at Selhurst Park when one wondered if a superb period of success was spectacularly unravelling before our eyes.",
      "That seems to have been halted for the time being and at home against teams near or below them, Crystal Palace have a good record.",
      "The form guide says it will be another tough Premier League match for Burnley, as Parker continues to look for ways to avoid the drop back into the Championship.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Man City vs Fulham - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Manchester City have been involved in some nonsensical games in recent weeks - the win at Liverpool and draw at Tottenham just two of them - and yet their position in the title race seems to make perfect sense.",
      "City might need something special to topple Arsenal but the prospect is yet to be rendered inconceivable. The statement at Anfield will have done as much to convince the City players themselves as it has to remind those of us who merely pass comment that the race is still open.",
      "Gary Neville believes Pep Guardiola, Erling Haaland and Gianluigi Donnarumma to be central to this rival plan. But that's too simplistic and overlooks the importance of Bernardo Silva, Rodri, as well as the returning Ruben Dias - the spine of strength. They all know how to win titles.",
      "Coupled with that is the immediate impact of January additions Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo; compelling reinforcements at this stage of the season. They both bring fresh ambition.",
      "Moving to within three points of the Gunners with victory over Fulham would ensure the scoreboard pressure mounts and Arsenal have proven to be unreliable leaders when chasers make their move to overtake in the past. City may have to leave it late again against Fulham, who have lost eight games this season after the 80th minute.",
      "It might just be enough to divert Arsenal's attention. If City wrestle enough initiative, they won't back down until they get what they want. Pep will make sure of that.Laura Hunter",
      "Nottingham Forest vs Wolves - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Every day of the weekend brought a fresh blow for Nottingham Forest. Their insipid defeat to Leeds on Friday gifted three points to a relegation rival, before West Ham won well on Saturday and Crystal Palace ended their poor run with a victory on Sunday.",
      "The upshot is that Forest risk being in the bottom three before they even take to the field against bottom club Wolves on Wednesday night and with former boss Nuno Espirito Santo having improved West Ham's fortunes, the scrutiny on Sean Dyche is increasing.",
      "Four of the last five Premier League wins for Forest have come away from home where the counter-punching style can be more effective. Dyche's style of play is yet to convince the supporters and expectation could create tension by the Trent in midweek.",
      "While Wolves' own relegation has long since felt inevitable, and they threw the game away early at home to Chelsea on Saturday, they have been in games more than one might expect of a team adrift at the bottom and that can unnerve fragile opponents.",
      "Forest's FA Cup exit means there's an 11-day break before their next fixture against Liverpool and the mood during that period will be shaped by the outcome of this game. Failing to beat Wolves would be unthinkable, and yet many fans are already dreading it.Adam Bate",
      "Sunderland vs Liverpool - 8.15pm, Wednesday",
      "Sunderland are unbeaten in all 12 of their Premier League games played at the Stadium of Light this season, a record that puts them fourth in the home form table, and is the longest run by a promoted side since 1977-78. No team wants to travel to that outpost in north-east England, least of all Liverpool, having only managed to win two of their last 10 on the road.",
      "This fixture has got the potential to make things infinitely harder for Arne Slot after a troubling weekend. Things could go from bad to worse with no right-back to speak of (after stand-in Dominik Szoboszlai was sent off in defeat to Manchester City) and a crisis of confidence that just won't shake. Liverpool have conceded 21 goals away from Anfield this term - more than bottom side Wolves (20).",
      "But the desperation to keep up with their rivals in the top-four race might just be enough for Liverpool to rediscover some spark. Slot's side still boast some of the best attacking numbers in the league, and the Reds boss will be equally aware of the position they will find themselves in if they don't win. The gap to the European spots is already four. It can ill-afford to get any larger.Laura Hunter",
      "Brentford vs Arsenal - 8pm, Thursday",
      "Arsenal seem to be running away with the Premier League title, while Brentford are up to seventh after their first win away at Newcastle since 1934. The Gunners are top of the form table over the last 10 matches (W7 D2 L1) and the Bees are just behind (W6 D2 L2).",
      "Brentford's home form remains - as it has done for several years - among the best in the division, but Arsenal's away form is the best, bar none. If those stats aren't enough to whet the appetite, this is a battle between two set-piece specialists.",
      "Brentford - led by their former set-piece coach Keith Andrews - piqued interest with their success from long throws, so much so that, in October, Erling Haaland said playing them \"reminded me a bit of Stoke City with [Rory] Delap\". Michael Kayode and Mathias Jensen are the men tasked with delivering the monstrous deliveries that have been the source of three goals so far - the joint-second most in the division.",
      "In all, they have scored 11 goals from set-pieces and conceded nine, making them one of only eight teams yet to enter double figures in that regard.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side, on the other hand, are in a league of their own. Twenty of their 49 league goals have come from set-pieces (40.8 per cent), with 14 of those scored from corners. Both totals are unmatched in the Premier League this season. They have also only conceded five of 17 so far in that manner, which is also the least in the Premier League.",
      "If this game is to be decided by fine margins, few fixtures are better equipped to deliver.Dan Long",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's impressive return to the Manchester United team shows what Ruben Amorim was missing. Also in The Debrief: More Bruno Fernandes numbers, Bernardo Silva's influential display, Enzo Fernandez's 'new' position and Angel Gomes' debut",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 20:59, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Monday 9 February 2026 15:10, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",
