They are now under new manager with Thomas Frank at the helm and seeking quality reinforcements for the upcoming season, where they will return to the Champions League.",

      "“It’s clear he doesn’t have the appetite to play for United anymore and it’s a shame, but that’s how it’s become. It doesn’t seem like anyone really wants to touch him now. He’s had his people working for him, trying to sell him and say how well he was playing for Villa when in my mind, he wasn’t.",

      "Given the fact he will be 39 next season, a move for Vardy will only happen towards the end of the window should they lose out on their priority targets. But it appears that legendary former manager Ferguson would be a big fan of a deal having hailed Vardy in the past.",
      "Speaking back in 2015 in the middle of Leicester’s title charge, he said: “He (Vardy) is aggressive, he is quick, he has got energy and he has got a goal in him. He has proved that.",
      "“He has got assets suited to modern-day football, particularly at a club like Leicester City. Our Darren (his son) wanted to sign him at Peterborough but Leicester came in. Vardy is a great example of never giving in and keeping a great belief in himself.”",
      "Vardy has gone on to score 145 Premier League goals in 342 appearances. And while a move to Old Trafford looks unlikely at this stage, another legendary former Red Devil is also a big fan.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy - who endured a disastrous spell in the Midlands before his sacking - regularly hailed Vardy and his abilities. Speaking in May, the Dutchman said: \"When you see the amount of times a player is performing at the highest level, for me that is the biggest achievement.",
      "\"When you're capable of performing in 13 seasons at this level, coming up to 500 games, coming up 200 goals, that says it all, on your mindset and standards you set yourself, how you live your life around football and how you perform.",

      "While nothing concrete has materialised in terms of a transfer so far this summer, it now seems all but certain Vlahovic will leave Turin in the coming weeks.",

      "And with an agreement unlikely, Juventus are now preparing to make Vlahovic an offer to rip up his contract 12 months early.",
      "While it remains to be seen if Vlahovic would consider such an offer if he is determined to bank the amount he's owed for the final year of his contract, becoming a free agent could appeal to the frontman.",
      "With a host of top European clubs in the market for a new striker this summer, Vlahovic's availability means he would likely be able to command higher wages and, potentially, a significant signing-on fee.",

The 25-year-old enjoyed the most productive season of his career last term as he hit 25 goals in all competitions for Fiorentina.

      "From one English striker to another now, Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins could potentially be available this season. And it appears that United have already been exploring a deal having held exploratory talks with Villa earlier this year.",
      "However, a move for the 29-year-old might not be so straightforward. Villa are expected to demand around £60m for his signature having also rebuffed interest from Arsenal in January.",
      "Newcastle have also discussed Watkins and might be a bigger draw given their spot in the Champions League next term.",
      "Another England international, ex-Leicester forward Vardy has arguably been one of the most consistent Premier League goalscorers over the past decade. He left the King Power last season having notched his 200th goal for the club across a glittering spell.",
      "And he would also be a bargain option given he would be available for nothing. But again, there are some concerns.",
      "Vardy will be 39 in January, which could see him drop down the pecking order. There’s also interest from America, Saudi Arabia and Wrexham so United might be keen to look at other options.",
      "Following a productive five-year spell with Newcastle, striker Callum Wilson confirmed his departure from St James’ Park earlier this summer. So he would be another available for nothing.",

      "Marcus Rashford reported back for pre-season training at Manchester United on Monday and Tuesday - despite being given extra time off to find a new club. Rashford, 27, was among five players who United told could return to Carrington at a later date if they were unable to secure a transfer.",
      "But the England international still arrived at the Red Devils' training centre. Rashford worked individually and wasn't part of any sessions with rest of Ruben Amorim's squad, the Athletic report.",
      "That group of players included new £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha, who the club announced in a social media post on Tuesday had taken the No.10 shirt from Rashford. United said on Friday that Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia would be allowed to return later in July amid their uncertain futures.",

      "Garnacho has been linked with moves to Chelsea and Napoli, Antony is wanted by Real Betis and it's been claimed in Italy that Sancho has agreed terms with Juventus. Malacia, meanwhile, is said to be struggling to attract buyers.",
      "Barcelona are the favourites to sign Rashford after missing out on top target Nico Williams, who's signed a new 10-year contract with Athletic Bilbao. Luis Diaz is an option, although Liverpool recently rebuffed an approach from Bayern Munich.",
      "It's been reported in Spain that Rashford would be willing to take a sizeable pay cut on his £325,000-a-week salary in order to join Barca, who'd prefer a loan deal given that United are demanding £40m. The Red Devils want to raise funds before making any further signings beyond Cunha and Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, as talks between the clubs over a potential £63m deal continue.",
      "Amorim wants to refresh his attack which is why Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are on the chopping block. Should they manage to offload their unwanted stars, United plan to dip into the striker market, having missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea earlier in the window and Viktor Gyokeres - who worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon - set to sign for Arsenal."

      "Martinez, who has endured a series of injury setbacks since joining United in 2022, admitted that his mental health took a hit during his time in the Netherlands. \"I've been in therapy since I was at Ajax,\" he told Clank Media.",
      "\"I was always against it until I found myself at a point in my life in Amsterdam where I had everything... I played for a European team, I was in the national team, I had the car I always wanted, I played every weekend, and I still felt empty, like I wasn't happy.",

      "Therapy, he explained, helped him shift his perspective. \"Since I started, I haven't stopped,\" Martinez continued. \"I understood that you shouldn't look for anything outside but rather inside. I found happiness and peace with myself, which is priceless.\"",
      "His reflections on his upbringing in Gualeguay, Argentina, paint a picture of resilience forged in adversity. \"I come from a very poor background,\" he shared. \"I know what it is to struggle, to be hungry, cold, hot. Did I go hungry? Yes.",

But Martinez, who was sidelined again with an ACL injury in February, says he has a good relationship with new head coach Amorim, who has brought \"energy and willingness\" to the squad.",
      "\"The club is obviously going through a process of change,\" he said. \"Since Six Alex Ferguson's departure, they haven't found a manager who hits the right note. Ten Hag did a remarkable job at Ajax, which is why he went to United, and thanks to him, I joined the club as well.",
      "\"It's like everything in life: you take a gamble, and sometimes it works out well, sometimes it doesn't. I think that, like any club, if something isn't working, it needs to be changed. It's necessary to analyse what's working and what isn't and make changes accordingly because that's how great clubs operate. Manchester is one of the best clubs in the world.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is growing increasingly frustrated by Manchester United's failure to agree a deal with Brentford. The forward has made it clear that he wants to join United this summer, having rejected the chance to follow former Bees boss Thomas Frank to Tottenham.",
      "Brentford want more than the £62.5million United paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha and have rejected two bids so far. United are now weighing up a third offer for Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals in 38 Premier League games last season.",
      "And, as first reported by the Standard, both Mbeumo and Brentford have become frustrated with the slow progress. Brentford are happy with their stance, feeling it has been backed up by the prices both being asked, and paid by clubs, for players in similar positions, notably Noni Madueke and Anthony Elanga.",
      "Arsenal are interested in signing Madueke, with Chelsea valuing the England international at more than £50m, while Newcastle have agreed a deal worth £55m to sign Elanga from Nottingham Forest.",
      "Brentford believe the fee they are demanding for Mbeumo, when compared to the aforementioned trio, is more than fair.",
      "Director of football Phil Giles recently spoke out about Mbeumo's future and suggested he could end up staying at Brentford. \"He had a fantastic season,\" Giles told BBC Sport said last month.",
      "\"We expected big interest in him, we have had big interest in him. He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career, of course he does – he is well within his rights to do that. We are in constant dialogue with him and representatives about that.",
      "\"As it stands at the minute we don't have an agreement in place for him to leave. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay. It has to be the right deal for Brentford, any club will tell you that.",
      "\"If it's not right deal why would we do it? He is certainly one of our best players, if not our best player, and we need our best players. There's no harm in keeping your best players.\"",
      "However, Brentford have agreed a deal to sell club captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal for around £10m.",
      "\"We have been in conversations with Arsenal for the last week to 10 days,\" Giles confirmed. \"As it stands it hasn't been completed yet but it is heading in that direction. If that happens for him then fantastic, he's earned it.",
      "\"He's been a brilliant captain for us. Let's see how that story ends but we are pretty open about that interest there.\"",

      "But until those two things happen, United's transfer window remains in stasis.",
      "United's major priority this summer was to solve last season's goalscoring woes. The arrivals of Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, will certainly help that but they need a proven goalscorer up front given Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed just seven league goals between them last term.",

      "Osimhen is out of favour at parent club Napoli but scored 37 goals in all competitions as Gala won a league and cup double in Turkey.",
      "The Turkish giants are preparing to activate his £65million release clause and are in talks with Napoli over paying it in instalments. It means the two most eye-catching names linked with United are now set to move elsewhere.",
      "The likes of Hugo Ekitike, Ollie Watkins and Moise Kean have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, too, but the fear is that the longer United wait for movement on deals elsewhere, the more narrow their search for a top striker will become down the line."

      "With Manchester United's players back in the building at Carrington, the countdown to the start of the 2025/26 Premier League campaign is officially on.",
      "United will kick off the new season against Arsenal at Old Trafford in a little over five weeks time, meaning the clock is ticking amid head coach Ruben Amorim's quest to overhaul his squad this summer.",
      "The United chief has already been able to land one of his top targets, securing Matheus Cunha's services from Wolves for £62.5million last month, but progress on other fronts has since slowed.",
      "United looked set to build on the signing of Cunha by also getting a deal over the line nice and early for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. This publication reported a fortnight ago that a deal was close to being finalised after United had submitted a second offer in excess of £60m.",
      "However, the Bees moved the goalposts and United are yet to lodge a third bid for the Cameroonian, who plundered a very impressive 20 Premier League goals last season.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, has made it clear to Brentford that he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer, meaning both United and the player are equally keen to get a deal wrapped up as soon as possible. However, some supporters are beginning to get itchy feet at the length of time it is taking and are fearing United are getting dragged into a never-ending saga.",
      "Originally, United set a target of signing Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season training. Fifteen players reported back to Carrington on Monday and Diego Leon and Cunha were the only new additions to be introduced to their new teammates.",
      "Despite United's desperate need for fresh blood this summer, they are not thought to be close to completing any other signings at this stage. Player sales remain key to their hopes of strengthening Amorim's squad and the club is yet to oversee a permanent departure in this window.",
      "Amorim's troops will step up their pre-season preparations at the end of next week when they travel to Stockholm to face Premier League counterparts Leeds United in their opening friendly. They will then travel to the United States a few days later for their pre-season tour.",
      "With a fortnight to go until United are scheduled to fly to the US, they are approaching a key period in the transfer window. Amorim, just like every other head coach and manager, will have the ambition of having the bulk of his transfer business done ahead of the start of the season, ensuring new signings get as long as possible to get to know their new teammates and what is expected of them ahead of the competitive action starting in August.",
      "United made their opening offer for Mbeumo, which was worth £55m, more than a month ago, meaning everyone anticipated a deal would be wrapped up by now. Instead, the saga is still rumbling on and a second bid north of £60m has not been enough.",
      "United are prioritising strengthening their attack this summer and put down an early marker by signing Cunha. Having then set a target of signing Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season, United made it crystal clear that they wanted to move at speed.",
      "Having missed that particular deadline, United must now attempt to get the former Troyes man through the door ahead of flying across the Atlantic in a fortnight's time. Their opening game of the Premier League Summer Series is against West Ham United on July 27.",
      "It would be ideal if United could get Mbeumo through the door by then as they are unlikely to have landed an out-and-out centre-forward, which is another leading priority this summer, by the time they face the Hammers in New Jersey.",
      "The prospect of having Cunha and Mbeumo in attack in time for the tour would supplement the absence of a new chief striker. They scored 37 goals between them last season and will be able to ease the burden on whoever ends up being Amorim's starting No.9.",
      "But with the clock ticking and the start of the tour now just over a fortnight away, United are in a race against time to bring this saga to an end and make Mbeumo their latest summer signing."

      "Manchester United could reportedly be on the verge of missing out on Bryan Mbeumo this summer after Tottenham Hotspur opened interest in his Brentford teammate Yoane Wissa.",
      "Wissa and Mbeumo have been a formidable partnership for the Bees and with 19 and 20 goals scored respectively between them in the Premier League. The Cameroonian has drawn interest from United and they have been locked in negotiations with Brentford for his signature since last month.",
      "MEN Sport understands that two offers have been rejected so far for Mbeumo but there is still confidence from United that they will be able to get a deal done. However, a spanner appears to have been thrown into the works on Wednesday.",
      "Multiple reports, including from BBC Sport, claim that Thomas Frank has instructed Spurs to target Wissa this transfer window. Tottenham are currently understood to be weighing up the financials surrounding the deal.",
      "Frank had wanted to bring Mbeumo with him to north London, but was informed the 25-year-old would be leaving for Old Trafford or not at all in the summer. This has led Tottenham to reassess their options and Wissa is thought to be keen on a move to Spurs.",
      "Unfortunately for United, journalist Ben Jacobs understands that Brentford are only willing to let Wissa or Mbeumo leave, not both. This means that should Wissa agree terms with Spurs, the move for Mbeumo could be scuppered completely.",
      "The good news for United is that they are clearly in a more advanced stage in their negotiations to sign Mbeumo so have the upper hand there. But, it has been claimed that Mbeumo is happy to stay at Brentford so the Reds cannot rely on the forward forcing a move from the club should the Bees decide not to sell.",
      "It seems United are now in a position where they must come to a quick agreement with Brentford for Mbeumo or risk missing out."

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford has shown his current manager Ruben Amorim that he is putting in the hard work ahead of the new season.",
      "Rashford's future is currently uncertain after a quiet summer for the 27-year-old to date. Following his loan stint at Aston Villa, it appeared that a move to Barcelona was his priority however the Catalan club chose to focus their efforts on Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.",
      "In a surprising twist, Williams decided to snub Barca and sign a new ten-year contract with Athletic Bilbao. This left the La Liga giants needing to change their focus, potentially back to Rashford.",
      "In the meantime, MEN Sport understands Rashford was one of five players to be given an extended summer break to allow him to pursue opportunities elsewhere. Despite this, The Athletic understands Rashford attended Carrington on Monday and Tuesday to undertake individual training away from the senior squad who returned on Monday too.",
      "United pushed ahead with the expectation that Rashford is leaving the club this summer by confirming that Matheus Cunha would be the club's new No.10 this season. A move which perhaps indicates that they do not expect the winger to be at the club much longer.",
      "With it no clearer as to where Rashford will be playing football next season, the forward sent a three word message to his fans via Instagram as he showed off his gym work. Posting a series of pictures and clips from The Performance Space in Manchester, Rashford captured the post: \"No days off.\"",
      "This could easily be interpreted as a message to Amorim considering that the Portuguese head coach claimed he was disappointed with Rashford's attitude on the training ground prior to his move to Aston Villa. Amorim even insisted that he would rather put his goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital on the bench before a player that was not giving his all in training.",
      "Speaking back in January about Rashfford's absence from the squad, Amorim said: \"It's always the same reason: the training, the way I see a footballer should do in life. It's every day, every detail.",
      "\"If things don't change, I will not change. It's the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player.",
      "\"You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench. But I would put [Man Utd goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\"",

Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are amongst those up for sale this summer, but they will be difficult to move on and there is little noise about their next destination yet.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is the next, most advanced target for United, but the club are yet to submit their third bid to Brentford for the high-flying forward. The London club are holding out for more than £60 million, despite Mbeumo wanting to go, and United face the pre-season milestone of flying to the US for the Premier League Summer Series soon.",
      "The languid pace of such an important summer transfer window has left some fans feeling the world is passing United by. Reader Davejwigan says of Mbeumo: \"Think it’s time we ditched this signing. He keeps saying he wants United and United want him, BUT it's the same old rubbish, the selling club demands more because it’s United. This has gone on long enough, give Brentford an ultimatum, sell now or lose the sale... he [is] not all that good anyway.\"",
      "Bkl writes: \"NOT too impressed with the buying, or lack of buying. And the sales? Typical Utd to buy at 70m, and being forced to sell flops at 25 m. We clearly need a keeper, and 1 or 2 strikers.\"",
      "Commenter Babiss says: \"When will the Glazers, Ratcliffe and Ineos, as well as the board be questioned on the running of the club? We need top class players in before the US tour. At present we've got through 6 strikers and we are still not over the line. Then there's the question of a goalkeeper, it's no good us getting a striker that will score lots of goals whilst at the other end Onana is letting in the same amount.\"",
      "Fanaticmanufan writes: \"This is trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Let Brentford keep him. They are horse trading for £2.5 million or so. Nothing in the bigger scheme of things. Don’t get bullied by Brentford.\"",
      "Gemini2806 says: \"Ineos should be actively pursuing multiple deals, in particular a striker, instead of being obsessed with just Mbeumo. It has now been 5 weeks long, this saga. Pay up or walk away and if they are short of cash, use the money to buy a striker.\"",
      "Bestietom writes: \"Has the 3rd bid even gone in yet? There is barely a mention of us putting in that 3rd and supposedly, final bid for Mbeumo. What is holding this up, as we have the money to get this deal over the line? Have we changed our mind and are looking at another deal, or are we still trying to compromise with Brentford before we make [a] final offer? All should be known by the end of this week, we hope.\"",
      "Garth123 reckons the Mbeumo deal will happen eventually: \"In my honest opinion, United have reached the point of no return with this deal, otherwise they will lose face and have wasted over 6 weeks of negotiations. So it's really not a deal they can simply walk away from like some fans have suggested.\"",

      "Osimhen has been another striker heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford. The 26-year-old scored 37 goals in 41 games in Turkey last season to help Galatasaray win a league and cup double.",
      "He has since returned to Napoli upon the expiry of his loan spell at Gala but the Italian champions are anticipated to cash-in this summer. However, United's chances of being the team to sign him are decreasing.",
      "Galatasaray are understood to be pushing to sign him permanently and have sent a second proposal to Napoli. CalcioMercato have reported that their first bid in the region of €60m (£51.6m) was turned down by Napoli and a second offer has now been put on the table.",
      "The new bid is worth €75m (£64.6m), the amount that matches Osimhen's release clause at the Azzurri. However, it's said that Galatasaray won't trigger the release clause in favour of paying the fee across five instalments.",
      "It's yet to be seen whether Napoli accept the financial package or demand the payment in full. United may struggle to afford Osimhen's release clause after already spending £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, knowing that a further £65m could be splashed on Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on joining the club."

A whole host of rumours have already been circling which have claimed to provide updates on the players that are of interest to United.",

      "Reports have speculated that Carreras could be set to join Madrid for €50million (£43million), the value of the left-back's release clause at Benfica. If this was to be the case, United could be entitled to as much as £4.3million with a 10 per cent sell-on clause or £8.6million with 20 per cent.",
      "If United are merely entitled to a percentage of any profit, that would see the figures decrease marginally. A 10 per cent sell-on clause would see United given £3.8million - and a 20 per cent clause would result in a £7.6million bonus for United.",
      "If Carreras does go on to join Madrid and United receive a sell-on clause value, it could be part of a double transfer windfall for the club. Ex-United winger Anthony Elanga is reportedly close to joining Newcastle in a £55million deal.",
      "United sold Elanga to Forest last summer for £15million - but did include a 20 per cent sell-on clause for any future profit. That means United could receive as much as £8million if Elanga does go on to complete a move to St James' Park.",
      "Combined, it's possible that United may receive as much as £16.6million from two deals that don't involve any of their own players. These funds could go a long way to helping the club complete their own transfer business this summer."

For Amorim, the 2025/26 season will be one where he has to return the club back to basics to try and address the alarming decline, and for the sake of £15m or £20m, money that could be accrued through player trading, of which United have many saleable assets they can book a profit on, the potential intrusion and impact that may have caused to a squad where plenty have already shown the weight of history and expectation to hang heavy, wasn’t deemed worth the risk.",
      "This was likely a pretty easy no to take for United and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, particularly if it was felt that it would hamper the club’s chances of returning themselves to European football’s elite Champions League group by the end of this season, a feat that would yield far greater financial gains that a documentary would.",
      "But storytelling is only going to become more prevalent, and clubs are going to find more ways to try and find a narrative that has broad appeal, especially as the game continues to become more global and when traditional domestic broadcasting rights are being squeezed.",
      "United know they have reach, that has never been a problem, the issue that they have had for some time is a negative perception of the football club, and that isn’t great for fans, current or future, or commercial partners. The lack of competitive success has come at a time of a succession of PR disasters, such as mass redundancies of non-playing staff in a bid to cut costs.",
      "They will need to present a better image in the coming seasons and it should be no surprise if a documentary forms part of that. But for this coming season, the overriding need for the club to get its house in order behind closed doors and have that reflected through improved performances on the pitch is paramount."

      "Most Manchester United supporters would have loved to have been a fly on the dressing room wall at various junctures last season.",
      "Experiencing their worst season in 51 years, United slumped to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League, meaning they will not participate in any European competition for the first time in a decade in 2025/26.",
      "Despite making the decision to sack Erik ten Hag in October and replace him with Ruben Amorim just a few days later, United never recovered from a summer that saw the hierarchy dawdle and fail to address their most pressing needs in the transfer market.",
      "The season featured a catalogue of woes that every United supporter will wish to forget as quickly as possible. The hope and expectation is that next season will be much better.",
      "And if Amazon had had their way, they would have had every angle covered. Just as they had done with Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur in previous years, they wanted to produce an access-all-areas documentary to offer an insight into what goes on behind the scenes at one of the world's biggest sporting institutions.",
      "However, according to a report published by The Athletic on Monday, secret talks between United and Amazon have been shelved after head coach Amorim expressed fears that it could distract his players.",
      "It has been reported that Amazon's offer 'was significantly more than £10million', meaning United would have banked the largest ever payment for an 'All or Nothing' series.",
      "It is claimed Amorim, who has just embarked on his first pre-season as United head coach, was 'not comfortable with potential intrusion on the first-team'. The documentary would have followed every aspect of the Reds' 2025/26 campaign, meaning team meetings, dressing room exchanges and much, much more would have been under the spotlight.",
      "Every football supporter, regardless of who they support, is guilty and wanting to know about every nook and cranny that goes on inside the corridors of their club, meaning a United documentary would have been insightful. On the flip side, however, it would have opened the door for further ridicule if United were to struggle again next season.",
      "Having failed to qualify for next season's Champions League, United have missed out on several important revenue streams. A successful Champions League campaign can be worth more than £100m, factoring in prize money, gate receipts, sponsorship deals and various other means.",
      "As a result of losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, United's transfer budget this summer is not as big as what it would have otherwise been, meaning they are having to box clever in this summer's window. Progress has been slow thus far, reflected in the Reds' tally of just two new arrivals, and player sales are key to funding new additions.",
      "With that in mind, the chance to bank more than £10m would have had United's decision makers licking their lips. Every cash injection, however big or small, will be welcomed with open arms this summer.",
      "However, United find themselves walking a fine line between the financial side and the sporting side of the operation. The club's hierarchy knows Amorim has got to oversee a serious improvement next season and it is evident the Portuguese chief believes his players will have a better chance of helping the club climb the table without a TV crew following their every move.",
      "To have adhered to Amorim's request shows that United's decision makers are in full support of the former Sporting Lisbon boss. They have put plenty of trust in him and this decision only strengthens their case to show they are backing him in every possible way.",
      "Ensuring everyone is on the same page is a strong recipe for success, and it is vital for any head coach to have the backing of those above him in the chain of command.",
      "The fact United's top brass have backed out of a deal that would have brought in much-needed funds, to ensure Amorim is more comfortable with hopefully overseeing a season of progress, can only be considered as a positive on the sporting side of the operation.",
      "Amorim clearly felt the timing was all wrong for a documentary to be manufactured and his concerns have been noted."

      "Physical testing is a key part at the start of any club's pre-season training regime, meaning it was no surprise to see United's players working on their strength. They were tasked with completing a set of pull-ups. Among those involved was Joshua Zirkzee, who experienced problems with a hamstring injury towards the end of last season. Despite being passed fit to feature in the Europa League final, he missed the Premier League finale against Aston Villa and then the post-season tour. Seeing him back on the first day of pre-season is a positive sign.",
      "After offering signs of his capabilities last season, Harry Amass will be keen to maintain his upward trajectory in 2025/26. He was among the returnees at Carrington on Monday and was spotted working on his strength, being tasked with some weightlifting.",

      "",
      "19) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",

      "18) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nSancho is refusing to leave any of the final year of his United salary on the table, which is making things awkward for everyone. And now we learn that the ex-England winger is currently an alternative option for Juve while they prioritise Francisco Conceicao, who was on loan in Turin from Porto. The Old Lady has a week to snare Conceicao for a discounted fee of £25million, but even that amount requires some negotiation.",

Diaz’s willingness to move appears greater than Liverpool’s intent to sell, so the Colombian may have to force the issue if he’s really so keen to try something new.",

Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca’s hopes of signing Luis Diaz appear dashed, which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",

Chelsea need to sell, as they seemingly always do, to meet UEFA guidelines and they are expecting an offer from Arsenal. They have received a call, in which the Blues told their London rivals they expect in excess of £50million. Worth it?",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",
      "",
      "6) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "5) Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nNewcastle have accepted Leeds’ latest offer, worth £10million and another £2million in add-ons, which handy since it was their best and final bid. It is now up to Longstaff if he fancies swapping Uniteds. Remember when Mike Ashley was quoting £50million for the midfielder?",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we’ve almost given up trying to keep up. The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw.",

      "However, United have a limited business and need to offload several high-paid talents to raise funds, with a recent report confirming Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are on the exit ramp.",
      "Sancho recently returned to Man Utd as he spent the 2024/25 campaign on loan at Premier League rivals Chelsea.",
      "His career at United has been all but over since his huge fallout with former boss Erik ten Hag in September 2o23 and current head coach Ruben Amorim appears unwilling to give him another chance.",
      "READ: Rashford handed brutal ‘fresh humiliation’ as Gyokeres ‘fears the worst’ amidst Ange ‘shock’",
      "The England international had a mixed spell at Stamford Bridge as he scored in the Europa Conference League final, but Chelsea’s hierarchy felt he did not do enough to earn a permanent move.",
      "Sancho’s loan move included an obligation to buy clause worth around £25m, but they could pay a reported penalty fee of £5m to pull out of the deal, and they took Man Utd up on this option.",
      "The winger has been linked with several Premier League and European clubs in recent weeks, with Serie A giants Juventus mooted as a possible destination.",
      "Juventus were Chelsea’s main competitors in the race to sign Sancho during the 2024 summer window and they remain interested in the Man Utd outcast.",
      "Now, a report in Italy claims ‘everyone is waiting’ to close Sancho’s proposed move to Juventus, with all parties ‘almost at a virtual handshake’ over a transfer.",
      "The report does not mention the structure of the deal, but it is noted that the player is keen on the move and would accept a wage reduction to boost Juventus’ chances.",
      "And journalist Rudy Galetti for our pals at TEAMtalk says Sancho to Juventus has ‘thundered closer’ as the winger has ‘taken drastic action’. This is said to come as he’s ‘open to a wage reduction’, with a deal said to be likely for around £21.5m.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The 25-year-old, who spent last season on loan with Chelsea, has shown strong interest in joining Juventus and is now open to a wage reduction – a key step that has helped advance negotiations.",
      "‘TEAMtalk can confirm that the Turin-based club are now in discussions with Sancho over a four-year contract worth €7m (£6m / $8.2m) per year, which equates to around £115,000 per week. Sancho’s current reported wage with Man Utd is £250,000, so this would mark a 54 percent wage cut if he signs with Juventus.’",
      "Man Utd will welcome any suitor for their band of misfits and here are eight possible reunions which could aid what currently looks like a woefully inadequate summer rebuild.",
      "Former Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to bring Jadon Sancho to Besiktas this summer and has made enquiries, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘agreed’ to sell Jadon Sancho to Juventus, but wage demands and transfer terms are proving tricky.",
      "According to reports, the ‘latest development’ at Manchester United has angered four ‘unhappy’ players as INEOS look to cash in on several unwanted talents.",
      "According to reports, five Manchester United stars have ‘informed’ the Premier League giants that they ‘wish to leave’ during this summer’s transfer window.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘offered’ at least two Juventus players ‘in exchange’ for Jadon Sancho."

      "An access-all-areas documentary was canned long before the cameras started rolling at Carrington, but the fact the idea ever reached Ruben Amorim illustrates how the Manchester United tragicomedy still has a few seasons left to run.",
      "The Athletic reported this week that the Red Devils had been in ‘secret talks’ with Amazon over an ‘All Or Nothing’ series to document next season.",
      "Who the f*** at Old Trafford received that initial proposal and thought it worthy of further consideration?",
      "Yes, we know United are having to tighten their belts and they have made their need to maximise every available revenue stream abundantly clear. Opening their doors to Amazon would have seen them bank in excess of £10million – the largest payment made to any club as a subject of ‘All Or Nothing’.",
      "That amounts to Matthijs De Ligt’s salary for a year, but it would not cover Mason Mount. So while £10million sounds like a lot of money to walk away from, even the secretary or PA who fielded the first enquiry should have recognised that it is a paltry sum to sell what remains of the club’s dignity.",
      "Because given the current state of Manchester United, as likely as not, it could be the biggest sh*tshow Amazon have produced. And they made Beast Games.",
      "You could certainly understand the appeal to Amazon. Barring a sudden and currently unexpected shift in how the team performs and the club conducts itself, Bezos could have Liverpool, City, Leeds fans paying off his wedding with the rush to subscribe among rivals’ supporters. Who of a non-United persuasion would not have paid £8.99 to be a retrospective fly-on-the-wall in recent seasons?",
      "To United fans, though, the most concerning aspect of The Athletic’s story was that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS crew were on board with the idea, as was chief executive Omar Berrada. We can understand the bean-counters’ enthusiasm when it was pitched to them, but Berrada has been credited with more nous in the past.",
      "What face did they expect to show of what is now football’s pre-eminent Banter Club? Have they really been paying so little attention over the last 18 months?",
      "If they have, they must recognise that all that is broken at Old Trafford cannot be fixed in one summer. Certainly not to the point where you would be happy to have everything out on display.",
      "🔴⚪⚫MORE MAN UTD COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Possible Alejandro Garnacho exit route closed as deal agreed for PSV star\n👉 Man Utd slash asking price for Andre Onana just two years after paying huge transfer fee",
      "But this is an organisation full of rake-treaders who presumed they could quite easily bank £150million-plus by selling four players who everyone knows they don’t want and can’t keep. Ratcliffe doesn’t come across as a rampant optimist, so perhaps he and his minions really are just naïve and incompetent.",
      "The positive for Amorim is that at least his protest was heard and acted upon. Though the fact he was ever troubled with the proposal must trigger more alarms in the manager’s mind. At least they might drown out the internal screams of a man who often struggles to hide his befuddlement and annoyance at what’s going on around him. The perma-presence of a production crew might have tipped him over the edge.",
      "More worryingly for the manager, the Amazon idea not being given the shortest of shrifts suggests that those above him expect this to be a season in which United show themselves in a positive light. But Amorim has already been denied the one thing that was expected to help him: a full pre-season with a squad he wants to work with.",
      "On Monday, he welcomed one new signing to Carrington among a group he largely tolerates, while giving four players he can suffer no longer a few more weeks off in the vain hope they might find themselves a new club.",
      "Still, at least when he is forced to open the door for most or all of his bomb squad, he won’t have to share the indignity with over 200 million Amazon Primers.",
      "Why are giving Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim excuses to be terrible? Plus, more on Spurs, Arsenal and Diogo Jota.",
      "Ruben Amorim has trumped Omar Berrada as Man Utd have ‘pulled the plug’ on a ‘record-breaking’ deal which would have been an absolute joy to behold.",
      "The only reason to persist with Ruben Amorim after his first few months was to give him a proper pre-season. But Manchester United have failed to deliver.",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",

      "Manchester United have transfer listed three Erik ten Hag signings, including Rasmus Hojlund, who is reportedly available for around £34.5million.",
      "The Red Devils signed Hojlund from Atalanta for an initial £64million in 2023, but he’s come nowhere near justifying the transfer fee.",
      "He didn’t score in the Premier League until his 15th appearance, finally netting against Aston Villa on Boxing Day before going on a brief run of seven goals and two assists in seven top-flight matches.",
      "Hojlund was poor overall last season, scoring just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances as United finished a dismal 15th.",
      "That form has led co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to consider selling the 22-year-old this summer, with interest from Italy — where he scored 10 goals in 34 games for Atalanta in 2022/23.",
      "One of the clubs keen on Hojlund is Inter Milan, who are reportedly looking to bring in the Danish striker on loan. United, however, are said to prefer a permanent deal if he is to leave.",
      "According to Interlive.it, Hojlund is already on the transfer list at Old Trafford, even though he ‘wants to stay’.",
      "Somewhat oddly, the report states that Hojlund would prefer to stay at the club ‘unless the Red Devils decide to put him on the market’ — but claims they already have.",
      "Also available for transfer this summer are Joshua Zirkzee and Andre Onana — both, like Hojlund, signed by former manager Ten Hag, who was sacked last October.",
      "As current boss Ruben Amorim looks to rebuild the squad, the report suggests Hojlund is one of the players he could ‘do away with to make money and put into practice yet another revolution’.",
      "Inter’s preference is a loan deal, potentially with a conditional obligation to buy, and the report adds that they haven’t ‘interrupted contact’ with the intermediary working on the deal.",
      "According to what has been collected by Interlive.it, in fact, it has been a while since the Nerazzurri have interrupted contact with the intermediary who was following the operation.",
      "Inter were working on a loan deal with the right or conditional obligation to buy. In this sense, however, an opening from Manchester had not yet arrived.",
      "The INEOS company is aiming for a permanent sale, see the negotiation for Sancho with Juve, precisely because it wants to get rid of those who are not part of the plans immediately.",
      "For Hojlund he asks for something like 45/50 million euros (£38.8-43.1m). After all, he spent almost twice as much to snatch him from Atalanta in August 2023.",
      "Because Inter have abandoned (at least for now. If Thuram left…) the Hojlund track? Because, as is well known, he decided to keep Pio Esposito who at the Club World Cup – for the little he played – proved to be a footballer already up to the situation.",
      "It could cost Man Utd £100m to sign Ollie Watkins this summer as Roma enter the race to sign Rasmus Hojlund, according to reports.",
      "Romano has revealed a Man Utd flop ‘doesn’t want to leave’ the club as a ‘major red flag’ has ruled out a move for his possible replacement.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘turn to’ a new striker target, but this potential deal hinges on one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "Man Utd will look to sell Joshua Zirkzee this summer if their attempts to offload Rasmus Hojlund continue to remain stale, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘politely declined’ the chance to sign a striker who scored just three goals last season, as his club attempted to secure a swap deal for Rasmus ...",
      "Ruben Amorim has chosen between Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee if Man Utd must sell one. He is also targeting a midfielder, according to reports."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave the ‘Here we go’ for Napoli’s move for Lang, with an agreement reached and only a medical needed before it can become official. The deal will cost Napoli €28million (£24million), far less than what United are asking for.",
      "Garnacho then appears no closer to leaving the Red Devils despite being one of five players to tell the club he wants out.",

      "However, Ruben Amorim’s have reportedly set a price tag of £60m for the player who has a deal until 2028.",
      "After coming off the bench in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, the winger was left out of the squad for United’s final Premier League game of last season and was told by head coach Amorim that he had to find a new club this summer.",

      "“The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.”",
      "Garnacho then burnt all remaining bridges by posting a picture of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford’s name on the back, another player looking to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Rashford at least seems to have more interest with rumours of a move to Barcelona seemingly unable to go away. The Spanish club’s failure to land Nico Williams has reopened the door to Rashford who has been linked with a move since January.",
      "Rashford reportedly sees a move to Barcelona as his ‘dream destination’ and is eager to get the deal done.",
      "If that fails to materialise, Newcastle are said to be interested in the England international but have been more closely linked with free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin after the 28-year-old left Everton.",

      "Manchester United have ‘asked intermediaries’ whether they can seal a £45m deal with Chelsea this summer as they ‘monitor the Blues’ outgoings’.",

Just put a cone there if you don’t want to waste time with your actual striker making runs that no one passes to. Who knows, maybe Bruno will be able to see it. If so, maybe whoever gets the now poisoned chalice of the 9 shirt should wear it in matches.",

He has got 14, 19 and 17 in his last 3 seasons. He scores crucial goals and is technically elite. He can actually dribble too, unlike Martinelli sadly. Martinelli cannot cut inside and shoot. He’s just not capable.",

      "",
      "Defending Arsenal on Partey\nI want to address the rancid steaming pile of droppings that is Stewie’s latest email. There’s no point addressing the football/transfer window content – it’s just too easy to point out he’s talking ass.",
      "However, I do want to address the question of Partey, suspension, and whether Arsenal has done anything wrong by continuing to play him. In short, Arsenal have not, and once again Stupid Griffen couldn’t be more wrong.",
      "The longer version of this explanation is that a suspension is needed when protection of the integrity of the investigation is required (most likely not in this case as I have not seen anything to suggest the alleged offences were in or related to the workplace). Further, and this is the key part, an employer such as Arsenal is obliged to avoid making public statements and taking any actions that might be interpreted as implying guilt and therefore prejudicing the defendant at trial.",
      "This extends to making public statements in the media or on social media, a point which was made by the CPS last week, when announcing charges against Partey:",
      "“We remind everyone that criminal proceedings are active, and the defendant has the right to a fair trial. We know there will be significant public interest in this announcement, but it is absolutely vital that there is no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”",
      "If Stupid Griffen ever bothered to listen or read, rather than just spout guff, he might have seen this or examined the rules. Assuming everyone wants Partey to receive a fair trial then suspending him is not the right approach.",
      "IF Partey is guilty, and you therefore want him convicted (rightly so, IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE), then no one wants his case to be thrown out on the basis that he didn’t receive a fair trial due to public opinion having been swayed by Arsenal’s actions or media stories that might be said to have influenced the verdict.",
      "Moreover, Arsenal is a company recently valued at GBP 2.1 Billion by Forbes. Does Stupid Griffen imagine that Arteta and a couple of the coaching staff went to the pub and decided what to do with Partey when they discovered the investigation was taking place?! Of course not, you lump of lead. Arsenal has an extensive team of HR and in-house lawyers who would have tackled the issue. No doubt they also would have received extensive external legal advice from top law firms and/or criminal barristers.",
      "Given that this situation has been running for a few years, I suspect Arsenal’s legal bill over this issue would make most people’s toes curl. I imagine Arsenal would have been at pains to make sure they were complying with every bit of advice given to them every inch of the way.",
      "Finally, if the above summary of the law and some facts aren’t enough for Mr. Stupid, then I’ll add my own ‘moral’ take. Everyone has the right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty and to receive fair trial. A world in which people are banned from their jobs/society because an accusation is made against them is not one I want to be a part of. It’s one step away from Nazi/Soviet totalitarianism where people ‘vanished’ because their neighbour reported on them for… something.",
      "The only Kangaroo Court I want to be a part of is an F365 vote on whether the rest of us want any more Stupid Griffen emails to ever be published again. I think you can all tell which way I’m leaning.\nJosh, AFC, Dubai",
      "",
      "…I felt compelled today after reading two negative opinions on Arsenal about the Thomas Partey situation. I feel there is a lot of ignorance being spewed as knowledge by many who",
      "1) Do not know about investigations\n2) Do not know what the club knows\n3) Despite saying otherwise have concluded someone is guilty just because he is charged",
      "I work in law enforcement investigating complex fraud and I know how long investigations take. We investigate for on average 3 to 4 years before gathering enough evidence to determine if a charge can be brought against an individual. During that process the individual has the right to keep on working and living his life.",
      "If we deem the person a flight risk, ie he may leave the Country for a jurisdiction we may not be able to get him back from, then we decide whether to take his passport away and keep him in this Country before a charge is or is not brought against him. After charge the case goes to Court and a jury decides his fate.",
      "Now in this case it was well known Partey was under investigation. This takes years and he is able to work and live his life during this period as long as he is not deemed a violent risk to others during the period of the investigation (an example of someone who may be deemed a risk is someone who works with children being investigated for molesting a child. That person will and should be immediately suspended).",
      "In Partey’s case, Arsenal would have assessed that he is not a risk of further offending after the opening of the investigation and may have been in dialogue with the Police about the investigation. Normally when we investigate we do not divulge any details of the investigation. It is likely the Police did not let on as to what will happen in their investigations to Arsenal. The club would have thus been in the dark. All they know is that Partey denies the allegations and as there were no charges against him the club had no reason to suspend him!!",
      "If the club has to suspend every player just because an investigation is started against a player they will be setting a very dangerous precedent. What about Mason Greenwood some might say. Well that was different because their was a piece of evidence out in the public domain which forced Man United’s hand. There is no such thing here.",
      "Another point is that as long as Partey was playing at Arsenal he was not deemed a flight risk. The Police may have even come to an arrangement with Arsenal for this to be the case. I am speculating here. So cant say if this is true.",
      "One thing that is certain is that things changed the moment Partey’s contract ceased at the end of June. Partey could now go abroad. He is a flight risk. The Police needed to move fast. Do they charge him with the evidence they have or take a chance he leaves the Country. It will take too long to seek a warrant to detain him and take his passport so the quickest thing to do is charge him based on what they have.",
      "As the Benjamen Mendy case showed a charge is not the same as guilt. And to charge in this manner may have been rushed. I do not know for sure. All I know is that the CPS must be sure of their evidence to take this step.",
      "We do not know what the outcome would be. The alleged victims need to be provided with support. Partey also needs to be given support as he denies the allegations. We should stop taking sides until the full story comes out in Court. We should stop hammering Arsenal for things we know nothing about and for speculating on what the club knew or did not know.\nMichael O",

      "Football has endemic problem with misogyny\nIt’s open season on Thomas Partey and Arsenal, but they are just the latest in a long, long list here.",
      "I would suggest that people at the behaviour of Solskjaer with regard to Babacar Sarr, and whilst this happened in Norway, before his tenure at United, it still calls into question the character of a man who United employed. It’s a horrible story, and if you take the time to look into it, I promise you’ll look at Ole differently afterwards. And whilst we are at it, didn’t they also re-sign a very famous footballer who paid off an accusation of rape a few years ago?",
      "He is possibly the most telling example of all, here. The highest profile footballer in the game, even now, and this “incident” was completely swept under the carpet with money.",
      "We all know the game is broken here – all round good guy Pep Guardiola stood as a character reference for Benjamin Mendy when he had multiple accusations of rape, and he did so in a completely voluntary capacity, despite admitting that he had no idea how the player behaved, but was happy to stand up in court and call him a “good boy”.",
      "I don’t mean to pick on United or City particularly. Someone in the comments showed today how poorly Liverpool handled the Jon Flanagan situation, and there are countless examples of football clubs acting in a completely amoral manner when it comes to employing people convicted of all manner of dreadful crimes.",
      "The usual suspects in the comments are coming across appallingly, because it is their tribal hatred that is driving these comments, not their concern for the endemic misogyny within the game. Football has a real problem – female fans suffering appalling harassment, women’s football being denigrated all the time, and female football commentators and pundits receiving constant criticism and abuse, most of it fueled by the “logic” that as women, they are simply not qualified to have valid opinions about such a manly sport.",

      "Jota not my favourite Red\nThese past few days, Diogo Jota’s passing has been top of mind each morning and my last thought before bed. Across football many have said something to the effect of not knowing the lad, but still feeling visceral grief as if firsthand, or that it was strange feeling such grief only mostly having seen just the footballing side of him. It’s definitely been strange to try and reconcile.",
      "Having heard others have also struggled to process his passing, I’ve come to resolve some of my parasocial dissonance, believing I’m not acting unknowingly self-performative or subconsciously mining for inorganic emotion. It’s all been genuine. And if I feel this way about it from so far removed, I simply cannot fathom what the players will feel when doors open to preseason this week, or worse yet, the vast depths of sorrow the immediate families of the brothers must feel at every turn.",
      "Last night I finally sat down and watched one of Jota’s goal-compilation videos; I remembered just about every goal he’d ever scored for Liverpool. We’d always known he was a clinical poacher, but seeing years of his goals compressed into one big stack it became resoundingly clear how much variety and creativity he possessed, what a poised finisher he was off either foot or often most impressively, with his head.",
      "Diogo Jota wasn’t ever my favorite Red. I’ve supported the club down the years trying not to spotlight individuals anyway (but twist my arm I’d probably say, as many might, that Steven Gerrard is my all-timer). The reality is, I don’t know too many of our supporters who truly say Jota was their favorite.",
      "But what’s obvious to see is he had all the attributes, all the stardust, all the potential to be a club favorite, and he was ever really only held back by repeated injury and unavailability. If we’d delayed getting a striker this window (perhaps awaiting Isak next summer) this could’ve been the season Jota finally, deservedly went injury free and lit the league up. He had it all, he just needed luck and a truer run of games. He just needed more time.\nEric, Los Angeles CA",
      "",
      "Will normal service be resumed?\nThe untimely death of Diogo Jota and his brother was a tragedy that seemed to touch not only the whole world of football but beyond. Even fans of arch rivals seemed to, for a moment at least, suspend hostilities and pay their respects. Not that I am in any way equating the two, I do recall the British giving Baron Von Richthofen a full military funeral after he was shot down. No matter how much rivalry or animosity there might be on the surface, we can, at times, put that all to one side. Sometimes the worst of times bring out the best in people.",
      "What I am not hopeful for however is how this will all get thrown out the window the first time Liverpool play MUFC. All the sick references to Munich, Hillsborough, etc. will be trotted out. Do these people even realize what they are chanting about? How can you not be embarrassed with yourself or with that persone next to you?",

      "As some players arrive for pre-season while others are still going in the 2024/2025 campaign thanks to the Club World Cup, we’re looking ahead to the World Cup Proper next summer and the transfers that we reckon need to happen in the remaining few weeks of the current window for England to win the big gong.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nDespite Rashford doing everything short of donating body parts in order to force through his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona, he was third choice until about a week ago. But the Nico Williams snub has now put him in pole position for the transfer, in quite the remarkable boon for his career and England’s chances of redressing the balance of their lopsided attack.",
      "Luis Diaz can ‘agree’ to as many transfers as he likes – Liverpool didn’t want to sell him before so surely won’t now, while top target Williams has signed a new deal with Athletic Club having quite reasonably been perturbed by Barcelona’s inability to assure him that he could actually be registered to play football.",
      "Rashford faces the same grim possibility, but these things tend to work out for mega-clubs like Barcelona, and the juice is undoubtedly worth the squeeze for the United academy graduate. Having seen what he did for Villa in six months, it’s hard to imagine Rashford not being brilliant under a manager with an excellent track record of getting the best out of attacking players in a team where it appears to be impossible not to get a shedload of goal contributions as a forward. Ferran Torres got 26 last season.",
      "And while Tuchel already knows that Harry Kane will play as his No.9 with Bukayo Saka on the right and one of the 427 wonderful No.10s as his No.10, there is currently no standout candidate for that left-wing spot. The thought of Anthony Gordon starting there is hardly encouraging as things stand and Tuchel can’t make the same Gareth Southgate mistake of crowbarring a Phil Foden or Cole Palmer into that role.",
      "An in-form Rashford would be ideal and we can’t imagine a better place for him to find and maintain that form than with Barcelona.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nLiverpool aren’t currently willing to pay the £50m up front that Crystal Palace want for Guehi, but an ‘agreement in principle’ between the player and buying club, along with him ‘pushing’ for the transfer suggests a compromise will be reached.",
      "Guehi has understandable concerns over his game time at Anfield as he looks ahead to the World Cup, but has presumably come to the obvious conclusion that he will go straight into the team alongside Virgil van Dijk because a) Ibrahima Konate has made a rod for his own back through his reported desire to be the next free transfer Judas, and b) we’re not convinced Konate is all that anyway as a free-kick mannequin could be made to look half-decent next to the greatest centre-back the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "Guehi looked a bit dodgy against Latvia in March but more than proved his big-tournament worth at the Euros, and a season of Champions League football next to Big Virg would make us feel rather more at ease over what’s currently a lick-your-finger-and-raise-it-to-the-sky position.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s to Crystal Palace’s great credit that they’ve nurtured so many footballers to the point where they should be playing Champions League football, but kudos and hat tips aren’t going to win you trophies… Oh, that’s right, they already bloody won one.",
      "Europa League football came with that wonderful FA Cup win, but whether because he feels like he’s achieved everything he can and more at Palace or he’s been looking wistfully at what best pal Michael Olise’s been doing at Bayern Munich for the last year, Eze is supposedly ‘desperate’ to return to the club that released him at the age of 13.",
      "Part of us thinks “no, f*** you Arsenal, you had your chance”, but we’ve got our England hats on and surely nothing but good can come from Eze and Declan Rice playing together week in, week out.",
      "",
      "Adam Wharton – Staying at Crystal Palace\nWe are in dangerous territory assuming that Eze and Rice will form a partnership at Arsenal that can drip through to England as that sounds suspiciously like Rice in a holding midfield role akin to a tiger walking around an enclosure.",
      "Tuchel doesn’t want a caged Rice but the one who ran all over Real Madrid and embarrassed Jude Bellingham across two legs in the Champions League, but that can only happen if a quality No.6 comes through this season to set him free. We believe that man is Wharton and that the best way for him to stake his claim is to remain at Palace, which is fortunate as we’re guessing Steve Parish would want a bazillion pounds for him if Guehi and Eze are on their way out.",
      "A non-transfer but one we felt worthy of mention as it’s the glaring issue facing Tuchel right now and to offset out guilt at giving the green light to arguably our favourite Premier League team being gutted this summer.",
      "",
      "John Stones – Manchester City to Everton\nStones will likely be looking at his competition for a starting spot at Manchester City and fancy his chances. Neither Abdukodir Khusanov nor Vitor Reis have arrived and demanded a place through their displays and a battle with Manuel Akanji or Nathan Ake to play alongside Ruben Dias is one he’s frequently won.",
      "When fit, of course, which has been so rare as to put Stones in a position that City players appear to often find themselves in under Pep Guardiola, where the manager’s desire to be cautious over the fitness of the perennially injured far outstrips the reality that most footballers need to play football to get fit.",
      "We’re hoping David Moyes has got enough of the Old School still in him not to concern himself with niggles, proximity to Red Zones or that other fancy-schmancy sports science guff and play Stones if he says he’s ready to play, which we assume he will be all of the time during a season before what could be his last big tournament hurrah.",
      "He ticks the Dick Hill marquee-signing box and offers the opportunity of an England partnership forming alongside Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nRasmus Hojlund reportedly wants to stay at Manchester United having spectacularly failed to read the room and Ruben Amorim faces the prospect of the Denmark international doing sod all again up top for United next season as predictably little progress has been made on finding buyers for their overpaid crop of outcasts.",
      "No interested club is daft enough to pay full price for your Alejandro Garnachos, Antonys or Jadon Sanchos in the knowledge that the Red Devils will say yes to any offer to get them out of the club on deadline day.",
      "A £60 move for Watkins is therefore very unlikely, but Villa have shown some interest in United’s pariahs, offering hope of a swap or a separate but very definitely linked PSR-swerving dodgy deal.",
      "While we would be surprised if Watkins joined and banged in goal after goal he would at least be guaranteed a spot in the team, which was far from the case under Unai Emery last season. We want the guy who’s going to play minimal football while watching Kane at the World Cup to have played plenty during the season, thank you very much.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nMadueke was arguably England’s most impressive player against Andorra in June and could absolutely be in the mix for a starting spot next summer if he moves to Arsenal or stays at Chelsea, but this is less about him and more about Starboy.",
      "The injury which kept Bukayo Saka out for a big chunk of last season may be entirely unrelated to him being flogged by Mikel Arteta at an average of 46 games in the previous three campaigns, but as overuse injuries go, a hamstring ping is a common one.",
      "Madueke could play on Arsenal’s left in the same team as Saka but, more importantly for England, in his place on the right on occasion, to save some of his energy and dynamism for the international left-backs who need to feel the Saka pain if the Three Lions are to have any hope.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nHe’s made just four starts at No.10 since his move to Manchester City four years ago and two of his 17 goals for the Citizens have come in those games. That provides fairly good evidence of his value in that role over his typical spot under Pep Guardiola on the left wing, as did his display for England in that role vs Ireland under Lee Carsley in September, when he scored and was seen doing Jack Grealish type things we’ve been denied the joy of watching for far too long.",
      "Guardiola’s negging has given Grealish little option but to leave Manchester City and Napoli are thought to be among those most interested. We’re not quite sure how Antonio Conte might fit Grealish into a line-up with Scott McTominay and Kevin De Bruyne but now we think about it we’re not sure there’s a midfield trio we would rather watch in action.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Newcastle\nAfter his outstanding displays to drive the England U21s to Euros glory we really need to find out just how good Elliott is at football this season, and that’s only going to happen away from Liverpool.",
      "Fulham are interested but we’re guessing Elliott is setting his sights a little higher. Borussia Dortmund offers a sanctuary for lost English souls and will be an attractive option. But if Eddie Howe can – with all due respect – get nine goals and 14 assists out of Jacob Murphy in a season then Elliott must fancy his chances of staking his England claim at St James’ Park.",
      "",
      "Fabian Ruiz – PSG to Manchester United\nA strange one for those hoping for a revitalised Kobbie Mainoo this season and we count ourselves among those crossing our fingers that Ruben Amorim can find a suitable spot for him in his 3-4-3 to allow him to shine for the Red Devils as he did for England at Euro 2024.",
      "But Mainoo’s absence from the team thanks to Ruiz’s arrival would only be short-lived before he usurps a guy who was brilliant for England’s conquerors Spain at Euro 2024 but would arrive at the World Cup bereft of all confidence having had it sapped from him by a year at Old Trafford.",
      "Arsenal are weighing up a swap deal for Eberechi Eze with Andrea Berta ‘determined’ to seal the transfer as soon as possible, according to reports.",
      "Crystal Palace seemed ripe for the vultures and uncertainty over their Europa fate only reinforced those concerns, but Arsenal and Liverpool have floundered.",
      "Newcastle are exploring striker options to replace Callum Wilson, with Ollie Watkins and Yoane Wissa being ‘discussed’, according to reports.",
      "It could cost Man Utd £100m to sign Ollie Watkins this summer as Roma enter the race to sign Rasmus Hojlund, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly pull out of a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo in order to sign another Premier League star and pressure Brentford to lower their price.",

      "Some clubs go all Football Manager with transfer clauses. Spurs are trying to find West Ham’s sweet spot over Mohammed Kudus but an apparent add-on regarding Thomas Frank’s side winning the Premier League and Champions League, as reported by talkSPORT, is unlikely to move things along.",
      "That is not the first transfer clause that a prospective selling club has rejected out of hand. Spurs themselves have previous.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes – Sporting to Spurs\nWest Ham are said to want ‘a more realistic proposal’ for Kudus which guarantees them a greater pay-out up front.",
      "At least Spurs are not now in the midst of a famous trophy drought when pledging payments to clubs in the event they win the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "They had just lost the Champions League final when Bruno Fernandes agreed to make the move to north London – but in echoes of the Viktor Gyokeres carry-on, Sporting president Frederico Varandas stood in the way.",
      "“The only serious offer was from Tottenham and that was £40m plus another £18m in bonuses for winning the Premier League and the Champions League,” he said. “Those are difficult objectives, so we chose not to accept.”",
      "By January, Manchester United came around waving an initial £47m rising to £67.7m at the Portuguese club, who were more amenable to clauses such as Champions League qualification and making 25 starts.",
      "",
      "Declan Rice – West Ham to Arsenal\nWest Ham do not tend to mess around with the old Premier League and Champions League-winning clauses either.",
      "Their laborious staring contest with Arsenal over a move everyone knew would go through involved half-hearted Manchester City hijacks and incessant grumbling over payment structures.",
      "The Gunners had a couple of offers rejected, with one including add-ons for winning either of the two big ones and Rice playing a certain percentage of games.",
      "In the end the £5m add-ons attached to a £100m deal were for the Hammers to receive £1m each time Arsenal simply qualified for the Champions League with Rice starting 60% of games.",
      "Two payments down, three to go.",
      "",
      "Sadio Mane – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nWhile the perennial German champions did eventually get their man, it took a bit more finesse than one might expect.",
      "Mane wanted the move for a fresh challenge and Liverpool were happy to oblige in a continued restructuring of their attack, but Bayern had to get serious first.",
      "After an opening offer of £21m plus an extra £4m in add-ons was scoffed at by Liverpool, Bayern came back to the table with, as reported by the well-connected Paul Joyce of The Times, a bid which could theoretically reach £30m.",
      "Fair enough. That seems like a perfectly sensible progression in negotiations.",
      "Oh hold on. It would have only hit that top figure if Bayern won the Champions League and Mane the Ballon d’Or. Over each season of his three-year contract. So an extra £6.5m in return for Mane becoming the third player to win three consecutive Ballons d’Or simultaneously with Bayern completing only the second Champions League threepeat in history. Sounds about right.",
      "Mane only ended up staying in Bavaria for a single year, with Bayern eliminated in the Champions League quarter-finals as the Senegalese struggled. No wonder Liverpool mocked those ‘laughable’ bonuses.",
      "",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka – Crystal Palace to Man Utd\nThere were a couple of clauses contained within the final deal which saw Wan-Bissaka leave Crystal Palace for Man Utd.",
      "The former likely abandoned any hope of receiving 10% of any subsequent sale of the right-back for more than £50m long before he moved to West Ham for £15m.",
      "More plausible is that 190 appearances for Man Utd supplemented that initial £45m fee with £5m worth of add-ons.",
      "But Man Utd would have had other contingencies written into the transfer if things had gone their way. It was reported during protracted negotiations that Palace were ‘unimpressed’ by the nature of the performance-related clauses, one of which was known to be an additional payment if Wan-Bissaka made 25 Champions League appearances for a club which had just qualified for the Europa League; he has been stuck on 15 since December 2023.",
      "Some outlets went one further and suggested that Man Utd pledged more money if they won the Champions League, despite not advancing beyond the quarter-finals since 2011. In Palace’s eyes, that was fairly accurately deemed by The Guardian ‘to be wildly unrealistic’.",

      "The Ligue Un club were far more receptive to a summer approach. Newcastle had expected to complete a deal for striker Ekitike worth €36m, plus €10m in what were described by French sources as far more ‘easily attainable’ bonuses. Perhaps they started with just qualifying for the Champions League first.",
      "But an injury put the move in doubt and the Magpies moved on to other targets long before Paris Saint-Germain swooped. Eddie Howe probably doesn’t regret waiting a little longer for Alexander Isak instead.",

They will owe Sporting Lisbon £4.2m for each of the first three times the Portuguese is named PFA Player of the Year or takes a spot in the Ballon d’Or top three. The current tally stands at zero in either case.",
      "United tried it again when it came to those complicated talks with Borussia Dortmund over Sancho. Despite having ‘forced the Germans’ into selling the winger in August 2020, Sancho inexplicably remained at the Westfalenstadion for almost 12 more months.",

But not before Dortmund shot down any idea of the overall fee being enhanced by that typical bonus due if Sancho finished high in the Ballon d’Or vote.",
      "As an aside, the last Man Utd player to take a podium place in Ballon d’Or voting was 2008 winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who also finished second in 2007.

Arsenal lost three consecutive games to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, then won four on the trot before imploding against Spurs and Newcastle to confirm their slip to fifth.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",

      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",

      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
