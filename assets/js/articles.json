      "Jamie Carragher has urged Manchester United to part ways with Ruben Amorim this summer. Amorim has endured a dismal reign since replacing Erik ten Hag in November, winning just 16 of his 41 games in charge.",
      "The latest low point came on Wednesday night when United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham. The Red Devils were unable to break down Ange Postecoglou's side, with Brennan Johnson's first-half goal proving to be the difference.",
      "Amorim had been hoping to use this summer's transfer window to overhaul United's squad. That will likely prove to be incredibly difficult, with funding for new signings hard to raise with no European football.",
      "That situation has convinced Carragher that it would be best if Amorim and United parted ways. The Liverpool legend believes that the Red Devils may even have appointed the wrong man back in November.",
      "\"At some point during their post-season review of a dire campaign, someone in the Manchester United boardroom will need the courage to ask the toughest question: 'Did we appoint the wrong manager at the wrong time?'\" Carragher told The Telegraph.",
      "\"With Amorim, you are not just committing to an individual coach. It means spending big on redesigning the squad to meet Amorim’s specific needs in the knowledge that, if he underperforms again next season, his successor will most likely revert to a flat back four.",
      "\"Given the precariousness of United’s finances, which Ratcliffe acknowledged earlier this season, can the club really afford any more expensive mistakes? Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.\"",
      "Amorim himself has admitted he would be happy to leave without compensation should the board decide he is not the right man for the job. The 40-year-old insisted his side had played well in the final and called for faith from club bosses.",
      "\"It's in the future, I'm not going to talk about the future. This loss, the pain of losing this match. I can see it was clear, we were the better team but then we managed not to score again, so it's very hard to win football matches,\" he said.",
      "\"But the guys tried everything to win the game. In the future, we will have time to assess everything. We have to see. We have to see. I know everything that you did [say], I said before you. In this moment, I’m not going to be here defending myself. It’s not my style.",
      "\"In this moment it’s a little bit of faith, so let’s see. If the board and the fans feel I’m not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation, but I will not quite.",
      "\"Again, I’m really confident about my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things. I think I was always really honest with you guys. We didn’t perform perfect today, but we were better than the opponent, and the opponent also played.\""

      "Embattled boss Ruben Amorim had been hoping to be able to bring in a number of players to finally make his system work. But with no European football to attract players and a depleted transfer warchest, bringing in top players will be highly difficult.",
      "The Portugal international has finished as United's top scorer for the second successive season, registering 19 goals and 19 assists in all competitions. His current contract runs until the summer of 2027 with the option of a further year.",
      "But their is now increasing doubts that Fernandes will see out the rest of that deal. Saudi Pro League side Hilal are pushing to sign the midfielder and are ready to tap into their country's huge wealth reserves.",
      "According to The Athletic FC podcast, the offer from Hilal is a 'genuine' one. It is claimed the Saudi side are ready to offer around £80m for Fernandes, who turns 31 in September.",
      "That opens ahead of the Club World Cup, running from 1 June to 10 June. Fernandes is understood to be on the list of players Hilal are looking to target heading into this summer's tournament.",
      "United signed Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon for £68m back in January 2020. Fernandes would have the chance to link up with compatriots João Cancelo and Ruben Neves if he did join Hilal.",
      "But it may take some convincing for Fernandes to depart Old Trafford this summer. Following the defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, the skipper made it clear he saw his future as being with United.",
      "\"I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" Fernandes said. \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days.",

      "Big calls have been made with Manchester United placing every player on the transfer list after their Europa League final heartbreak. Ruben Amorim failed to salvage his miserable first season in charge as defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao ensured there would be no European football for the Red Devils next season.",
      "And now the autopsy begins with Amorim ready to rip up his underperforming squad, with some unpopular decisions set to be made. That includes potentially cashing in on some of the club's academy graduates, with one perhaps at the front of the queue.",
      "While the defeat to Spurs added a final stamp of misery on their season, Amorim faced further annoyance minutes after the final whistle after Alejandro Garnacho's address to the assembled media in the San Mames Stadium.",
      "The United youth product's comments after the defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao is enough to be shown the door quickly by the United hierarchy after making a thinly-veiled dig to his boss so soon after the defeat.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" said Garnacho. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "To make things worse, his brother, Roberto, added fuel to the fire by describing how Alejandro was \"thrown under the bus\" by the former Sporting coach upon learning he will be on the bench. Now, Amorim has to respond harshly and take a leaf out of Sir Alex Ferguson's book and show Garnacho the door rather than make it look like the Spanish-born Argentine has full control of the situation.",
      "Sir Alex never stuttered when it came to those who dared question him or fall out with him during his tenure as United boss. Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Roy Keane were all stalwarts during their careers at Old Trafford but one wrong step in the manager's eyes and you were gone without a second thought.",
      "It is not like it was an off-the-cuff comment either from the Madrid-born player. Just hours before the final even started, Garnacho posted pictures on his Instagram page celebrating after scoring the opening goal in the FA Cup final last season - which United went on to win against arch-rivals Manchester City. This is not a player who is just assessing his options. This is a player who is clearly controlling the narrative and the sooner that is shut down the better for Amorim if he is to maintain harmony in the dressing room as the season closes.",
      "Garnacho has crossed the line and now he has to face the consequences of this after questioning Amorim in the press. It will be the 40-year-old's first major test going into the summer transfer window as he looks to make a significant impact in the summer for the Red Devils.",
      "He has made the right move with the \"back me or sack me\" ultimatum (or bluff depending on how you have interpreted it) to the board but now he really needs to make an impact on the dressing room. It is not like the board will be reluctant either. He has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford in the previous transfer window - with Chelsea (currently at 4/1 to sign the Argentina international) previously rumoured to acquire his services with their ever-growing list of wingers - with the decision-makers at the club willing to listen in the past.",
      "No doubt Sir Jim Ratcliffe is licking his lips at the prospect of a big PSR win when selling the 20-year-old as the minority shareholder seeks a financial boost.",
      "It is a win-win situation for the Portuguese coach as he looks to really make his mark at United with the season set to end. Having previously stated he wanted to join United this summer instead of November last year, the former Benfica midfielder has endured six torrid months with the resources at his disposal with a squad who endured their worst ever Premier League campaign and worst league campaign in almost 50 years",
      "There can be no leeway with this - Amorim needs to act.",

      "The former Atalanta star has thrived under Ruben Amorim this season even as others have struggled. He earned minutes under Amorim's predecessor Erik ten Hag, scoring some important goals last term, but really came into his own under the Portuguese and scored his first United hat-trick against Southampton in January.",
      "Amad also signed a contract extension in January, with the new deal keeping him at Old Trafford in January. While others may well leave this summer, his comments suggest he's determined to put things right at his current club rather than moving on.",

      "\"I promise you that a season like this will never happen again at this great club. Thank you all for your support throughout the season; you've been by our side no matter what.\"",
      "United were without Amad for much of the second half of the season, a period where their league results suffered. An ankle injury kept him out of 10 straight league games, with the club's only victories during the run coming against bottom-three sides Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "The 22-year-old also missed European victories over Real Sociedad and Lyon, but returned to play a part in the semi-final triumph over Athletic Club. Ruben Amorim backed him to start in the final against Spurs, but few of United's players were able to assert themselves in a disappointing 1-0 reverse.",
      "Speaking to the media after the defeat, United boss Amorim shed some more light on what the club will be able to do in the transfer market. “We have two plans, even for the market and we need to understand it’s tough for a club like ours not to be in the Champions League,\" he said.",
      "\"But we have to use the other side. If we have more time, we have more time to think, to work during the week and to be better in the Premier League. That will be our focus.”",
      "United have one final Premier League game ahead of them, with Aston Villa visiting Old Trafford on Sunday. Unai Emery's side need three points to give themselves a chance of qualifying for the Champions League, but unlike United they are at least guaranteed some form of European football next term."

      "It seems he could get his wish, given Deco’s comments. \"We like Luis, we like Rashford, and we like other players,\" Deco told Catalan radio station RAC 1. \"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",

      "\"The renewals of Raphinha, [Frenkie] De Jong, and Eric [Garcia] will come, for sure. That's the priority. We'll talk about improving the team if we can, but the key is stability. We don't believe that players will ask to leave.\"",

Luckily, they have a generational talent on their books in the form of Lamine Yamal, who Deco says has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain. Unsurprisingly, Barca would never consider selling. Instead they are plotting a new contract.",
      "\"Lamine has not asked for anything because we don't speak to players but to agents,\" he said. \"That's not his priority. I think a player has to have a contract that is fair, that corresponds to his value and I think that's what we're going to do.",
      "“You have to adapt Lamine's contract to his reality. He has to be the most important player among the most important players we have. He surely has other things that the others don't have.\""

      "Alan Shearer has tipped Ruben Amorim to leave Manchester United in the wake of their defeat in the Europa League final. United were beaten by Tottenham on Wednesday night in Bilbao.",
      "The 40-year-old has won just 16 of the 41 games he has taken of since replacing Erik ten Hag in November. He even admitted after Wednesday's defeat that he would be happy to leave his post should the board decide he is not the right man for the job.",
      "While it is understood that United bosses are content with Amorim for now, Shearer is unconvinced over his long-term future. The Newcastle legend has delivered a scathing assessment of the current state of the club.",
      "And he believes things are so bad at Old Trafford that Amorim could even move on this summer. Shearer insisted that Amorim did not realise the scale of the challenge that was facing him, but admitted United had become 'much worse'.",
      "\"There will be a lot of questions around Ruben Amorim’s future now and very much like the Spurs situation, it wouldn't surprise me if he wasn't the manager at the beginning of the season. Whether that's his choice or not, I guess,\" he told Betfair.",
      "\"I've said it so many times, there's no way he's gone into that football club and expected what he found. There's no way he thought it was that bad. He couldn't have, because I'm not sure you'd go. He hasn't helped the situation.",
      "\"They've actually got so much worse under him. It might have been papering over the cracks if they had won the Europa League, but their problems were summed up in that 97 minutes: no creativity, no legs, no energy, no goals, and a complete mess.\"",
      "Shearer believes that it will be incredibly difficult for United to turn their fortunes around quickly. He made an early predicition that next season will be another campaign without any silverware for the Red Devils.",
      "\"It's a mess at Manchester United. Much like Spurs, their season was this competition. We've been seeing it for the last two or three months that both clubs needed to win this competition to salvage something from their season,\" Shearer added.",
      "\"Financially, it will hurt them to attract the players they wanted because they're not Man United from 20 years ago, where most players wanted to go there. They're not that football club anymore; they're only that club by name.",
      "\"They don't deserve to win the Europa League or be in the Champions League. They've been awful all season in every department. The final basically just summed up their season as a whole: slow, terrible in front of the goal, no threat, no energy, and really poor.",
      "\"Are they going to be in the market for top players now? Top players want to play in the Champions League and challenge for trophies. Are Man United going to be challenging for trophies next season? I think the simple answer is no, they're not.\""

      "Manchester United are at rock bottom following their miserable defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final. For the pessimists there is more misery on the horizon, but for the optimists it means the only way is up.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens this summer, with an absolutely crucial transfer window on the horizon. United know they need to make wholesale changes – and that’s why Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken the unprecedented step of placing the entire squad at risk of being sold.",
      "Nobody is above the axe of Ratcliffe, who has already made hundreds of United staff redundant and has made it very clear that he’s not motivated by winning popularity contests. The sign has been put into the front lawn: United are clearing out their garage and everyone has a price. Let the bidding commence.",
      "United paid Inter Milan £43million for Onana. He’s coming up to two years as United’s number one and it’s clear that it just hasn’t worked out. His fated ability to play out from the back hasn’t had any tangible benefit and, instead, we’ve been treated to the occasional howler. Yet he is still one of the players who has some sell-on value, so make the most of it. SELL.",
      "Hard to judge the Turkish keeper, who has only played 10 times for United in two seasons. When he has played, like in the 4-1 defeat by Newcastle in April, he didn’t cover himself in glory, making a dreadful error. But, to be brutally honest, United have bigger fish to fry than their second-choice goalkeeper. KEEP.",
      "Look up ‘good man to have around the dressing room’ in the football cliche dictionary and it is likely that Heaton will be cited. But at 39 years old, and with his contract about to expire, the time has come to hang up your boots, Tom. RELEASE.",
      "The Swede has been at United since 2017 and if we’re being brutally honest – which we are – he has never really been good enough to be a mainstay at such a club. With his contract up on June 30, his final act as a United player will be getting a yellow card for shouting at the fourth official in Bilbao. RELEASE.",
      "One of the summer arrivals in Erik ten Hag’s ill-fated final transfer window. A solid if unspectacular defender, who does have the benefit of being able to play in a few positions. Does he have the legs to play as a wingback in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation? I’m not convinced, but we can’t flog everyone. KEEP.",
      "Has had an injury-hit debut campaign with United and looks a long way off the much-hyped Ajax youngster of his heyday. He cost United £42.9m from Bayern Munich in the summer and is a classic example of their poor recruitment. SELL.",
      "I love Maguire. But watching him flail around in the Spurs penalty area, desperately trying to affect the game, while fighting with Cristian Romero, looked a lot like the death knell of a football team. Amorim essentially put the big lad up top and hoped. It is time to move on from Maguire. SELL.",
      "It feels like a long, long time since we were debating whether a 5ft 9in centre-back could hack it in the Greatest League In the World™. The diminutive defender has been out injured for some time, which has the effect of increasing his stock during miserable times like these. KEEP.",
      "Coming to a quiz near you as a pointless answer in about 10 years. SELL.",
      "Signed in January, Dorgu has at times looked like the sort of left wing-back Amorim requires. He has the athleticism to get up and down the wing, a solid left foot and appears to have a pretty high ceiling. KEEP.",
      "United beat Real Madrid to the signing of Yoro, but have been dismayed to see him injured for much of this season. Still only 19 years old, the Frenchman needs to stay injury-free and have some stability around him. KEEP.",
      "Injuries have taken their toll on Shaw, who is United’s longest-serving current player having joined the club way back in 2014. It is crazy that he still has two years left on his deal. Ratcliffe is not afraid of taking tough decisions and getting rid of the England defender is one that needs doing. SELL.",
      "Has been one of the strong performers over the past few seasons and appears to be a good fit for Amorim’s tactical system. Dalot also seems like a leader in the dressing room – and considering I’m getting rid of a lot of them – he is worth keeping. KEEP.",
      "One of few bright lights in a dark, dark season. Heaven was pinched from Arsenal and showed plenty of promise when he played. KEEP.",
      "A veteran player who has been a model professional for United. But he’s 37 years old and out of contract next month. RELEASE.",
      "The young defender has broken into the first team this season and is one of a few players who is flying the flag for the famous United academy. KEEP.",
      "Pre-season will be indicative for Fredricson, who like Amass has got a taste of first-team football. Amorim will know whether he has a shot, but a loan spell might be more appropriate. KEEP.",
      "Judged by numbers only, Mount has been a dreadful buy for £55m. He has four goals and one assist in 45 appearances for United. But, now he’s fit again, he needs to kick on and prove himself as a No.10 in Amorim’s shape. There is absolutely no chance United can sell him, so they better hope he turns up next season. KEEP.",
      "Right then. United’s best player and captain. The source of 19 goals and 19 assists this season. But also a player who has concrete interest from the Saudi Pro League. I would take the gamble and sell up. United need to change their culture and – rightly or wrongly – Fernandes has become the embodiment of their malaise. He will fetch a good price and, considering he turns 31 in September, it could prove smart business in hindsight. The only problem is replacing him without the allure of European football… SELL.",
      "A very very simple decision. Hasn’t been good enough for about two years. A player well past his peak. Thankfully, his contract is up. RELEASE.",
      "The man referenced by Ratcliffe as embodying the wasteful recruitment model of the United of old. The former Real Madrid man is past his best and the image of him running through quicksand, trying to catch up to Spurs players on the break, will stick with me. Off he goes to Saudi Arabia. SELL.",
      "United went through an awful lot of faff to sign Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer and didn’t get much for their £50m. However, the Uruguay international cannot be written off yet. He has the right profile to replace Casemiro and should be given the chance to step up. KEEP.",
      "Like everyone else in the squad, Mainoo is up for sale, but really he shouldn’t be. He is a talented young Mancunian who represents a link to the club’s fans. He is a supremely gifted youngster with the ability to develop into a great box-to-box midfielder. He just needs to be managed well and not burdened. KEEP.",
      "I’m not sure that Collyer has the ability to make a mark on United next season. SELL.",
      "The fact he was loaned out to Rotherham in January says a lot. SELL.",
      "I feel sorry for Hojlund. He clearly isn’t a £72m player. He should not be burdened with the goalscoring demands that come with being United’s first-choice No.9. The Dane is too inexperienced for the role he’s inherited. He should either be an understudy to an experienced striker, or sold to sign such a player. Reports in Italy suggest United could flog him back to where he came from. If that doesn’t happen then he can take up the role he should’ve had in the first place. KEEP.",
      "There is no going back from December when Amorim froze him out. He wants a new challenge and should be given it, with his spell on loan at Aston Villa doing his sale value no harm. SELL.",
      "United’s interest in Matheus Cunha is not good news for Zirkee, who is at his best dropping off the back line into space. The difference is Cunha is more talented and has scored a lot more goals this season for Wolves. Zirkzee may still have admirers abroad. United should call them up. SELL.",
      "One of few success stories from a terrible spell of recruitment. The young winger is a joy to watch and, if he hadn’t been injured this season, could have led United to a few more wins (just remember how good that last-minute Manchester Derby winner was). KEEP.",
      "Garnacho strongly hinted at a summer departure in the wake of the defeat by Spurs. He has been linked with Chelsea and Napoli and, to be frank, United should cash in because his end product is severely lacking. He has six goals and two assists in 36 Premier League appearances. Get rid. SELL.",
      "The Brazilian has turned into a different player since joining Real Betis on loan, but it would be foolish to think he would simply bring that form to Old Trafford if United recalled him. It would be much wiser to cut your losses on the £82m Ten Hag flop. SELL.",
      "Wayne Rooney said he felt sorry for Obi when watching him play against Brentford recently, with United showing no idea of how to utilise the youngster. The hope is that, with better team-mates, he can come good. KEEP.",
      "Another tale of waste at United. Sancho cost £73m from Borussia Dortmund but never got close to repaying that fee. He hasn’t done an awful lot on loan at Chelsea, but luckily they have an obligation to buy the winger. SELL."

      "A 1-0 win over Manchester United in Bilbao meant Spurs lifted the Europa League - their first piece of silverware in 17 years - as well as securing a place in next season’s Champions League.",
      "The result helped to salvage a season which has seen Spurs endure their worst domestic season in almost 50 years. Going into the final game of the Premier League season, the North Londoners are 17th in the table, having slumped to a staggering 21 league defeats.",
      "It now remains to be seen whether their European exploits will be enough to convince Daniel Levy that Postecoglou deserves a third season in the Spurs dugout. But the Daily Mail reports that Tottenham ’s players do not expect that to happen, with a change now deemed more likely.",
      "The report adds that alternatives to Postecoglou are already being discussed by Levy, with Fulham boss Marco Silva one of the names in the frame this summer. Brennan Johnson, who was credited with the winning goal over United, suggested that winning the trophy would be the perfect ‘mic drop’ for the manager.",
      "Captain Son Heung-min made it clear that he wants the 59-year-old to stay with the club. He said: “He won the trophy. Nobody else did it, so - look, it’s not up to me or the players, but we just have to look at the facts.",
      "“At the fact that we hadn’t won in 17 years, but this is the day we finally won it. It’s the manager who wins the trophy. So we'll see what’s going to happen.”",
      "Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario echoed Son's impassioned plea for Postecoglou to stay and said: “Yeah, of course. He’s my gaffer. He’s the person who decided to bring me to this club. I just have to be very thankful to him for how much he believed since day one, since he wanted me to sign for the club.",

The decision by Whiteside and his wife, Dee, to not renew their season tickets comes a year after they were forced to move their seats at Old Trafford to accommodate executive seating.",
      "In a post on X, Dee Whiteside expressed her disappointment: \"So, I've waited for a while to write this. It is with unbelievable sadness, that after more than 28 years of having season tickets at Old Trafford, @NormanWhiteside and I are not renewing next year.",
      "\"And to cap it all, we've seen it all, we've won the lot, we're Man United and we're never gonna stop... except for so many seasons now, my match-going loyalty to my club has ended so sadly.",
      "\"I'll still be at games, I'm MUFC until I die, and I've seen worse times than now, but I'm not sure I've seen players less interested in pulling on our shirt for very many years. Times must change.\"",
      "Whiteside and his wife, are platinum season ticket holders at Old Trafford, by virtue of having the seats for more than 25 years, but will now walk away. United's decision to move season ticket holders from block S122 at Old Trafford was reported by the MEN last year, a change that impacted the Whitesides.",
      "A spokesperson for United acknowledged: \"We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations.",
      "\"There are various reasons why this happens, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders - in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.\"",
      "During his tenure in Manchester, Whiteside set records as the youngest player to score in both FA Cup and League Cup finals. The Northern Irishman also surpassed Pele's record to become the youngest player to participate in a World Cup, representing his country at the tender age of 17 years and 40 days.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been offered an exit route from Manchester United after their defeat in the Europa League final. United are braced for sweeping changes in the summer transfer window after missing out on Champions League football next season by losing to Tottenham – and their captain could be among those leaving.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is ready to take a brutal stance this summer in order to furnish Ruben Amorim with a fresh squad for the 2025/26 season. United want to bring in Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and Ipswich striker Liam Delap, but only have around £100million to spend before taking into account sales.",
      "Fernandes is under contract with United until June 2027, while the club also have the option of a further year. But the 30-year-old admitted in the aftermath of defeat in Bilbao that he would understand if United sold him – and that has now become a real possibility.",
      "That approach was rejected by his representatives, but Al-Hilal have not given up and Fernandes’ honest comments to the media in northern Spain will have given them hope a deal can be reached.",
      "“If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this,” he said.",
      "“I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.”",
      "Fernandes joined United in January 2020 from Sporting Lisbon for £68million and has been a key player ever since. He has contributed 98 goals and 86 assists in 289 appearances for the club and has been captain since Erik ten Hag replaced Harry Maguire two summers ago.",
      "He has been United’s stand-out performer this season with 19 goals and 19 assists in 56 appearances. But with United 16th in the Premier League and facing a year without any European football, Ratcliffe is ready to oversee a brutal fire sale this summer.",
      "While loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are the primary targets for sales, there is a feeling that the club will have to offload some key players too. Amorim has described Fernandes as one of the best players in the world and dismissed previous rumours around him, but the decision could be taken out of his hands this summer."

      "Tottenham’s victory in the Europa League final has been recognised in UEFA’s official team of the tournament. Spurs beat Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao on Wednesday night to secure their first trophy since 2008 and to vindicate under-pressure manager Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Brennan Johnson’s scrappy goal just before half-time was enough for Spurs to end their 17-year wait for a major trophy and ensure United ended their miserable season on a new low. United dominated the ball but could not break down a determined low block from Spurs.",
      "When they did fashion chances, they found Guglielmo Vicario in decent form, with the goalkeeper keeping out efforts from Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw. Postecoglou is known for implementing an expansive playing style, but he took a much more pragmatic approach in the San Mames and was rewarded with his customary trophy in his second season.",
      "Tottenham’s players were seen dancing with joy and sharing the moment with their supporters – and four of them have now been given another honour. UEFA have announced their team of the Europa League and Spurs’ impressive rear guard in the final has been recognised.",
      "Spurs kept six clean sheets during the competition and Vicario has been named the best keeper in the competition. Right-back Pedro Porro was the team’s biggest threat against United, swinging in lots of good crosses, while he dealt well with Mason Mount and Garnacho in defence.",
      "He is joined in the team of the tournament by captain-for-the-night Cristian Romero, who has the extra honour of being the player of the tournament. The combative Argentine was in the thick of things in Bilbao, battling with Harry Maguire in the closing stages.",
      "Finally, the Spurs contingent is completed by striker Dominic Solanke, who worked tirelessly up front in the final. He finished the competition with five goals and four assists in 13 appearances, justifying the club-record £65million Spurs paid Bournemouth for his services.",
      "It won’t come as any consolation to them right now, but United’s defeated finalists have two inclusions in the form of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. The duo formed United’s midfield against Spurs, and although they came up short, they were the most consistent performers in the rest of the tournament.",
      "Frankfurt defender Robin Koch, Bodo/Glimt pair Fredrik Andre Bjorkan and Patrick Berg, Lyon star Rayan Cherki and Athletic Club’s Nico Williams complete the line-up. Cherki scored in both games against United and has been linked with a summer transfer.",
      "The Lyon forward is reportedly being eyed by five Premier League clubs after racking up 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances in all competitions. Meanwhile, Williams is a long-term target of Arsenal.",

This Thursday, we're featuring everything from the shock news that Labour are exploring mandatory castration in a brutal paedophile crackdown to Man Utd's financial woes after losing the Europa League final.",
      "Late last night, news broke that Labour were exploring mandatory chemical castration for paedophiles and rapists under plans to curb sex offenders' vile urges. Elsewhere, it was revealed Manchester United will listen to offers for every player in the wake of their European defeat and two CBB stars finally confirmed their rumoured romance.",
      "Early this morning, our politics team revealed that Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is exploring whether chemical castration of sex offenders can be made mandatory. Jailed offenders could be forced to undergo hormonal treatment to curb their sexual urges in a move to prevent reoffending.",
      "A voluntary scheme will see sex offenders chemically castrated in two regions in England, covering 20 prisons, as a first step to rolling out nationwide. But Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is also exploring whether the approach could be made mandatory, rather than just voluntary.",
      "A major review of sentencing, chaired by former Justice Secretary David Gauke and published today, called for more evidence to be gathered on chemical castration - a drug treatment that reduces hormone levels to curb libido. It wants a small pilot, which involves a few dozen inmates in the South West of England, to be continued.",

      "In the wake of their defeat in the Europa League yesterday evening, our sports team revealed Manchester United will listen to offers for EVERY player on their team. No player will be immune from being sold - including captain Bruno Fernandes – as United face up to a catastrophic financial black hole.",
      "The crushing 1-0 loss to Tottenham in Bilbao saw United blow a place in next season's Champions League - and with it £100million in revenue. Defeat to Spurs means United will not play in Europe at all next season, for only the second time in 35 years and means further cutbacks at the club that has already seen mass redundancies",
      "United's failure in Bilbao means they also face missing out on signing their top summer targets, including Liam Delap, Matheus Cunha and Victor Osimhen. Without the additional revenue from European games, United will have no choice but to sell players to raise funds for Ruben Amorim to strengthen his squad.",

      "Beth, from Portsmouth, unfortunately passed away a day after she was admitted to hospital on April 28 - but her husband Luke's heartbreak has not ended there as a shocking discovery was made after her death. A UK autopsy revealed doctors had removed her heart without her family's knowledge.",
      "Beth had travelled on April 27 with Luke and her two children, aged five and eight, but her family now says they are being kept in the dark about what happened to the beloved mother. It is understood that Beth fell ill soon after the Martin family landed at the airport.",

      "If Alejandro Garnacho has to apologise for his abrupt comments on Ruben Amorim's team selection, it will not be the first time the Manchester United forward has been in this position. Garnacho, 20, was clearly furious with Amorim after the Europa League final.",
      "The Argentinian winger was named on the bench for the 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao. Amorim did introduce the United academy graduate for Mason Mount, but not until the 71st minute.",
      "The South American was evidently not satisfied with the amount of time he was given to make an impact, as after the match, he lambasted the United head coach for leaving him out of the starting XI. He also described his side's campaign as \"s***\".",
      "It's not the first time Garnacho has criticised his manager, though. He was previously reprimanded by Erik ten Hag, after he was caught engaging with a social media post criticising the Dutchman. Garnacho 'liked' a tweet on X – formerly known as Twitter – that slated Ten Hag for hooking the forward off at half time during United's 2-2 away draw with Bournemouth last season.",
      "When asked about the matter later on, Ten Hag drew a line under the situation and said: \"Alejandro is a young player, he has to learn a lot. He apologised for it and after that we move on.\"",
      "Just over a year later, Garnacho has found himself in the headlines for criticising his boss again. Instead of liking a post, the 20-year-old spoke to the media after the final in Bilbao, and said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Making matters worse, his brother Roberto backed up his sibling on social media in a dig at Amorim. He took to Instagram and wrote: \"Working as no-one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe hahahahahaha.\"",
      "It remains to be seen if Amorim responds to Garnacho's comments and those of his brother, but he will likely be quizzed on the matter on Friday in his pre-match press conference. United host Aston Villa at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday – their final match of the campaign.",
      "Amorim, however, defended his decision to snub the Argentine to begin with in Bilbao and deploy Mount in his position instead.",
      "The Portuguese boss even had a dig at Garnacho himself when he said: \"How many times have we had this conversation, and it was the opposite? Some players come in, like Mason Mount, against Bilbao and changed the game.",
      "\"So now it is easy to say. Who missed the big opportunity in the first half against Bilbao? Yeah [Garnacho]. Of course, now it is easy for us to talk about a lot of views.\"",
      "Garnacho was heavily linked with moves to Napoli and Chelsea in January, but neither deal materialised. His future could now well depend on Amorim's reaction to his public comments and his brother's post, with a sale still very possible in the summer, especially after United made every player available for the right price off the back of their damaging defeat to Spurs.",

      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot has become a Premier League champion at the first time of asking, and points to one of the Reds' first games of the season as a key moment. Slot had big shoes to fill after replacing long-serving boss Jurgen Klopp, but a subtle tweak he made in just the third game of the season had a big impact.",
      "After beginning the season with 2-0 victories over Ipswich and Brentford, Liverpool faced a big early test with a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United. A 3-0 win kept up their perfect start, though, while accelerating the United decline which saw Erik ten Hag sacked in Octoner.",
      "Liverpool's victory owed a lot to Slot putting Dominik Szoboszlai directly up against Casemiro. United's Brazilian midfielder had a torrid time, leaving the field at half-time, and the visitors were never in any real danger during their victory.",
      "\"Just recently some Dutch media asked me: ‘What was the game where you probably won the players over?’ I think it was this game because we changed some small details in the way we did our build up,\" Slot told The Athletic",
      "\"I said to them that United would be expecting Dominik Szoboszlai to play on the right. That they will have prepared all week for it, but he’s going to play on the left and we’re going to do this, this and this a bit different. Indeed exactly what I said happened.\"",
      "Liverpool were 2-0 up at the break after a Luis Diaz break and extended their advantage 10 minutes into the second half through Mohamed Salah. Slot's team lost their next league game, at home to Nottingham Forest, but then went on an unbeaten league run which lasted until April.",
      "\"Did we win the game because of that reason? No. We scored two counter-attacks, maybe even three!\" Slot added. \"But I think it was a day when the players thought: ‘Oh, what he’s trying to tell us works’. And to win 3-0 at Old Trafford gave us the confidence that there was maybe something special ahead of us.\"",
      "Since clinching the title with a 5-1 victory over Tottenham at the end of April, Liverpool have gone three games without a win. They have a chance to go out on a high, though, with Crystal Palace visiting Anfield for the final game of the season.",
      "\"It's going to be a completely different game than the one tonight,\" Slot told Match of the Day when asked about the finale after Monday's 3-2 loss at Brighton. \"You saw Brighton want to press us high and bring the ball out from the back but if Palace play like their cup final then we'll have more possession than tonight but it's very difficult to play through them.\""

      "United's wallets will be hit. There will be a derisory merit payment for what could be a 17th-place finish in the Premier League, no European revenue, no matchday revenue in the Champions League and a penalty clause invoked in the Adidas deal. Roughly, that is an £80million black hole.",
      "They have squandered nearly £15m keeping Erik ten Hag and then hiring and firing Dan Ashworth. There is also the £200m they largely misspent on players in Ten Hag's last transfer window.",
      "2019 was the year of the 'cultural reset' at United. Reset, revamp or reboot, none of those words do United's current position justice. Without relegation (never a tangible threat), they are at rock bottom.",
      "They have to frame next season positively. Free midweeks for Ruben Amorim to coach the players to within an inch of their lives, ample rest between matches and the motivation to ensure United do not end up anywhere near to where they are now.",
      "Here is a five-point plan to make United a force again:",
      "More proactivism, less pragmatism",
      "Amorim has agonised over whether to play pragmatically or proactively. In Bilbao, he did neither. Alejandro Garnacho was benched as Mason Mount retained the faith of a coach who \"loves\" him yet overlooked the fact that the playmaker is not as much of a goal threat as Garnacho. And United did not score for the 16th time.",
      "One of the accusations levelled at Mount is he does little with the ball. Amorim bristled at the suggestion he had got it wrong by starting Mount, reminding this correspondent that Garnacho missed a one-on-one in the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao, a match Mount emerged in to end the Spanish side's chances of a comeback.",
      "Mount's fleeting purple patch consisted of three goals in two games and he did not play 90 minutes in either. Garnacho had started 14 successive games until his 'rest' for the defeat against West Ham. That he remained on the bench at Chelsea five days later was significant.",
      "Had Leny Yoro not recovered from a foot injury, Amorim would have started the same side that lost at Chelsea. United were competitive for around an hour at Stamford Bridge when matches last for 90 minutes. They managed one attempt on target. Garnacho forced Guglielmo Vicario to dive down to his left within minutes of his belated arrival on Wednesday night.",
      "United also had glaring issues in midfield against Spurs: full backs as wingers. Noussair Mazraoui admitted last week he is more settled as a right centre back as it is the closest position to playing at right back. Mazraoui is not an attack-minded winger and United offered no threat down Tottenham's left-hand side when they ought to have doubled up on the shaky Destiny Udogie.",
      "Bruno Fernandes seemed to have been reinvented as a central midfielder before the March internationals. Then he moved forward again when United's season resumed at Nottingham Forest. Suddenly, he was back in midfield for the dress rehearsal at Chelsea. Amorim maybe wanted some finesse in midfield against the conservative trio of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr but Fernandes, United's top scorer, had to be in the front three for the final.",
      "Mazraoui should be considered a centre half from next season and United need an upgrade on the right wing. Amorim played wingers in the 3-4-2-1 system at Sporting yet has settled on full backs at United. The ends have not justified the means yet United have already invested £25million in the Danish left back Patrick Dorgu, who started by default in Bilbao.",
      "Compromise with youngsters",
      "Garnacho is becoming a problem for United. Like Marcus Rashford before him, he has developed an inflated air of entitlement and it should startle United that a 20-year-old brazenly sounded off about a \"s**t\" season, criticised the manager's decision to drop him and cast doubt on his future. His gobby brother had also joined in online.",
      "The authority of the United manager's role should always be protected but Garnacho is a nuanced case. There has been a willingness from the player and coach to make it work since he was dropped from the Manchester derby squad on December 15 and Amorim has enthused about the adjustments Garnacho has made to his game.",
      "Garnacho remains one of a handful of fan favourites. He was serenaded when he warmed up at San Mames and there was a bullish roar when he was ordered back to come on. He was seen as such an ally of Amorim's he flanked him for the pre-match press conference for the semi-final second leg against Athletic.",
      "United are renowned for wingers and Garnacho is one of the academy's biggest success stories this century. Only Garnacho jars with Amorim's system and a new number 10, Matheus Cunha, is expected to occupy one of those two roles behind the striker.",
      "There has been interest in Garnacho and there is an obvious temptation for United to cash in. He would represent pure profit, you can't tolerate any player publicly questioning the manager and he does not naturally fit into the system.",
      "Napoli, on the verge of a fourth Scudetto, wanted Garnacho in January and deemed him worthy of replacing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Antonio Conte, the Napoli coach, oversaw one of Eden Hazard's greatest seasons at Chelsea. Those are ringing endorsements United should be wary of.",
      "All parties need to sit around a table, thrash out their differences and seek a compromise. That also applies to Kobbie Mainoo, the poster boy of United's future as recently as the start of this season but no longer a regular. Amorim has misgivings about Mainoo as a midfielder and has trialled him as a playmaker and a striker with mixed results.",
      "It would be beyond bold for United to cash in on Mainoo and/or Garnacho when it is not a stretch to imagine them requiring a new manager in the autumn. United can improve with Amorim, Garnacho and Mainoo all on the bus, despite Garnacho's brother claiming he was thrown under it.",
      "Recruit for the club, not the manager",
      "If United fans were given the choice between Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres the majority would opt for the latter. Gyokeres is older and more proven, albeit in a much weaker league, and United know all-too-well the pitfalls of stockpiling players schooled outside one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Gyokeres would be a legitimate exception, yet United have settled on Delap. The dynamic suddenly shifts as the scrutiny would be on Jason Wilcox, rather than Amorim. Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed Wilcox possesses \"the best eyes in football\" and he has not looked far for United's next starting striker, having watched Delap develop at City when he was the head of their academy.",
      "United's recruitment will be severely impacted by the absence of European football from their schedule next season. Cunha and Delap are attainable through release clauses. That feels like a cop-out with Delap, only four days younger than the dismal Rasmus Hojlund. They have a -12 goal difference. They cannot cut corners with the striker's role.",
      "Last year, United operated by a one for the manager, one for the board policy. Ten Hag reunited with Ajax alumni but also integrated two signings from the French league with no links to Dutch football. Leny Yoro should have ushered in a very different recruitment era at United, only their next arrival was the Dutchman Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The mid-season signings of Dorgu and Ayden Heaven have offered a glimpse of what could come this summer and beyond. But the worst United side in 51 years needs proven commodities, particularly if Bruno Fernandes heads for the Riyadh retirement home.",
      "Expendable culture",
      "United are bound to be saddled with some immovable players. Luke Shaw was raw in the San Mames mixed zone, questioning if he is good enough. We all know the answer and he should, too. He is not going to put his own contract through the shredder two years before its expiry date.",
      "Nobody should be off-limits if United receive an acceptable offer. How could they be after a season like this one? That applies to Garnacho and Mainoo. If they want a change of scenery then that is the clincher.",
      "Jose Mourinho was standing in the doorway when he spoke to some of us in San Jose in 2018 and said he would not stand in the way of Anthony Martial, who wanted to leave. But Ed Woodward did. Ratcliffe was still cursing Woodward's methods as recently as March. United have let innumerable players outstay their welcome and Martial was one of them. Shaw is another. Victor Lindelof, too.",
      "The profitability and sustainability rules have influenced the length of contracts but United have got to stop doling out five-year deals like a volunteer with leaflets on Deansgate. Shorter contracts would keep players on their toes. Amorim's deal only has two years left to run and he will be judged much sooner than 2027.",
      "A new fall-guy at hierarchical level",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford sunk his claws into Ratcliffe a while ago and Ratcliffe is quite taken by him. Two years after the Ineos delegation visited Old Trafford, nobody has given a satisfactory explanation for Brailsford's presence on the United football board.",
      "Brailsford has admitted he is \"no expert in football\". You can see that from United's results since he started to have input on their performance. Brailsford was an ally of Ashworth's. United spent longer courting Ashworth than the five months he lasted at United.",
      "Ratcliffe should send Brailsford on his bike. That would show Ineos are serious about arresting United's staggering decline."

      "Before Wednesday's Europa League final, Manchester United would have had a Plan A and a Plan B for this summer. The binmen in Bilbao might find the more expressive shopping list discarded somewhere in the days to come.",
      "United have sought to downplay the impact the loss of that cash will have on their summer transfer plans, and they continue to press ahead with attempts to sign Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap. But for a club that has sacked 400 members of its workforce and made a series of penny-pinching measures, it's pretty obvious the financial effect of defeat to Tottenham will be seismic.",
      "But those two plans should cover departures as well as arrivals, and with no European football next season, Ineos can now take a bludgeon to this squad. United could have 31 first-team squad members when players return for pre-season and in a campaign that could be as short as 40 games, that is wildly excessive.",
      "A 25-man squad for next season would be fine, but only if that included some of the club's promising youngsters who are on the fringes of the first team. Any bigger, and there will be senior players barely getting a kick, and the dynamic at training will be difficult to manage for Ruben Amorim, who is desperate to make the most of those free weeks at Carrington.",
      "Some of the departures are straightforward. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are out of contract and will leave next month. Tyrell Malacia, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all out on loan and will be sold in the summer. That is seven players going already.",
      "Then are the potential sales. Change looks certain in the goalkeeping department, and Altay Bayindir should be sold for an upgrade to offer more competition to Andre Onana.",
      "The departures of Evans and Lindelof free up space in defence for Ayden Heaven, and no further sales are really required here, although the wing-back situation is one to monitor. Diogo Dalot needs competition on the right, and having Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass on the left looks light, but there might be no other option.",
      "Sales should be considered in midfield. The failure to qualify for the Champions League makes Casemiro's role redundant next season. He is a European specialist who has struggled in the Premier League, and Ineos desperately need shot of the club's highest earner. Manuel Ugarte doesn't look up to the job yet, but will get another season. Toby Collyer turns 22 in January and either needs more games or to be sold as well, as there are a crop of promising midfielders in the academy waiting for their chance.",
      "In attack, selling or at least loaning one of Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund looks essential. Neither are up to the job, but Zirkzee has probably shown more promise. He is less of a natural fit as a No. 9 for Amorim, but his versatility to play behind a striker is beneficial. If Amorim keeps Chido Obi in the first-team picture, he is another option at centre-forward.",
      "Then there are the two most controversial possible departures. Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho would have both been frustrated at their roles in the Europa League final and it's clear Amorim is yet to fully trust either. As academy graduates, they represent pure profit in the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) and are sellable assets.",
      "A departure for either would go down badly amongst supporters, but neither is in Amorim's strongest team, and it would be a major financial boost. Without the guarantee of what would have been at least 10 extra fixtures in the Champions League, keeping both of them happy might be a challenge as well.",
      "That is the context with which United must approach this summer. Defeat in Bilbao means they have to be ruthless when it comes to trimming the size of this squad."

      "The dust is beginning to settle on Manchester United's defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "United's season revolved around winning the Europa League for a few months and they stumbled to a 1-0 defeat at the Estadio de San Mames after a first-half goal from Brennan Johnson.",
      "The defeat means there will be no Champions League football at Old Trafford for a successive season. United have endured their worst campaign for 51 years, and Ruben Amorim has promised to quit without receiving any compensation if the United hierarchy feel he is no longer good enough to be their coach.",
      "However, Amorim is understood to still have the board's backing and he is set to remain in charge for next season, which means he must be supported in the summer transfer window.",
      "There are supporters who have questioned whether Amorim is the right coach to take the club forward, though, especially ahead of what will be a crucial transfer window.",
      "United cannot afford any mistakes in the transfer market this summer, but would persisting with Amorim be a mistake? Here are the arguments for and against sacking Amorim:",
      "Against: Amorim inherited the squad",
      "Can Amorim be judged fairly when he inherited a squad that was assembled by his predecessors? Erik ten Hag spent over £400million during his tenure and left behind practically nothing to show for it.",
      "United spent £108.5m on two strikers who struggle to score goals. Amorim has gone from working with Viktor Gyökeres, one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe, to coaching Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who have scored just 17 goals between them in all competitions this term.",
      "For comparison, Gyökeres has netted 53 goals for Sporting Lisbon this season and Amorim was dealt an impossible task when he agreed to take over a side with no natural goalscorer.",
      "The dressing room needs to be gutted. The majority of the players are not good enough to represent the club following an utterly joyless campaign.",
      "Of course, he needs to improve the players he inherited - that is part of his remit - but you can't make a concrete judgement on Amorim when he inherited a mess of a squad.",
      "For: the Premier League campaign",
      "There is no getting away from the disastrous Premier League campaign. United have been shocking and they will record their lowest points total in the Premier League era.",
      "Wherever you look, the league statistics make for grim reading. Amorim has won just 24 points in 26 games, averaging a 0.92 points per game. United last beat a team that wasn't relegated on January 26.",
      "Amorim's points ratio is even lower than Paul Jewell's 0.94-per-game average during Derby County's infamous 2007/08 campaign, when the Rams set the top-flight's lowest ever points total.",
      "Since Amorim's appointment in November, United have been beaten by Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost a record 18 games in the league and have a goal difference of -12.",
      "The team's focus shifted to the Europa League in February, but the lifeless performances in the league haven't been acceptable and Amorim must hit the ground running next season.",
      "Against: an impressive communicator",
      "Amorim has shown himself to be an impressive communicator in press conferences and interviews, which has helped his reputation among fans, who haven't turned against him.",
      "\"We'll back him from the Stretford End,\" has continued to be chanted to the tune of Bonnie Tyler's hit It's a Heartache despite the awful results, and the way Amorim has communicated has helped his cause.",
      "Amorim is convinced he knows what needs to be done to turn the club around and he is articulate when he speaks to journalists. More importantly, the players seem convinced in his plan, as Bruno Fernandes, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot all backed him after the Europa League final.",
      "Speaking in the mixed zone, Shaw said: \"I think there's a lot of things that need to be changed. I think that's why Ruben is 100% the right person.",
      "\"He knows and he can see day in and day out at the club, not just on the pitch but off the pitch, around the club. The standards, the mindset, like I said, I think he sees everything. I think he knows what he needs to change.\"",
      "Shaw will not decide Amorim's future, but those quotes were strongly in favour of the 40-year-old.",
      "For: formation concerns",
      "United are at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Champions League again. The financial picture at Old Trafford is pretty bleak and the kitty is close to running dry, if you believe Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "That's why this summer is so important. It could be a make-or-break window that decides the club's trajectory for the next five years and United must be sure they have the right coach.",
      "So is Amorim's formation the final 'game model' for Ineos' decision-makers? They must decide whether 3-4-2-1 will be the team's set-up over the next few years because that would ease concerns about backing a manager this summer who insists on playing said system.",
      "It would be a disaster to back Amorim and sign players for his formation this summer, only to sack him a few months into the season and appoint a manager who plays a different system.",
      "The academy teams currently don't play in Amorim's formation and United need to decide on their preferred style. Is this how they want United to play?",
      "Crystal Palace won the FA Cup and Inter Milan are in the Champions League final. They both play with a back-three and show the system can be successful with the right players.",
      "But there are concerns about whether United are settled on the formation and it would be a spectacular mistake to buy players who are tailor-made for Amorim and then to sack him.",
      "For: Europa League final defeat",
      "Considering United gambled everything on the Europa League final in Bilbao, a better performance was expected. United were awful against Tottenham and produced a shameful display.",
      "United struggled to lay a glove on one of the worst Tottenham sides in recent history, and they looked like the club that hadn't won a trophy since 2008. To lose a European final, against a club who are notorious for losing their bottle when it matters, in that manner was appalling and Amorim got a lot of decisions wrong.",
      "The starting XI was wrong, Amorim's tactics were wrong and his hesitation to make substitutions in the second half when the game was getting away from United didn't make sense.",
      "United did not go down fighting and never looked like equalising in the final minutes of the contest.",
      "Amorim's in-game management was lauded when he arrived from Sporting, but he failed to recognise his team selection was wrong and waited too long to introduce fresh legs.",
      "Against: lack of alternatives",
      "Earlier in the season, the thought process with Ten Hag was that he shouldn't be kept solely because there was a lack of alternatives. There was enough evidence to suggest Ten Hag needed to be sacked regardless, but Amorim's situation has not reached that stage.",
      "There is not an overwhelming body of evidence to overlook the lack of alternatives - the likes of Jose Mourinho, Kieran McKenna, Gareth Southgate, Xavi, Thomas Frank and Marco Silva - and sack Amorim.",
      "Could another coach have done a better job than Amorim this season? Probably, but that doesn't necessarily mean a change should be made this summer after just seven months.",
      "Against: trust in the academy",
      "Having a connection with the academy and trusting young players hardly matters when you're 16th in the Premier League, but Amorim does appear to understand the club's tradition.",
      "Although the promotion of some academy players to the first team has been enforced due to injuries, it has been encouraging to see Amorim give prospects the chance to be involved.",
      "It is obviously better to have a coach who is keen to give United's youngsters a chance."

United will be eyeing a major rebuild in the transfer window and which players stay, go or arrive will be interesting to see.",

      "Keep across all the United transfer updates and latest news in our dedicated blog below...",
      "Speaking on Catalan radio station RAC 1, as quoted by TEAMtalk, Barcelona sporting director Deco has confirmed that his club do have an interest in Rashford heading into the summer transfer window.",
      "The former Chelsea man explained:",
      "We like Luis [Diaz], we like Rashford, and we like other players. Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.",
      "According to ESPN, Amorim will demand that United look to bring in players that possess pace and strength in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed the Portuguese was fearful before the Europa League final that his team lacked these characteristics and this would ultimately cost them.",

      "Amid interest from the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes has admitted that United may try to cash in on him in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed that Al Hilal would be willing to pay £120m for his services and if such a bid was to come in, United may find it difficult to reject it.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the full-time whistle in Bilbao, Fernandes said:",
      "I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go. I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.",
      "United have been reassured that the deal to sign Cunha will not be cancelled despite missing out on Champions League football next season.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano told GiveMeSport that the deal to sign the Wolves man is still set to go through soon.",
      "United already told Matheus Cunha that they are prepared to trigger the clause, so there will be no issues. And so I think it's going to be the first signing of the summer for United. And it's important to say that the player wanted this move, regardless of Champions League football or not, regardless of what happens in the Europa League final. Cunha wants to play for Manchester United, and my understanding is that he will play for Manchester United.",
      "I fear with him that we will end up selling him for £50m-£60m for PSR reasons, possibly this summer - it has been rumoured hasn't it. I fear he might go somewhere else, he might play in a 4-3-3 and he will end up scoring 25 or 30 goals for somebody. That is how good I think this lad could be. Shoehorn him into this system and I think it might be an issue because I am not sure he can play wing-back. I am not sure he is clever enough to be in that No.10 role, I am struggling to find a position for him in this system.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Napoli are prepping a bid to sign Garnacho this summer having missed out on him in January.",
      "United rejected an offer in the region of £40m this winter but could be more open to selling at the end of the season with more time available to find a replacement.",
      "It is believed the Italians are preparing a £50m package for Garnacho and while United want £60m, the two teams are not too far away in their negotiations.",
      "Before the Europa League final, Garnacho shared an image of himself scoring in the last final he played in - the FA Cup against Manchester City.",
      "After the final whistle in Bilbao and with just 20 minutes to his name on Wednesday night, he struck back in his post-match interview.",
      "Obviously, it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.",

      "In his Caught Offside column, Romano wrote: \"There is genuine interest from two very important clubs – Chelsea and Manchester United. Both clubs have several targets on their shortlists between them, but for sure the interest in Delap is concrete and genuine. My understanding is that Delap has spoken to Chelsea and to Manchester United, and now it’s time for him to explore all the options possible.",

      "Professor Rob Wilson, Director of Executive Education at University Campus of Football Business, has outlined just how costly United's failure to get back into the Champions League will be. \"Having lost the Europa League, Manchester United have probably missed out on something between £10m to £15m in direct prize money,\" Wilson told Genting Casino.",
      "\"That was made up of around £4m for winning the final, somewhere between £3m and £5m from an increased UEFA coefficient share. Then there's elements around commercial bonuses, appearance fees, match day revenues that they would have benefited from. What we then need to remember of course is that there will also be an offset there.",
      "\"So they won't have bonus payments to pay, for instance, for their player wages. So that's quite an important factor to include. The qualification that they've missed out on in the Champions League has cost them around £85m of additional revenue. That revenue is due to broadcast, gate receipts and some of those UEFA payments.",
      "\"The fact that the club has missed out on that revenue is quite a blow to their budget line and will affect what they're able to do in the transfer market this summer, not just from an amount of cash perspective and what they can spend on transfers but also the type of players they can attract as a result of having no European football given their league position.\"",

      "This time last year Manchester United were gearing up for the start of the summer transfer window having identified just four players within their squad who were not for sale.",
      "This time around, you could not blame United's decision-makers for not putting a hands-off warning on a single member of Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Wednesday night's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao meant nothing is salvageable from what has been a wretched campaign. United will end the season without a trophy and potentially just once place above the relegation zone.",
      "As hard as the most upbeat United supporter might look for a positive, it will be an almost impossible task to pluck a single one out of this campaign.",
      "It is why there has never been a better time than this summer for the United hierarchy to gut this squad and be ruthless.",
      "Players such as Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Christian Eriksen need to be released, while the likes of Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Casemiro should all be sold. United plan to prioritise the sales of Rashford, Sancho and Antony.",
      "Successfully offloading those eight players would be a step in the right direction this summer. However, you could hardly file any of their departures under the definition of a ruthless decision.",
      "Instead, United need to make a statement by offloading one or more of their regular starters, such as Rasmus Hojlund or Alejandro Garnacho. Andre Onana is another who should not be safe from the axe.",
      "Despite plans for outgoings to reach double figures, United, following their failure to qualify for next season's Champions League campaign, are unlikely to have the financial clout to replace those who leave with an adequate level of quality.",
      "Failure to qualify for Europe's premier club competition could cost United somewhere around £85million, accounting for all of the broadcast money and sponsorship deals.",
      "United do not have a bottomless pit of money to turn to and they are not going to recoup the money they paid for almost all of the players they may end up moving on over the coming months.",
      "To add insult to injury, United owe £89m in transfer fees for players they have signed in previous windows, as confirmed by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this year.",
      "\"If you look at the players that we will buy this summer that we did not buy, in other words, we're paying for, that it is, we're buying Antony this summer,\" Ratcliffe told Gary Neville in an interview for Sky. \"We're buying Sancho this summer, we're buying Hojlund, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying Onana.",
      "\"It's not a light switch. In your day [Neville's], you bought a player and that was it. I know that the bill we will pay this summer is £89m for players that have been signed previously. If we buy no players, we write a cheque for £89m this summer.\"",
      "Going into this summer's window with the knowledge they must spend £89m in payments relating to previously completed transfers, United's chances of gutting their squad and making the wholesale changes they so desperately need to are slim.",
      "United are lining up three priority signings and are confident Wolves star Matheus Cunha will be one of them. His release clause will set them back £62.5m.",
      "On the face of it, United would be lucky to generate a combined sum close to that figure if they were to sell both Rashford and Antony, highlighting just how big a challenge they are set to face this summer. Qualifying for the Champions League would have boosted their kitty and given Amorim a much bigger budget to play with.",

      "While the rest of his Manchester United teammates were back in the dressing room at San Mames, Alejandro Garnacho lingered on the pitch, his peroxide blond hair making his presence distinctive. He still wore the Paul Smith club suit given to players for the occasion, and while the starting XI were getting their boots on, Garnacho was chatting to former United loanee Sergio Reguilon.",
      "By now, it had become clear that Garnacho wasn't starting, something first hinted at earlier in the afternoon when the 20-year-old did what 20-year-olds do, and hinted at his frustration on social media. The images of him scoring and celebrating at Wembley last season were a reminder and a rebuke to those who had now axed him for this final.",
      "Garnacho would eventually swap that suit for his kit, and his feet would get a chance to do the taking. He came on with 19 minutes to go and changed the dynamic, forcing Guglielmo Vicario into a sharp save and tormenting Pedro Porro. Several low balls in flashed across the box without a United shirt there to finish the move off.",
      "Then, less than half an hour after it began for Garnacho, it was over. He slumped to his haunches near the centre circle and looked crestfallen. Had he started the game, maybe it would have been different. You can certainly understand why he was annoyed.",
      "Amorim probably didn't help matters when he responded to questions about the winger by pointing out his bad miss in the first half of the second leg of the semi-final against Athletic Club.",
      "“Who missed the big opportunity in the first half in the semi-final? Garnacho. Football is like that,\" said Amorim.",
      "You could see the point he was trying to make, but it was made a little clumsily. Just down the corridor, Garnacho was preparing to deliver his own version of events. A usually reticent talker, he stopped in the mixed zone to speak to Spanish TV crews and delivered a brutal verdict on the season and his own role in the final.",
      "\"When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "Garnacho's brother, Roberto, had already taken to Instagram to vent his anger at the way he had been axed from the team for the final.",
      "“Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe hahahahahaha,” Roberto Garnacho wrote.",
      "This is the baggage that comes with Garnacho, who has already been dropped once by Amorim due to his attitude. The head coach praised the way the Argentine responded to his demotion from the squad to face Manchester City in December, but this could reopen wounds.",
      "The problem is, the bit Garnacho delivered in the middle on Wednesday night shows why he should remain a valuable member of the squad. He threatened to drag United back into the game and left the impression that they would have stood more of a chance had he started.",
      "No matter what happens against Aston Villa on Sunday, no United player will have played in more games than Garnacho this season, who made his 58th appearance of the campaign in the final. This isn't a fringe player we're talking about.",
      "But the feeling persists that he is an uneasy tactical fit for Amorim. Garnacho is desperate to play as a winger, but now has a head coach who doesn't use them. He hasn't been used as a wingback, and if he stays, his future will be as a No. 10 if the manager and player can find a balance to get the best out of him in that role.",
      "Garnacho could have left in January, with Chelsea and Napoli keen, and after Wednesday night United might well listen to offers again. His off-pitch antics won't have sat well with club officials, and the reality is that Garnacho is one of the most sellable and valuable assets in this squad, at a time when raising funds to reinvest is more vital than ever.",
      "The risks of selling are clear. Garnacho could easily leave and then thrive as a winger in Naples or elsewhere. If it doesn't work out for Amorim at Old Trafford and United go back to a head coach who wants wingers, then the sight of Garnacho excelling for another club will be another costly mistake.",
      "These are the pros and cons that they must weigh up this summer, and what happened in Bilbao on Wednesday has added to the ledger."

      "It’s unknown whether Amorim now regrets that decision nearly seven months on, having endured a torrid first season at Old Trafford. Under the Portuguese, United have consistently set new records for lows as the head coach struggles to impart his philosophy at the already-struggling club.",
      "United could finish this season in 17th place - one spot above relegation - in their worst Premier League campaign to date. And after losing the Europa League final in woeful fashion on Wednesday, Amorim has made it clear that he is open to leaving this summer if club bosses and fans decide he is the wrong man for the job."

After failing to secure Champions League football next season, the Reds are preparing for significant changes in the summer transfer window, and their captain could be among those departing.",
      "The Mirror reports United have made their entire squad available for transfer following their loss in Bilbao. This drastic transfer approach includes Fernandes and other key players such as Casemiro, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Andre Onana, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is prepared to take a ruthless approach to provide Ruben Amorim with a new squad for the 2025/26 season. United aim to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Liam Delap from Ipswich Town, but they reportedly only have about £100m to spend before considering sales.",
      "Fernandes' contract with United runs until June 2027, and the club also has the option to extend it for another year. However, following the defeat in Bilbao, the 30-year-old conceded that he would understand if United decided to sell him – a scenario that has now become a real possibility.",
      "Although this initial approach was rejected by Fernandes' representatives, Al-Hilal remain undeterred, it is claimed, and the midfielder's candid remark to media outlets in northern Spain will have given them reason to believe a deal could still be struck.",
      "When questioned about his future, Fernandes said: \"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this.",
      "\"I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days.",

      "Fernandes has been with United since joining from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020 for £68m, and, in that time, he has become a vital part of the team. In 289 appearances, he has contributed 98 goals and 86 assists.",
      "Following Erik ten Hag's appointment, Fernandes took over the role of captain from Harry Maguire. The Portuguese playmaker has been the standout player for United this season, contributing 19 goals and 19 assists in 56 appearances.",

      "The decision from Whiteside and his wife, Dee, not to renew their season tickets comes a year after they were forced to relocate their seats at Old Trafford to make way for executive seating.",
      "Writing on X, Dee Whiteside wrote: \"So, I’ve waited for a while to write this. It is with unbelievable sadness, that after more than 28 years of having season tickets at Old Trafford, @NormanWhiteside and I are not renewing next year.",
      "\"Having been forcibly relocated last season, “red carded” for not attending enough games, unable to give my “paid for” seat to my children… enough is enough.",

      "\"I’ll still be at games, I’m MUFC until I die, and I’ve seen worse times than now, but I’m not sure I’ve seen players less interested in pulling on our shirt for very many years. Times must change.\"",
      "Whiteside and his wife are platinum season ticket holders, which means they have held their tickets at Old Trafford for over 25 years, but they have felt compelled to walk away from United.",
      "A spokesperson for United said at the time: “We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations.",
      "\"There are various reasons why this happens, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders — in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.”",
      "Whiteside became the youngest player to score in both FA Cup and League Cup finals during his time in Manchester. The Northern Irishman also became the youngest to play in a World Cup, breaking Pele's record when representing his nation aged just 17 years and 40 days.",
      "Whiteside's career ended at the age of 26 due to injury, but he is still remembered fondly by fans for his contribution and his match-winning goal against Everton in the 1985 FA Cup final."

Amorim has said that he is still confident in his methods, but if the club and fans tell him to leave, he will do so quietly - and without adding to the significant bill United have racked up in compensation packages over the years.",
      "The final was billed as a £100 million pound game, given the amount of money Champions League qualification can bring in, and missing out will make the task of rebuilding the team that much harder.",
      "Speaking after the match, Amorim said: \"In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself, is not my style. I cannot do it, is really hard for me. So I have nothing to show to the fans to say I am going to improve because of this, I had these problems, I will not do nothing.",
      "\"In this moment, it’s a little bit of faith. So let’s see. Like I said before, coming here before in the flash, I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I’m not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation. But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",
      "Some fans are still eager to see what an Amorim team can do, given time and support. Reader StephenTaylor123 says: \"Listen, Ruben got it wrong last night, he shouldn't have started Mount over Garnacho and played Ugarte with Casemiro in the pivot. But in no way is Ruben Amorim the biggest problem at Manchester United.",
      "\"He needs to be given more players that will mould the team into the way he wants to play. The club is rotting due to complacency since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, and we seem to have a dressing room culture where players would rather soothe their own egos rather than play for fans and the badge, and that has to change.\"",
      "Commenter Steviweavi writes: \"100% he's the right guy! He's needs to be backed. There are a high number of this squad that need to be sold, though I doubt that could be achieved in one transfer window. A target of qualifying for Europa, along with more consistency would be a good enough target for next season. After another summer transfer window, we should be able to start challenging for top four and the PL the season after. Let's not run before we can walk.\"",
      "Red Devil 4 Ever says: \"Amorim has been honest in his assessment of performances and results. He's shown he's hurting, like us fans. Erik ten Hag in the same situation talked of being happy with the performances, of there being progress and the team are in transition. Amorim now knows the task better than anyone and what is needed to turn the team around.",
      "\"Offering to leave without a compensation package just shows the integrity of the man. Which of our previous managers made this offer? The club now needs to start recruiting players where we say 'WOW' and not WHO?\"",
      "Others have seen enough to want a fresh start, and to rebuild the team under new leadership without the pressure of European competition hanging over their heads. Reader Jungle Jerry writes: \"United should let Amorim go now while his offer still stands. He has said that he will leave without compensation.",
      "\"The club cannot afford to change the whole team. It is impossible to get rid of all the players and replace them in the next transfer window. The management cannot give Amorim the players he needs. Amorim will continue playing his way and United will be relegated next season.",
      "\"Best to let him go and get another manager or chief coach who is willing to do what is best for the club. Organise the players and play to their strengths. Come up with game plans and tactics that will win most games. That might keep the club in the top half by the end of next season.\"",
      "Utd4me adds: \"The football under Amorim is terrible to watch, the results are the worst they have been for many a year. The league position will be 1 above relegation. His tactic clearly doesn't work and he keeps saying that he will not change it. He has now offered to leave for free. Please tell me what he is showing or saying that warrants him keeping his job, because as it stands United would be better off getting in touch with Big Sam and readying him to take over next season.\"",
      "Garth123 says: \"The status quo next season may be not much different if the board sticks by Amorim, as we will have a good manager/coach but don't have the team he can utilise in his system.",
      "\"So reluctantly for me perhaps he needs to go, as the club will not be able to provide the players he needs for his system to be successful. The players we have currently can play 4-3-3 and this maybe the best way forward with another coach at the helm. Otherwise we could have another season like the current, with very little success.\"",

      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "Man Utd had their biggest game of the 2024/25 campaign on Wednesday night as the Europa League trophy, Champions League football and huge prize money were up for grabs as they faced Spurs in Bilbao.",

      "“I think Amorim has mentally checked out of the season after that game. I can’t imagine how they’re going to turn up against Aston Villa in their final game of the Premier League and I don’t think he’ll last next season.”",
      "O’Hara has also urged Amorim to “walk” because he is not the “right man for the job”.",
      "“The manager inept of ideas, didn’t know how to change it, didn’t know how to affect the game. Made substitutions too late.",
      "“He should walk because he ain’t the right man for the job. He’s really not the right man for the job. And the performances he’s put in since he’s gone there have been shocking.",
      "“He should walk but no one walks anymore because there’s too much money on offer. So he’s not going to walk.",
      "“Who’s going to join United? They’re 16th in the table. They’ve got no European football and everyone knows that the club is cost-cutting the wages. They’re getting rid of everyone.

      "Manchester United will always be the team which lost a European final to Spurs and that ‘stain’ is eternal. There is no ‘escape out of this doom spiral’.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "The INEOS brains trust can only be trusted with one more decision\nAs a United fan who didn’t even bother watching the Europa League final, I’m not the least bit surprised by the outcome. Manchester United are in complete shambles right now. The arrival of Ratcliffe has been so disastrous that even Ed Woodward starts to look like a footballing genius in comparison.",
      "United’s problems are numerous, but the most glaring issue is this: we can’t even decide what’s worse — the players or the managers. When it comes to both Erik ten Hag and Amorim, it’s safe to say that, as poor as the current squad is, the managers have been even worse. And therein lies the root of our troubles.",
      "We have no Director of Football. Our scouting network is non-existent or laughable at best. This leaves the manager (the one who can’t do their own jobs) to also do the scouting, resulting in hundreds of millions wasted on signings who have consistently failed to meet expectations. Under Ten Hag, huge sums were spent chasing his priority targets, yet almost every one of them has proven to be a disappointment. In contrast, Amorin is still demadning players for a system that has shown no evidence of working in the Premier League.",
      "The reality? United are expected to finish this season with 39 points — just above the relegation zone. In many other seasons, that would have meant relegation. Remember the outrage when United finished 7th under David Moyes, and that was without the financial backing ETH was given for instance.",
      "So what’s the solution?",
      "Unfortunately, the current management structure is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon. There will be no Director of Football appointment, no meaningful improvement to the scouting network, and no overhaul of the training facilities. The people in charge simply don’t seem capable of making the right decisions.",
      "This leaves us with only one viable option — one that comes with the caveat that it has not worked out too well in the past but is the only realistic path forward now. We need to hire an experienced, truly elite manager. Someone with a proven track record of winning titles and the full backing of the club. This manager should be entrusted with all football decisions — from which players to buy and sell, to upgrading facilities, restructuring the medical team, and establishing a reliable scouting and data analysis network.",
      "Most importantly, this manager must be given complete autonomy, no matter how much resistance or dissent there may be from players, he must be backed to the hilt season after season. Because the only thing the current board and management can be trusted with is one decision only, hiring the manager. And that too out of sheer necessity. Beyond that, let the only adult at the club (read: new manager hopefully) make all the decisions from thereon. Because, this United board and management have proven repeatedly that to allow them to make even a single more decision would be folly of the highest order.\nAdeel",
      "",
      "So, for the third season in a row, United found themselves in a cup final looking to salvage their season, only this time, they went to the well and they found there was nothing left for them.",
      "You can’t keep putting off the inevitable. This is a large scale rebuild. It will involve gradually shipping out 10 players and trying to bring in 10 who are an improvement on those going out. That’s a 3, 4, 5 year project. There is no quick fix. There are no shortcuts. The last two years have been sticking plasters, but you can’t keep putting plasters on open fractures. Sooner or later you have to accept that you require more advanced help.",
      "As I have said previously, the problem with United is that are yet to confront their reality. They may have the most Instagram followers in Kenya or whatever, but that is worth absolutely nothing on a football pitch. They need to accept where they are and what they are. Until they do, they will continue to go backwards.\nAndy H, Swansea.",

      "RIP Manchester United\nThe coroner pronounced Manchester United Football Club officially dead at 21:57 BST on the night of Wednesday 21st May 2025. It was 147 years old.",
      "Dramatic? Perhaps. But if the Europa League final really was “do or die”, well, United didn’t “do”. It feels like a death knell and I expect a lot of black worn at Old Trafford on Sunday for the blessed relief of the season finale. We didn’t deserve to win the Europa and certainly do not deserve Champions League football in 2025-26.",
      "You know things are bad when rival fans have (mostly) stopped laughing and are expressing sincere concern. I guarantee Spurs will be nowhere near the bottom 3 next season. I wish I could express the same confident claim about my own club, but I for one just cannot see an escape out of this doom spiral.",
      "Our best players are likely to be moved on (for tuppence ha’penny, natch); our once-coveted manager looks like he’s hating every single minute of his life and our tight-as-a-gnat’s arse part-owner is similarly regretting his life choices, whilst looking for all the world like a child’s doodle of a medieval king magically made flesh.",
      "The Championship is beckoning. Money can only insulate you from failure for so long in football. The last time we were relegated in 1974, it was only six years after becoming England’s first champions of Europe. With greater finances involved in modern football, it has insulated us for longer, but not for much longer, at this rate in any case. I will never stop loving my club and all its glorious (and inglorious) history, but I am really not looking forward to more of the same next season.",
      "A good start would be to stop losing to Spurs! Nothing against them, but four defeats to Tottenham in the same season? Four?! That’s insane. I’m pleased for big Ange, a man often luckless, scorned and derided. But to actually deliver on his pre-season pledge to “always” win a trophy in his second season? Gotta admire the man’s Tottenham Chutzpah. Just wish he didn’t have to do it at our expense!",

      "Manchester United (1878-2025) is over. I was thinking earlier this season, as a Liverpool fan, that if somehow they got relegated I would quit watching football or caring about the Premier League altogether (not the Champions League of course….) because it would be meaningless to entertain a rivalry when your biggest rival has been destroyed beyond repair. Of course, they didn’t get relegated -but gave it shot- yet United being United, they managed to produce an outcome just as humiliating and unbelievable; lose a European final to Tottenham. (To add insult to injury, without Maddison, Kulusevski, Bergvall…. basically, their best attacking options) 🤯",
      "Lost a European final to Tottenham… (try not to laugh reading that over and over again). They will have to live with that stain forever now. The last European trophy Spurs won was against Anderlecht, a club which fittingly has disappeared from the world stage. How do you live past that as a “proud football club” when Tottenham was the perennial butt of jokes for a reason?? Even hours before the match Paul Scholes was asked to revisit on TV the “lads, it’s Tottenham” pep talk Fergie gave them in the dressing room which became a meme, running joke, soundbite whatever to exemplify the complete helplessness and failure inherent to Tottenham. And yet, you’ve become their b****, Spurs beat them 4 times this season!!! 🤣",
      "In the end of the day, level at league titles and with twice as many European cups, the history books will tell the story that Liverpool beat Tottenham in a Champions League final but Manchester United lost to Spurs in a Europa League final. There are levels to this game. Liverpool has to find a new “biggest fixture” to look forward to because the English Derby no longer is. We may have to manufacture a rivalry with City going forward because United died this season. They’re just the gift that keeps on giving, having perfected the art of failure. You could not script a better season ending from a Liverpool fan’s standpoint.\nRaúl H. García (Number 7 next season and I’m done) LFC-YNWA 1892",
      "",
      "I was reading bits of the mailbox and Man Utd fans thinking out loud about how to forge a path ahead. Youth was mentioned an awful lot but here is the thing: if you were a talented player under 16 you would not sign for Man Utd right now.",
      "To protect kids and not disrupt families most clubs have to recruit within a geography but that means that Man Utd are competing with Man City and Liverpool for top youth players. Which team would you rather sign for if you were 12 years old right now?",
      "There’s no class of 92 that’s going to be emerging any time soon in my opinion. And the class of 92 had top professionals like Cantona to learn from; who would a kid in the youth team look up to right now other than Bruno?",
      "The club has cancer and it’s been allowed to persist so long that it’s infected almost everything. That combined with a disgruntled feeling from all the staff who Genius Jim has screwed to save £58 a week means that the morale couldn’t be lower.",
      "I don’t see Amorim as the answer and this £100m summer war Chest won’t go far when so much is about to be spent on Cunha making a step down.",
      "I’m obviously enjoying this malaise rather a lot. The summer of optimism will also be great before it comes crashing down on opening day when you lose at home to Fulham.\nMinty, LFC",
      "",
      "We do talk about Bruno\nI was really glad one of your 16 Conclusions on the final picked up on the double Bruno Fernandes turnover in the Spurs half prior to the goal. This gets glossed over so many times, especially when United play well or get a result. The amount of times he gives the ball away unnecessarily is astonishing.",
      "It got me to thinking after the game. If Fernandes were the talisman he is reputed to be. If he’s such a great goal scorer, creator, leader, why have none of the big clubs not come in for him? At the very least, why has there not been the odd rumour at the end of a non-disastrous season, linking him with Spain, Italy or Bayern?",
      "I think the answer to this is that they don’t want him. Is he a good player? Absolutely! But he’s not good enough to be constantly forgiven his wasteful passes, Hollywood balls, whining and moaning at the ref and team mates? I can’t understand how the 6 managers (interim included) he’s worked under since joining United have all deemed him undroppable. Not just that, he’s rarely subbed off",
      "United are in a very precarious position right now. There was talk earlier this season of a relegation battle. I shrugged that off, thinking there’s no way the quality of the teams at the bottom of the table would threaten a side of full internationals. But watching the game last night I could honestly say that I wouldn’t put a tenner on United to beat any of the 3 relegated sides if they were to meet in a week’s time with full strength sides. I don’t think the teams coming up this season from the Championship will be as bad as the 3 going down and I think Leeds and Burnley will have learned their lessons form previous bounces and prepare better for the upcoming top flight season.",
      "So if United want to keep doing the same thing, with the same players, then I genuinely feel next season could be worse than this. And if Bruno Fernandes is still the captain, playing 90 mins every week, no matter how bad his performances are, then they can have no complaints if next May they find themselves in must win matches to avoid dropping to the championship.",
      "I would like to clarify that I’m not laying all the blame for the current sh*t show at his feet. There are a number of players not fit to wear the shirt and the managers have to take a lot of blame too. But this is one area that seems to be constantly ignored and needs to be debated. Are United better off with Fernandes or without. Some fans might see Fernandes leaving as the last finger pulled from the dyke but I think his removal from the team would allow others to step up with an increased focus on in-game tactics. Just look what happened PSG when Mbappe left and the team became less of a one man show.\nMick, Newcastle",
      "",
      "Tinpot\nI’d like to address the concept that because of the finalists poor league performance and the poor quality game that the Europa League is now a tinpot trophy and shouldn’t get CL qualification.",
      "By this logic Wigan’s famous win, which wasn’t a great game, the same year they got relegated made the FA cup a championship level competition not worth European qualification.",
      "What about Denmark or Greece winning the Euros? Not the biggest teams nor the best football which would make that competition tinpot now as well.",

They should be able to celebrate without joyless chuds coming out the woodwork to say it means nothing.

      "It’s the final Premier League weekend of the season and that means it’s permutations time as the European places are settled, but to be honest we’re far more interested in joining the great big party that’ll be going off at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Liverpool v Crystal Palace\nLook, are there bigger and more important games on this weekend? Yes. Pretty much all of them in one way or another.",
      "But how often do any of us get the chance to watch a Premier League game that is less football match and more massive communal party? It will end with Liverpool receiving the Premier League trophy they won bloody ages ago now by beating a Tottenham team that – and this is impossible to imagine now – was in the grip of a banterously long trophy drought.",
      "But it isn’t just the home team having a big party here, with Crystal Palace also jubilant having sauntered past 50 Premier League points for the first time ever and also if less importantly won the FA Cup to nab their first ever piece of major silverware.",
      "Just a game where a lovely time can be had by all. Get Palace to bring the FA Cup with them. Delay the kick-off because everyone is just too busy giving each other guards of honour.",
      "The (very tenuously semi-) serious point here is that this should be one of the most happily cigars out and flip-flops on football matches ever staged and thus has rich potential to be one of those proper end-of-season games that ends 5-5 or some such silliness, where by the end the delirious fans of both teams are cheering every goal and wondering how on earth they’re going to make it to August with only transfer bumwash and the unwanted Club World Cup to sustain us.",
      "Other sadly untelevised but very live contenders for 5-5 style shenanigans on the final day include but are not limited to: Wolves v Brentford, Fulham v Man City and of course Tottenham v Brighton.",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Nottingham Forest\nBy far the most interesting of the Champions League chasers by simple virtue of novelty, while we also can’t deny we enjoy the fact that the Premier League could send interlopers off to the Big Cup for two years in a row, and those teams both in fact be former winners of said cup from before football was invented.",
      "Alas, a team that had everything safely in their own hands, spending much of the season in the top three, has wobbled sufficiently to leave their chances of a top-five finish now on the slender side.",
      "Even a month ago, Forest were sitting pretty in fourth, with a game in hand that could take them back above Man City and a three-point lead over Chelsea in sixth.",
      "Four games and five points later, they are on the outside looking in. The fact they face Chelsea on the final day is a half-full or half-empty situation depending on how you choose to view it.",
      "While they face undeniably the hardest task of the five teams scrapping for the remaining three places alongside Liverpool, Arsenal and – stop giggling – Tottenham in next season’s Champions League, they do at least know that a win for them automatically takes care of one of the two failures they need from a rival.",
      "If Forest take care of their own business they just need a stumble from Villa or Newcastle. And while Forest’s form has stalled – although it has by no means been a total collapse – they have had enough memorable days at the City Ground this season to believe they can deliver one last blow to the establishment, if only to save Nuno Espirito Santo from another confrontation with an angry iPhone 7-wielding owner.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Ruben Amorim\nOne of the great unique elements about the final day is the vast chasm in importance it can carry for two clubs in the same game.",
      "Sure, your Nottingham Forest v Chelseas are great, all-to-play-for head-to-heads that can determine the success or failure of entire seasons. And we’ve already dispensed with our usual miserabilism to look fondly at the great big party that’s about to go off at Anfield for Premier League winners Liverpool and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace.",
      "But perhaps the most fun final-day games are those between teams still fighting for a big prize and those who have just had their dreams crushed to dirt by the only club in the entire country that might be as ridiculous as they are.",
      "Step forward, Manchester United and their beleaguered life-choices-reconsidering manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The good news for Amorim and the lads is that they will almost certainly avoid the ignominy of finishing 17th even in the very likely event that they cannot rouse themselves from Wednesday night’s disappointment in Bilbao to stop an in-form, Champions League-chasing Aston Villa.",
      "But that’s only because Tottenham’s preparation for their own final game of the season against Brighton has been comprised entirely of memes, full-kit wankering, beer, cigars, parades and settling 17-year-old scores with Domino’s Pizza.",
      "While last-laugh-having Postecoglou faces the challenge of identifying his 11 least hungover players, Amorim and his team face an altogether different kind of headache.",
      "There is a grim fascination to be had in watching just what kind of performance Amorim and United are able to pluck from their arse against a very good side with no thoughts yet of the beach. We have a strong suspicion that the answer is ‘sh*tbone awful’ but, while nothing can be done now to save a season that saw all its remaining eggs trampled under Cristian Romero’s boots on Wednesday, a broken club in utter disarray could do with at least something to send them into the summer with some vague hope that things might be all right in the end.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Cole Palmer\nSympathy for Chelsea is not something generally in great supply, but there is some to be found for Enzo Maresca and his players as they attempt to manage their way through a frankly unprecedented set of circumstances.",
      "As almost everyone else’s season winds down, or in many cases has long since already wound down, the Blues face a decisive Champions League six-pointer at Forest on Sunday, then a European final three days later, and then after a moment to catch their breath head off to the States for the Club World Cup that absolutely everybody definitely wanted and needed and is in no way just a giant player-flogging FIFA cash cow.",
      "In circumstances like these, it is entirely unhelpful for your only real recognised number nine to bag himself a three-game suspension. Nicolas Jackson has done just that, though, and is still out for the vital trip to the City Ground.",
      "With Christopher Nkunku and Marc Guiu also out or at the very best extremely doubtful, the challenge of getting Chelsea over the line here before turning attention to the uncommonly large and important challenges that still await them in this never-ending season falls on the likes of Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho, back in contention here having been ineligible for the win over Manchester United.",
      "It really is a time when Chelsea could do with Palmer stepping up after a Difficult Second Season. Or Difficult Second Half Of Second Season, more fairly.",
      "Last month’s from-behind win at Fulham was, absurdly, Chelsea’s first and only Premier League away win since a 4-3 caper at Tottenham in early December. It’s a 10-game run in which Chelsea have scored only five goals and been shut out six times.",
      "Palmer himself hasn’t scored a Premier League goal away from home since opening the scoring in a 1-1 draw at Palace on the first weekend of January. That came near the end of a run of seven goals in nine Premier League games.",
      "His only goal since that run was a nerve-settling late penalty in the 3-1 win over a partying Liverpool.",
      "Sunday, at a team with the joint best home defensive record in the league, would be a fine time to step up. And unlike at almost every other club in the country, it’s even quite a useful time to get back into form for the further challenges that lie immediately ahead.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Sheffield United v Sunderland\nWe’ve already had a curious taste of a play-off final style game thanks to the unique circumstances that turned this year’s Europa League final into a Champions League play-off, with much attention given to the financial prize on offer and the chance for one of the two teams to spend next season being ritually humiliated at a higher level for which they are painfully ill-equipped and unprepared.",
      "So yeah, nothing at all like the Championship play-off final. Hopefully this will be at least a more watchable and entertaining game than we saw in Bilbao, and the Championship play-off final does traditionally deliver on that front.",
      "There’s no chance of a new club in the Premier League this time around with Sheffield United and Sunderland bidding to join other familiar faces from Leeds and Burnley.",
      "Sunderland would bring the greater novelty having not been seen in the top flight since 2017 and spending a good few years of the interim down in League One, but it’s Sheffield United – automatic promotion contenders for most of the season – who will start as favourites.",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Napoli v Cagliari\nWe generally try to avoid Friday night games but the Serie A title race is clearly the place to go this weekend and that means Friday night lights are our only option as Napoli and Inter scrap it out for the title.",
      "Both slipped up last weekend, leaving Napoli a point clear and with destiny still in their own hands as they seek a second title success in three years. Victory over Cagliari will do the job, delivering Antonio Conte a Serie A title with a third club after also tasting glory with Inter and Juventus.",
      "In a wildly out-of-character move, Conte has fallen out with the suits at Napoli which means this might be a brief yet glorious reign.",
      "Inter travel to Como at the same time on Friday hoping to do all they can to benefit from any further slip-up in Naples.",

      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",

      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",

      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",

Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",

      "Erik ten Hag has turned down the chance to return to Ajax, with the former Manchester United manager now edging closer to a sensational return to the dugout with 2023/24 Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Leverkusen have made “progress” in talks with Ten Hag, who has “given his total availability” following direct contact earlier this week. That shift in momentum comes as Ajax admit defeat in their bid to bring their former manager back to Amsterdam.",

      "Manchester United fans, with a view skewed by years of Sir Alex Ferguson-led glory, assumed many, many times in the dozen years since that the nadir had been reached. Nope. Come 6pm on Sunday while likely looking up from 17th in the Premier League, all that is left beneath is the Championship.",
      "Until now, the thought of Manchester United being relegated has been restricted to the wet dreams of ABUs. Logic says the club is simply too big to fail so spectacularly. But this is not the United of old. F*** knows what this United is.",
      "Now, barely a night’s sleep after losing the Europa League final, it is too much to explore in depth all the issues that make the Red Devils the undisputed banter champions of the world. Too much. Too sad.",
      "In short: United are a failed state. Once the richest of world superpowers, now unashamedly penny-pinching and staff-shedding in an attempt to live within its means, while those most culpable for their decline – players, executives, owners – trouser their grotesque salaries and dividends.",
      "The Glazers don’t give a f***. They milk their ailing cash cow from behind the safety of an INEOS-shaped shield, fronted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe carrying the look of billionaire regretting his life choices. At his stage of life, he doesn’t need this sh*t.",
      "And that’s precisely what the team have served up on a bi-weekly basis. At least, unlike Ratcliffe, the players and coaching staff are only tied to the boulder dragging them to the ocean floor for as long their contracts dictate. Or until someone, anyone, offers to pay actual money for them.",
      "There is perhaps one player, Bruno Fernandes, whose departure would be mourned by a majority of supporters. For many of his team-mates, there would be long queues of fans willing to piggy-back them to their next destination.",
      "It is too simple to say they don’t care. Most do, though predominantly with self-preservation in mind. Being a United player in recent years has been a cushy gig. Unlike other clubs, the personal rewards – the highest salaries and biggest profiles – were guaranteed regardless of the team’s fortunes. It is why Old Trafford remained an attractive destination, even while it was crumbling, literally and metaphorically.",
      "Not now. Would you advise any player to join this circus? Instinctively, the motives and sanity of anyone signing for United this summer will be questioned. Any top talent with a modicum of sense and palatable alternatives would drop their shoulder on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Poor Ruben. He did not want to join United mid-season and, in hindsight, he should have stuck to his guns. It highlights that as recently as six months ago, United still had something like the pull of old to make him doubt his instincts. Now, his first summer coincides with the first in generations when the club has so little to advertise.",
      "If Amorim was a pragmatist, he would consider resigning. He has offered to leave without compensation if the board and fans feel he should. Though he has failed to deliver anything like the improvement that was expected when he replaced Erik ten Hag, or even just a continuation of that dross, he probably still has an acceptable approval rating among fans. Barely.",
      "But if he looks at the task now before him, are his targets achievable? Just a fortnight ago, it was said that Amorim had been set the goal of a top-six finish next season. Would he honestly back himself to get what he admits is the ‘worst-ever Manchester United team’ up at least 11 places amid the chaos likely to ensue in the coming months?",
      "If so, crack on. If not, he’s still new enough in the job to deny ownership of the sh*tshow around him and leave with his reputation bruised rather than battered, beaten and left for dead in a gutter.",
      "If you ask supporters, most would probably prefer to avoid another managerial change. Who else is there? Amorim is a likeable fella and many fans appreciate his honesty even if outsiders don’t. But suspicion grows that he doesn’t help himself.",
      "He was appointed as one of Europe’s brightest young coaches with an admirable, steadfast belief in his principles and system. For as long as he’s in charge, United will be playing 3-4-2-f***ing-1.",
      "Which, of course, makes them hilariously easy to play against, especially while he has a squad wholly unsuited to it. It is lost on precisely nobody that a must-win final between two coaches who refuse to adapt was won by the one who eventually did.",
      "Amorim admitted in the wake of the Europa League final defeat that without tangible evidence of improvement, he is asking for ‘a little bit of faith’. Blind faith, that, when the manager has neither the means to play his way or the will to even consider the possibility of another.",
      "In the absence of anything else to cling to, Amorim will probably get what he’s asked for. Maybe he’ll repay that faith. But amid the post-Bilbao gloom, after a 21st defeat of the season, it is entirely conceivable that United have depths yet to plumb.",

      "Thing is, I don’t understand the double standards from the fans. When Ole was all about counter-attacking, he was lampooned (while doing better). When Ten Hag had to adapt to the players available in the meantime, he was derided for a lack of discernible style (while doing better). Amorim’s tactic is ALL about counter-attack at pace, yet we simply don’t see this in action at all. When we launched long balls to Fellaini, Weghorst and Scotty, the manager was mocked. But it’s ok for Amorim to do it less effectively with Maguire?",
      "As many others have said, while painful, this is arguably a preferable result. It’s not like we were going to be allowed to celebrate it anyway. The club needs a reset with a number of high-profile players being sold or just plain culled. It needs to go back to being built around youth. We need that youthful running and fearlessness, we need that hunger, we need players who are about the team not themselves, we need players from the academy and area. And as a result of this “performance”, we now can’t realistically afford to keep these big-wage players. It’s time to act like we were actually relegated, clear the deadwood, and rebuild properly, whether we keep Amorim or not.",
      "Critically, the club needs to be shot of players who regularly get exposed in the biggest games. Obviously, I’m thinking Maguire in particular there who once again exposed, Shaw (powers definitely now very waned) as he has done on repeat down the years. I’m also thinking one-trick Bruno who once again couldn’t pass in between the cracks and just pinged balls out wide. I’ll say it again: Bruno has personally *missed* as many big chances as he has created. Too often, he was more interested in moaning at his team-mates than being available for the pass.",
      "Back to the main villain here though, forget the refusal to make substitutions in a timely manner – poor Amad was run out by the 60th minute, having been kicked all game – the introduction of Mainoo with 2 minutes of regular time left was a f***ing insult. This guy has the perfect skill set for exactly this kind of game where space is tight, but no… seems Ineos want to get him to accept being sold, so puppy dog Amorim won’t play him.",

ETH got rid of loads and only brought in a small number of bodies – at great expense – almost all of whom haven’t worked out. Manchester United went into a major European final with 1 single striker, who is an unproven kid completely out of form. No options on the bench. No Ole on to win it. Nothing. Maguire up front.",

This season it really isn’t like that, with so much quality across 15 odd places. And you know what? Most of the teams haven’t been built by ridiculous overspending.",

      "As a United fan I am deeply worried. Not because we lost in a final to the 17th best team in England but because if you haven’t notice United can’t actually beat any of the top 16 teams in England not called Manchester United. Not only that but we have a team that is seemingly full of players – with few exceptions – that are physically incapable of performing in their designated league.",
      "United play at half pace compared to the good English teams (including Spurs). I am worried this is down to both the manager AND the players. If it’s one or the other I can work with it and have some patience but I think it might be both. This would mean yet another full reset is needed.

      "If we err on the side of optimism and say Amorim is just hampered by his players (we are at least starting to dominate possession even if we aren’t doing anything with it) then let’s look at the squad (again, because everyone wants another United deep dive).",
      "Onana – not good enough. In his prime.\nBayindir – not good enough. In his prime.\nHeaton – old",
      "Dorgu – has the physicality and possibly some skill but is still inexperienced\nShaw – fragile, cannot be trusted to play every week, hasn’t performed consistently for United in two years. Also turns 30 in July.\nDalot – availability is his biggest asset. Not great going forward. In his prime\nMazraoui – has been surprisingly available, good defender, not great going forward. In his prime\nMaguire – old, plodding, not reliable in any sense, annoyingly stupid occasionally and prone to mistakes. Good for ten minutes in each game as a centre forward though\nYoro – inexperienced but definitely going to be a great player if he avoids injuries\nDe Ligt – a younger Maguire. In his prime.\nMartinez – injury prone, short. But a fan favourite and we love him. In his prime.\nLindelof – old and never good enough (wasted a minute for spurs by complaining about time added on\nHeaven – young but looks like he has potential and physicality\nAmass – looks a baller but he’s tiny! Young and inexperienced\nFredricson – has done ok when he’s played. Young and inexperienced\nMalacia – probably not good enough but also lacking physicality, especially after his injury. Hasn’t played the full 90 mins on loan for PSV since March. In his prime.\nJonny Evans – too old and injured",
      "Bruno – heart and would of the team. Brilliant but frustrating. Getting on a bit.\nUgarte – should be approaching his prime but can’t get in the side against Spurs in a European final. Does he lack the pace and passing ability for the Premier League?\nEriksen – slow, old, past it\nCasemiro – see Eriksen\nMainoo – huge potential but easy to get past. Lack of physicality.\nToby Collyer – looks ok when fit. Tenacious if limited passing ability (from what we’ve seen).\nDan Gore – tiny but tenacious. Young and massively inexperienced\nMount – theoretically a proper Premier League player in his prime. Practically an unknown entity due to injuries.",
      "Hojlund – still young, lacking confidence. Probably also lacking skill, strength and intelligence. Has the size and speed (and possibly the ability) to trouble defences acrosss the world but hasn’t figured out how to use it. Quite possibly never will under the spotlight at United.\nMarcus Rashford – skillful, fast, strong when he wants to be, in his prime. Performs only in fits and starts and doesn’t want to be at United (don’t necessarily blame him for the latter). Still only 27.\nZirkzee – seems quite decent. Has the physicality and the skill to play in the Oremier league, not necessarily the speed. Can. Not. Shoot. Still young(ish)\nAmad – young, skillful, great at pressing but lacks physicality when on the ball and entering the box. Has scored seven league goals this year but three were against Southampton.\nGarnacho – Still young. Much like Amad seems a little lightweight but doesnt necessarily work as hard. Slight better quality with his shooting though. Exciting player to watch.\nAntony – should be in his prime. Rubbish for United after an ok first season. Lighting up the Conference League for Betis. Not a Premier League quality forward though could be repurposed as a wing back?\nEthan Wheatley – Young, massively inexperienced. No idea if he has the talent required at the top level.\nChido Obi – lots of hype. Tall but needs to fill out. Only 17. Could be a good player, could disappear.\nSancho – should be in his prime. Not apparently quick enough or physical enough for the Premier League. Seems to have some other baggage.",
      "Right so from that list of 34 players we have 14 players that are still young and unproven in the Premier League. 7 players are passsed it (or never were it), including Luke Shaw who has been a walking injury for far too long. That leaves 13 who are in their prime (or should be) but that includes two goalkeepers who are definitely not performing at the required level, at least three players who have big question marks over their injury records and at least three who are currently plying their trade elsewhere because they want to leave the club. Malacia is a combination of all three (except the goalkeeper part). This leaves us with four competent outfield players in their prime who have no question marks over their quality* or availability: Dalot, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte. And the jury is probably out on Ugarte.",
      "I wouldn’t be totally upset if United shed 13 players this summer. But if we shed the ones I’m thinking about, we’d be down to a squad of 21, 14 of which would fit in that young and inexperienced bracket. I think this is potentially disastrous. Not for the first time in its history United are over reliant on young players to perform. Whilst there is bags of potential there, the Premier League is less forgiving than at any time in the past and most of those players are lacking the physicality or composure to thrive in it.",
      "Equally, United are now incentivised to sell the best of those players before selling the 13 I mentioned. In doing so, the soul of the club will be damaged as a result, even if you don’t think Garnacho or Mainoo are good enough.",
      "All this is to say that United are now more than open heart surgery away from competing in the Premier League. Fans will be expecting a bounce back into Europe next year. Some will even fancy a Champions League spot or a title push. The reality is that the first goal – for the first time in the Premier League era – will be to get to 40 points. Based on the current squad, anything else will be a bonus.",
      "Perhaps we’ll be able to say a lot of those young players have come of age next year and everyone will stop being injured and we’re no longer looking at a squad containing 4 players in their prime. If we do so then we’ve had a better season than this one by a long stretch. But then we could also be relegated for the first time in 50+ years.\nAshmundo (quietly pleased for Ange, mate)",
      "*in terms of being good enough to play in the league, not win it. By the latter measure we are very fucked indeed.",
      "It’s who real fans are, mate\nLast night the football wasn’t great, but as the fans of either team could tell you, on such an occasion the only thing that matters is the result. Shortly after the final whistle two of my three sons drove down to Tottenham just to be part of the celebration. Since I started taking the boys to Spurs in the early nineties, the celebrations have been fairly thin.",

Many of whom who are probably like my lads school friends, die hard fans of clubs in cities they haven’t even visited. Just let the fans of either team celebrate/vent as appropriate. Let people enjoy the moment, not everything has to be a d*ck measuring contest. There is a shortage of joy in the world, so just back off and let fans enjoy themselves.",
      "So far this year I have been genuinely happy for Newcastle and Palace, whilst I know a couple of Geordies I know no Palace fans at all, but could appreciate the joy of both sets of fans at winning, after some lean years.",
      "I will join my lads to see the parade on Friday, and be back in my usual seat on Sunday. As grumpily as ever I will fork out the cost of my season ticket renewal at the latest possible moment.",

In amongst all the garbage mentioned above, there was a brief note from Garey Vance MUFC. Despite my not having written to this site in quite a long time, he name checked me, telling me to enjoy the celebrations.",

      "It was also fantastic to see their fans and players celebrating and enjoying it so much. I watched the game with a lifelong Spurs fan, and there was a small group of other Spurs fans in the United dominated pub. It was great to see how delighted they were. Modern football has increasingly found a smaller and smaller pool of teams hoovering up all the pots. This season has been different and all the better for it. Palace winning the FA cup, Spurs winning last night. Even as a Liverpool fan I was able to enjoy the celebrations as Newcastle broke their trophy curse.",

At which point my 11 meg of broadband couldn’t take it anymore and snapped for an hour. I don’t expect I missed anything.",

I watch football every day of every week and it was even too much for me and too low in quality.",

      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" said the 40-year-old.",

      "When a player breaks the record for goal involvements in a 38-game Premier League season and fires his team to the title, it makes this category pretty routine. Step forward, Mo Salah.",
      "The Liverpool star has taken his game to new levels at the age of 32, posting career-best figures for assists to go with his huge haul of goals. Yes, Virgil van Dijk has been imperious at the back, yes, Alexander Isak and Declan Rice have shone for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively.",
      "But Salah has been involved in over 54 per cent of Liverpool's goals. Simply, they wouldn't have won the title without him.Peter Smith",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo needs an honourable mention here. Nottingham Forest were tipped by some for relegation, but he has led them to the European places. If the season ends in Champions League qualification, it would have been an incredible campaign for the Nottingham Forest boss.",
      "Eddie Howe is also a worthy candidate after leading Newcastle United to Carabao Cup glory and potentially the Champions League, but it's hard to look past Arne Slot.",
      "Many thought there'd be a drop off from Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp's exit, but testament to the job Slot has done at Anfield, there hasn't been.",
      "His first season in English football has ended in the title, which is an incredible achievement.Oliver Yew",
      "Nikola Milenkovic has had an incredible debut season for Forest. The £12m summer signing has been instrumental under Nuno and fans have marvelled at the brilliant partnership he's forged with fellow centre-back Murillo.",
      "Milenkovic ranks inside the top five for duel success both on the ground and in the air, mixing with likes of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate.",
      "The 27-year-old Serbia international has also bagged four goals for Forest this season, just pipping Dean Huijsen who shone in his brief but fantastic spell at Bournemouth.Emilie Mwanza",
      "It became pretty obvious after Myles Lewis-Skelly's full Arsenal debut that he would go on to become something big.",
      "The teenage left-back's first Gunners start came in December but there was just something about him - his football arrogance, his ability to take the ball under pressure without fear or error and his consistency.",
      "Since then, he has become first-choice in that role and with England's left-back role at his feet too - a meteoric and unchallenged rise.",
      "And there is more to come - expect Lewis-Skelly to transition into midfield in the coming years.Sam Blitz",
      "Last season's top two, Man City and Arsenal, served up a pair of contrasting classics, starting with a bad-tempered, but intriguing four-goal classic at the Etihad in September that appeared to be going the visitors' way - that is, until John Stones's scrambled 98th-minute equaliser sent the home fans crazy, while breaking Gunners' hearts after almost holding on for the win since half-time with just 10 players.",
      "The return meeting at the Emirates in February may have lacked that tension, but the quality of Arsenal's five-star display that ripped the champions apart more than made up for it, with young left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly showing just why we selected him as our Young Player of the Year.",
      "However, our game of the season features the champions, although it is not their drama-filled 2-2 draw in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in February when James Tarkowski thundered home a 98th-minute equaliser that made the famous old ground shake.",
      "Rather it is Liverpool's visit to Newcastle United in early December that was this campaign's standout match and not just because it finished 3-3! The clash in the north east had all the ingredients that make up a classic, being played under the St James' Park lights, producing an electric atmosphere as a result, and plenty of goals, including a contender for strike of the season from Magpies forward Alexander Isak and then late drama when the hosts levelled matters.",
      "All in all, a real feast of football to showcase the brilliance of the Premier League.Rich Morgan",
      "\"The touch is as good as anything we will see in the Premier League this season. It's Messi-like.\"",
      "The touch to bring Bart Verbruggen's long punt downfield is sublime, the turn and change of direction to create space for the shot is sensational, and the whipped finish into the bottom corner rounded off a special Premier League moment.Oliver Yew",
      "Matz Sels and David Raya have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League goalkeeper this season, so it should be of no surprise to see their names featuring heavily in this category.",
      "In fact, Sels' player-of-the-match performance to prevent Liverpool from taking all three points at Nottingham Forest in January features several world-class stops that all came under consideration.",
      "There were several other saves that caught the eye during the season, such as Emi Martinez displaying ridiculous reactions to prevent Chris Wood's header from crossing the line at the City Ground in December, Andre Onana diving full length to deny Crystal Palace's Ismaila Sarr and Alphonse Areola somehow keeping out Mohamed Salah's close-range strike at the London Stadium before Christmas.",
      "However, the nod goes to the aforementioned Raya, who helped Arsenal inflict on Aston Villa their only home loss in the league this season with a simply ridiculous second-half stop to keep out Ollie Watkins' header.",
      "The Arsenal No 1 first had to touch Amadou Onana's deflected shot on to the bar, before immediately springing back up to his feet and pushing away to safety the England striker's point-blank header, with Gary Neville exclaiming on commentary: \"How Raya reacts, wow!\"Rich Morgan",
      "A moment that will live forever in history. James Tarkowski crashing in a 98th-minute equaliser in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Forty-one wins apiece for Everton and Liverpool at the Grand Old Lady. Forever. Hit play on our video above and drink in those extraordinary scenes again...Peter Smith",
      "Too many to choose from. The Man Utd head coach has been relegation-level on the pitch, but Quadruple-winning in the press conference room.",
      "\"We're maybe the worst team in the history of Man Utd,\" wins it though. That came in January after a loss to Brighton. Nobody actually expected him to follow through with it though…Sam Blitz",
      "A season of profit has been secured for the fifth season running with the best bets advised in the column leading to +18.7. It's been a bumpy ride involving near misses and losing runs but the winners have flowed nicely. A spell of betting against Manchester City at short prices before it was trendy to do so made me look very clever indeed, correctly calling wins for Tottenham (0-4), Bournemouth (2-1) and Brighton (2-1) during City's mid-season wobble was a memorable spell.",
      "There have been longshot treble wins at 10/1 and 14/1 - a particular highlight was Joelinton's card for Newcastle at Aston Villa copping the treble after Brentford beat Brighton and Palace and Bournemouth sailed under the 2.5 goals line in a 0-0 draw.",
      "And we've finished the season strongly, nailing a lovely 10/1 winning angle on 32+ fouls being committed in the Europa League final.Lewis Jones",
      "Learning to accept being wrong is a key part of keeping a sane headspace when it comes to making betting decisions and putting your neck on the line. And I've had plenty of practice this season.",
      "Let's start with Tottenham to finish in the top four and Dominic Solanke to score 20 or more goals shall we at 12/1? Or what about Leif Davis - the Ipswich assist-king of a full back - who I was excited about in the top assist markets in pre-season at 100/1? Just one assist was it Leif? Ah well.",
      "In fact, my reading for most of the season on the newly-promoted teams was downright ugly. Thinking Leicester were a \"barnstorming price\" to beat Everton at Goodison Park at 7/2 quickly went down the drain after just 10 seconds when Abdoulaye Doucoure sent the hosts on their way to the most comfortable 4-0 win you're ever likely to see.Lewis Jones"

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 06:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."

      "Got away with it, then became a hero. An early stumble but Rasmus Hojlund could not take advantage, and he then gifted a chance to the same United striker, only to be saved by Micky van de Ven's acrobatic heroics. Produced two good saves to deny Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw late on to redeem himself. At least one goalkeeper turned up…",
      "Two excellent halves for different reasons. The first half saw him use his wand of a right boot to create some good openings, then he had to be defensively secure in the second period.",
      "He's never lost a final and you can see why. The Argentina defender showed excellent awareness throughout as he marshalled his side's low block brilliantly, making more clearances than any other Spurs player. He even got into Harry Maguire's head when the United centre-back started to threaten in the box. Spurs have to keep him to develop - but will he stay?",

      "Looked nervous early on, swiping at a Man Utd corner and getting turned by Amad Diallo too many times. But he then grew into it and shut down the United winger in the second half. His game was summed up by a great tackle in the box to deny Amad a decent opening, before breaking to set up Dominic Solanke's big chance for 2-0. He did so much running, it is no wonder he had to come off late on.",
      "Solid. Won the second-most duels out of any Spurs player on the pitch - behind Romero - and the second-most tackles behind Udogie. Will be one of the more underrated players from this success.",

      "Caused all sorts of problems early doors for Luke Shaw and you could see his opener coming. That trademark run from back post to front under Ange Postecoglou's tactics is destined in Spurs' folklore for generations. Did his work in the other direction too.",
      "You felt for the Spurs forward - he did so much running off the ball without getting many touches. Should have done better with a chance on the break for 2-0 but set up a decent chance on the break for Heung-Min Son at the same time. An important moment.",
      "A shock inclusion over captain Son - but you can see why he got the call up. Less of an attacking presence and did not do much in the air against Noussair Mazraoui, but his defensive performance and selfless display was excellent. He was taken off with an injury, which showed how much he committed.",

      "Brought on to shore up the backline as another centre-back and helped with the low block, including one huge clearance from an Amad cross. Had half a chance from a free-kick but did not take it.",
      "Nervy, shaky, unconvincing in his decision-making. Onana's frequent reluctance to come out and claim crosses or back passes created nervousness in defence for United - and gave Spurs an invitation to cross. He was not totally at fault for Spurs' opener but the indecision took its toll. More cons than pros this season by quite a way - time for United to move on?",
      "Not great but not bad. Nearly caught out by the Spurs press in the first half but not helped out by more Onana indecision. He could have scored in the second half but it is harsh to criticise the second-youngest player to feature in a European final for Man Utd.",
      "The centre-back was player of the half for United in the first period - until the opener. Solid in defence, put his body on the line and caused issues in the other penalty box. But he then fell asleep towards the end of the half, letting too many balls bounce, including for Spurs' opener. He was rattled by Romero - no goalscoring heroics this time.",
      "Beaten easily by Johnson a couple of times early on so it was no real surprise to see him overcome by the same player for the goal. Not good enough with the ball either going forwards. A sharper Shaw may have fared better but United miss Lisandro Martinez in that position.",
      "Like Yoro, he cannot be blamed too much. Good in the air against Richarlison, including a good, well-timed header to deny the Brazilian early on at the back post. He won 12 duels overall and got forward well, setting up that glorious Bruno Fernandes chance. Harshly taken off but can understand the need to bring attack-minded Diogo Dalot on.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder had some flashpoints with some big tackles, which showed he could still deliver in a big game, but that is where his influence was limited to. You cannot help but think how he has gone from Champions League finals with Real Madrid to this.",
      "Anonymous throughout as the Man Utd captain struggled against Spurs' flat midfield three. His frustration was summed up by lashing out at Udogie to concede a free-kick and having a simple pass cut out by Johnson, which led to a Spurs counter attack. He then missed that big chance to level. It was just not a captain's performance.",
      "Not bad going forwards and got into good areas, but spent a lot of time tracking back to help Shaw out. The youngster did not communicate enough for Johnson's goal - he wil learn.",
      "United's bright spark. The young wide man caused Udogie a lot of problems and provided United's only two shots in the first half, plus the cross for Hojlund's decent chance just after the break. A light in a dismal Ruben Amorim era.",
      "From light to dark. Mount was given a chance and did not take it. Mount actually got in the way of his United team-mates a couple of times in the first half, while he lacked the final ball throughout. Rightly taken off as United's need for a goal became more urgent - and Alejandro Garnacho did more in four minutes than Mount did in 70. Matheus Cunha will take his slot next season, no doubt.",
      "The young forward's hold-up play was actually not bad. But United lacked a penalty box presence needed from a striker in a cup final. Needed to take that second-half chance from Amad's cross and unlucky to be denied by Van de Ven's stunning clearance. But Man Utd need better. Ten Premier League games without a shot, as well.",
      "Brought on for Hojlund and got as many yellow cards as he had shots. Just six touches of the ball in around 20 minutes. He's just not a striker, is he? But if Fernandes, Cunha and Amad are the No 10 options then where does it leave the Dutchman?",
      "Probably should have started given Mount's performance and kept out by Vicario well. But if he and Kobbie Mainoo are not trusted for a European final, where does it leave them in Ruben Amorim's plans, especially as they are both available to be sold for pure profit?"
