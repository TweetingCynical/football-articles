      "Manchester United and Chelsea have been exploring a swap deal which would see Raheem Sterling trade Stamford Bridge for Old Trafford after losing his starting spot",
      "Dan Ashworth has been working on a deal which would see Manchester United bring Raheem Sterling to Old Trafford without paying an initial outlay, it has been claimed",
      "Ashworth, who took over as United's sporting director this summer, has already overseen several new signings. Manuel Ugarte is set to become the fifth senior player to join during the current transfer window once his move from Paris Saint-Germain is made official for an initial £42m.",
      "Sterling could become number six, with talks opened over a potential swap deal. Jadon Sancho could move to Chelsea as part of an agreement, in a move which would allow both clubs to dispense with out-of-favour wingers.",
      "With United already spending big on their new signings, though, Ashworth has recognised the need to be smart when it comes to any remaining deal. With Chelsea already making it clear Sterling would struggle for game time in West London, the ball appears to be in their rivals' court.",
      "According to The Telegraph, United are determined to pay no outlay for Sterling. The aim comes against the backdrop of the expectation that Chelsea would cover the bulk of Sterling's wages to allow him to leave Stamford Bridge.",
      "Sterling still has three years left on his £300,000-per-week deal in West London. Sancho, meanwhile, has two years remaining on the deal he signed when he joined United in 2021.",
      "Sancho returned to Dortmund on loan for the second half of last season, helping the team reach the Champions League final. A permanent switch didn't follow, though he made his first United appearance in close to a year during pre-season.",
      "Sterling, with 123 Premier League goals, is the third-highest scoring player still active in the competition. Only Jamie Vardy (137) and Mohamed Salah (159) have more than the England international, though he has only scored 14 league goals in his two Chelsea seasons.",
      "After featuring in pre-season for the Blues, Sterling was left out of the matchday squad for the Premier League opener against his former club Manchester City. Speaking after the game, manager Enzo Maresca lifted the lid on the situation affecting the out-of-favour stars in the Blues' bloated squad.",
      "“I'm not saying Raheem is not a good player but I prefer different kinds of wingers.This is the reason why,\" Maresca said. “I spoke with Raheem, one-on-one the day before City and I explained him exactly the situation. I didn't see Raheem after the game.",
      "“In this moment, they (Sterling and Ben Chilwell) are training apart. The situation with them both is quite clear. There is not any update on their situations. In case I sit with Raheem, I will tell him exactly the same things that I already told him. I don’t have anything new to tell him because I was quite clear.”",

      "Manchester United have had countless big names come and go in the transfer market, but three in particular were deemed to be a negative influence in the dressing room not too long ago",
      "Manchester United have seen a host of big players come and go in recent times.",
      "But there's three players the club were reportedly eager to get rid of due to having a \"bad influence\" on the dressing room. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were mainstays in the United side for several years, while Edinson Cavani also excited fans when he arrived from Paris Saint-Germain, yet all three were shown the exit door at United after turmoil behind the scenes.",
      "It was previously reported how former interim manager Ralf Rangnick was looking to get shut of the trio due to them possessing a disruptive influence. They were also allegedly 'killing the mood' in the United camp.",
      "So, what became of the players that Ragnick and his successor Erik ten Hag seemed eager to move on. Mirror Football takes a look.",
      "Cavani became a hit with the United faithful after he netted 17 times in his debut season at Old Trafford. However, a dismal second season saw the player not only give his number 7 shirt up to Cristiano Ronaldo but only play 15 games due to injury.",
      "Things took a turn for the worse when on several occasions, it was deemed that Cavani effectively ruled himself out of games through injury, leaving United legend Paul Scholes to even brand him a “disgrace”. Rangnick grew impatient with the player and, along with Pogba and Martial, accused the 37-year-old of destabilising the atmosphere at United, according to German outlet Bild.",
      "In May 2022, Rangnick bid goodbye to Cavani in a United shirt, with the player then signing for Valencia. The Uruguayan star lasted a season back in Spain before he joined Boca Juniors in Argentina.",
      "Upon leaving, Cavani thanked United supporters but claimed that he \"wanted to contribute more this season\", referring to his second underwhelming campaign for the Red Devils.",
      "Pogba, who had two stints at United, left to rejoin Juventus in the summer of 2022 after a difficult spell back at Old Trafford.",
      "Jose Mourinho re-signed Pogba for United in a deal worth nearly £90m, with the star's mega-money move preceding what was meant to be a new fruitful period for the club post-Sir Alex Ferguson. What followed, however, was six years of managerial fallouts, disputes with team-mates and moments of tension with United fans.",
      "Nevertheless, his fractured time at the club was punctuated with fleeting moments of brilliance. Pogba then returned to Juventus on a four-year deal after Ten Hag deemed him surplus to requirements. However, his time in Italy was beset with injury.",
      "His career then took a turn for the worse as he was banned from football for four years. The midfielder tested positive for DHEA, a banned substance that boosts endogenous testosterone. Pogba and his camp have always maintained innocence and that the taking of any prohibited substance was never intentional.",
      "In a statement he said: “I have today been informed of the Tribunale Nazionale Antidoping's decision and believe that the verdict is incorrect.",
      "\"I am sad, shocked and heartbroken that everything I have built in my professional playing career has been taken away from me. When I am free of legal restrictions the full story will become clear, but I have never knowingly or deliberately taken any supplements that violate anti-doping regulations.\"",
      "Martial joined United from Monaco in 2015 and endeared himself to the United crowd when he scored a sensational goal on his debut against Liverpool in a thrilling 3-1 victory. The Frenchman spent several years at United where he scored 90 goals in over 317 appearances.",
      "He remained a key player for his first few seasons at United, with his 23 goals in the 2019/20 campaign a career-best. However, dips in form and injuries plagued his final few years at Old Trafford.",
      "His time at United was largely drama free - until he clashed with Rangnick. After being accused by the German of refusing to play, Martial hit back on Instagram.",
      "\"I will never refuse to play a match for Man United,\" he said. \"I've been here for seven years and I never disrespected and never will disrespect the club and the fans.\"",
      "The player joined Spanish side Sevilla on-loan for the second-half of the 2021/22 campaign, and upon his return, he never became a permanent figure in the side under Ten Hag.",
      "He is now a free agent as he weighs up his next move, with Sky Sports reporting that a return to his homeland appears to be the most likely destination. Ligue 1 rivals Lyon and Marseille, who snapped up Mason Greenwood just a few weeks ago, are both interested in landing in the 28-year-old.",

      "It is understood that Ajax forward Brobbey is one of a number of forwards they are looking at this week as they ponder a late move.",
      "Brobbey, 22, could be on the market for around £25m. Ajax are looking to strengthen their squad before the deadline and the Dutch striker is one player they could be enticed into selling.",
      "The Dutchman scored 22 goals and had 12 assists in 43 appearances last season but the Eredivisie giants are trying to secure a deal for Wout Weghorst from Burnley while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has also been linked with a move there.",

Brobbey is interested in a move to the Premier League and has previously been linked to Arsenal and Manchester United. The Red Devils even considered a swoop this summer, the despite the fact the striker previously rejected Erik ten Hag.",
      "Nketiah had been in talks over a £30million move to Nottingham Forest, but that broke down after personal terms could not be agreed. Marseille were also interested in the striker, but that deal also collapsed and they have since signed Elye Wahi from Lens instead.",
      "Crystal Palace have made an approach for Nketiah. It is claimed that the England international is open to joining them and talks are ongoing over personal terms, although several other clubs are also interested.",
      "Along with the departure of Jordan Ayew, Palace have also sold Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and Joachim Andersen to Fulham. Chadi Riad, Ismaila Sarr and Daichi Kamada have been brought in to strengthen the squad, but manager Oliver Glasner admits more new faces are needed.",

      "Sterling sought clarity from Chelsea after being left out of their matchday squad for the opening weekend of the season against Manchester City. The forner City man saw his opportunities limited after a busy summer, with Pedro Neto among the additions to Chelsea's squad under new manager Enzo Maresco, and Joao Felix has been added since that opening game.",
      "Sancho spent the second half of last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund after a public falling-out with United boss Erik ten Hag. The pair appeared to patch up their differences during the close-season, but a suitable offer could still tempt Ten Hag to allow the player to leave.",

      "Ugarte, 23, is finally, finally, joining from Paris St Germain for an initial £42.2million, with a further £8.4million in adds-ons, to allow both United and the Ligue 1 giants to say they got what they wanted. PSG should eventually get the £51million they demanded and which they paid Sporting Lisbon for him last year.",
      "United can point to the £42.2million up front fee and they have paid what they wanted all along. United identified Ugarte early in the window and feel the Uruguay midfielder, who began his medical on Tuesday before signing a five-year deal, can be a star for them after he was named in the Best XI at this summer’s Copa America.",

Ten Hag has big hopes for de Ligt and Mazraoui and sees the Dutchman as partnering Lisandro Martinez in the heart of their defence with the Tunisia defender operating at right-back.",

      "McTominay, who also began his medical on Tuesday, is joining Napoli for £25million, ending his 22 year-association with United and he first joined the club as a five-year-old. Their last big-name departure could be Jadon Sancho and the winger could go before Friday’s transfer deadline.",
      "Juventus are talking to United over Sancho, who has been welcomed back into the fold by ten Hag after their spectacular fall-out last season. However the Serie A side are not coming up with the numbers United want and the Old Trafford outfit will only accept loan offers if there is an obligation to buy.",
      "United paid Borussia Dortmund £73million for Sancho and accepting a loan offer with no commitment to make the deal permanent could see him returning to Old Trafford next July with just 12 months left on his contract.

      "Manuel Ugarte looks set to join Manchester United from Paris Saint-Germain, but the Uruguayan was close to signing for Chelsea one year previously",
      "Manchester United may be concerned by Chelsea's decision to pull out of signing Manuel Ugarte 12 months ago.",
      "The Uruguayan is understood to be travelling to Old Trafford for a medical ahead of a seismic move from Paris Saint-Germain, which is believed to be worth around £51million. His arrival will take Erik ten Hag's side's spending for this summer to around £180m, with the Dutch boss having already signed Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui, Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Ugarte, 23, could have been playing in blue this season, as the west Londoners were keen on bringing him to Stamford Bridge during the early days of Mauricio Pochettino's reign. It was understood that Chelsea agreed to pay the £51m release clause his former club Sporting Lisbon placed on him. However, PSG trumped the  Blues by offering a higher bid that Chelsea believed did not match Ugarte's qualities, causing the Blues to pull out of the race for his signature.",
      "Portuguese outlet Record, via football.london, also claimed that Chelsea offered him around £1.7m in wages per year. PSG reportedly offered him £4.3m per season, before suddenly deciding to double their offer to £8.6m. It was claimed at the time by Fabrizio Romano that Pochettino didn't want to risk putting Ugarte on a pedestal at Stamford Bridge and potentially upsetting other first-team players by agreeing to inflated wages.",
      "Chelsea opted not to match those sort of numbers and duly turned their attentions elsewhere. Instead, the Blues decided to shatter the Premier League transfer record to sign Moises Caicedo for £115m, before splashing out a further £53m to bring Romeo Lavia to the Bridge from Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "Ironically, the Blues spent even more money on their new midfield duo. Their decision suggests they had considerably more confidence in the ex-Southampton and Brighton & Hove Albion stars than the Uruguayan, which doesn't necessarily bode well for United given Chelsea's travails last season and the context of their other failed transfer incomings in the Todd Boehly era so far.",
      "Nevertheless, Ugarte arrives on the red side of Manchester with an impressive recent reputation. While his time with Luis Enrique in the French capital was not always perfect, Ugarte showed his quality in the recent Copa America.",
      "He played in every match for Uruguay, who went on to finish third by overcoming Canada in a penalty shootout. Ugarte's arrival is also expected to open the door for Scott McTominay to leave.",
      "The United academy prospect is set to seal an exciting move to Napoli, who are now managed by former Tottenham and Chelsea boss Antonio Conte. He will move to Italy for a fee expected to be around £25m.",
      "At present, Ten Hag will have the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro, and Christian Eriksen to choose from as well as Ugarte, while young prospects Toby Collyer and Daniel Gore may also be called upon by the Dutchman. The Red Devils have started the new campaign with a narrow 1-0 victory over Fulham and a dramatic, last-minute 2-1 defeat to Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "It's unclear as to whether Ugarte could be available for selection by the time United host Liverpool in their next Premier League match at Old Trafford.",

      "Jadon Sancho's dramatic time at Manchester United could be up as rumours of dramatic swap deal with Chelsea star Raheem Sterling swirl in the final days of the transfer window",
      "Jadon Sancho's Manchester United nightmare could be coming to an end as rumours swirl he's off to Chelsea - with Raheem Sterling potentially going the other way.",
      "The former Manchester City youth player's move to Borussia Dortmund saw him catch the eye of Europe's biggest clubs following a run of remarkable performances for the Black and Yellows. United eventually won the race for the winger, bringing him to Old Trafford for £72.9million in July 2021, and Sancho's blockbuster move looked to be the next big step for the youngster.",
      "Since then however, Sancho's time at United has been beset by poor form, injury and a very public falling out with United manager Erik ten Hag. So, as Chelsea and United reportedly thrash out one of the biggest deals of the summer, Mirror Sport takes a look at just what went wrong for Jadon Sancho at Manchester United.",
      "One of the driving forces behind Sancho's looming exit from United is his frosty relationship with Erik Ten Hag. Despite early promise between the two, with Sancho starring in the Dutchman's first pre-season with the club, Sancho's form began to dip, and an appearance against Chelsea in October 2022 proved to be his last in a United shirt for three months.",
      "Ten Hag was reportedly concerned with Sancho's form and, after being omitted from England's 2022 World Cup squad, the winger was packed off to train in the Netherlands while his team-mates enjoyed a warm-weather camp in Spain. It was during this time that Ten Hag claimed Sancho needed to work on \"a combination of physical but also mental” issues.",
      "The start of the 2023/24 campaign yielded some success for Sancho with the player making substitute appearances in United's first three Premier League games. He was then left out of a squad to face Arsenal and Ten Hag, once again, cited poor performances in training as the primary reason for his absence.",
      "Ten Hag said: \"Jadon, on his performance in training, was not selected. You have to reach a level at Manchester United every day.\" This then led to the biggest bombshell of all between the two - a sensational Twitter post by Sancho in which the player pleaded with fans to not \"believe everything you read\".",
      "The post went on to insinuate that Ten Hag was being dishonest and claimed he was being made a \"scapegoat\". In the wake of the tweet, the duo attempted to hash out their differences and are believed to have met up to clear the air.  While Sancho did eventually delete his inflammatory post, he allegedly refused to apologise to Ten Hag. On September 14th, United then released a statement saying that the player will “remain on a personal training programme away from the first-team group, pending resolution of a squad discipline issue”.",
      "After Ten Hag and Sancho's breakdown in relations, it was even reported that United's manager had taken things one step further by kicking the player out of United's WhatsApp group. The group was apparently run by staff to inform the first team of any updates and Sancho was said to be unhappy with the decision.",
      "United sources also confirmed the situation between the 24-year-old and Ten Hag has reached an \"impasse\", with no way back for the player until he decided to apologise for his social media post.",
      "With Sancho not having featured for United since September 2023 following his spat with Ten Hag, he saw the January transfer window as a prime opportunity to reignite his career elsewhere. He rejoined his former club, Borussia Dortmund, on loan, on January 11th of this year.",
      "The Germans reportedly paid a €4 million (£3.3million) loan fee to bring Sancho back to the Signal Iduna Park, and the switch proved to be a catalyst for the winger to rediscover his best form. “When I came into the dressing room today, it felt like ‘coming home’,” Sancho said after re-joining the German giants.",
      "His performances certainly mirrored his statement as he helped Dortmund climb the Bundesliga table, and most notably, assisted his side's unlikely Champions League charge that saw them reach the final at Wembley. Stellar performances in the competition's quarter and semi-finals against Atletico Madrid and PSG respectively looked like Sancho had become the player of old, and he even sent a damming message to the 'non-believers' following the win in Paris.",
      "Despite losing to Real Madrid in the final, Sancho was in a reflective mood after claiming on social media that he was \"grateful\" to be part of \"an amazing group of players\". In the same post he said that he felt like he was amongst \"family\" at BVB.",
      "Sancho managed three goals and three assists in his 21 appearances for the Black and Yellows. It was understood that Dortmund wanted to bring the player back to the club on a permanent basis but United's steep asking price, believed to be in the range of £50million, meant they had to reconsider their options.",
      "As recently as July, Ten Hag seemed to hint that Sancho had a future with United. Reports stated that the star had buried the hatchet with his manager and would be reintroduced to the United set-up.",
      "However the saga took a strange twist once more. Speaking publicly for the first time since the pair apparently patched things up, Ten Hag claimed that their bad blood had simmered, yet he remained tight-lipped and evasive when asked if Sancho had a future at the club.",
      "“As we said, we've drawn the line,” said Ten Hag. “Manchester United needs good players and Jadon is a good player. We have drawn that line and we move on.”",
      "Just over two weeks into the new campaign Sancho has just played seven minutes under Ten Hag, which came in a substitute appearance in their Community Shield victory over Manchester City. The new dawn for Sancho looks to have set early and he now finds himself on the brink of a move away from Old Trafford once again.",
      "Sancho isn't the only winger at a top Premier League club to find himself in limbo. Raheem Sterling has been the talk of the town since being frozen out of the Chelsea set-up under their new manager, Enzo Maresca.",
      "A stunning deal to take Sancho to Chelsea, and Sterling to United, is now reportedly being discussed. Despite the transfer deadline looming, The Telegraph have reported that Sancho is one of several players the Blues are looking at this week but a swap between the pair appears to be an extremely complex deal to get over the line.",
      "If a move to Stamford Bridge doesn't materialise it looks like Sancho could be on his way to Italy, with Serie A giant Juventus also taking a keen interest in Sancho's situation. Regardless of where the Sancho ends up come Friday at 11pm he will be hoping it's at a club where he can once again let his football do the talking.",

      "The Red Devils fell to a late 2-1 defeat to the Seagulls on Saturday. Danny Welbeck and Amad Diallo had exchanged strikes at the Amex Stadium before Joao Pedro headed home a stoppage-time winner.",
      "It was the sixth time in the Premier League that United had lost a game in the closing moments under Ten Hag. In contrast, they only conceded two winning goals after the 90th minute before the Dutchman took control at Old Trafford.",
      "That includes stints under Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Here we, take a look at all of the recent collapses over recent seasons.",
      "It took a few months for the Red Devils to concede their first stoppage-time winner under Ten Hag but it proved to be a painful one. Travelling to the Emirates 18 months ago, United got off to the perfect start with Marcus Rashford’s opening goal.",
      "But they weren’t ahead for very long as Eddie Nketiah levelled before Bukayo Saka put the Gunners ahead after the break. Ten Hag’s side thought they had stolen a point through Lisandro Martinez.",

      "Just a few months after Nketiah’s winner, the Red Devils were to face more Emirates frustration. And it was a familiar story.",
      "Rashford opened the scoring midway through the first half but that lead did not last particularly long as Granit Xhaka equalised for Mikel Arteta’s side. United thought they had secured victory as Alejandro Garnacho scored but his strike was ruled out due to a marginal offside decision.",

      "Eriksson passed away at the age of 76 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Rooney, who is now the manager of Plymouth Argyle, was one of the first of his former players to issue a heartfelt tribute to the Swede.",
      "The former Three Lions boss was the first manager to take a chance on the Manchester United legend, deploying him at Euro 2004 when he was just a teenager and the 2006 World Cup, despite suffering a metatarsal fracture on the eve of the tournament in Germany. Rooney was also sent off in the World Cup quarter-final against Portugal, which went on to cost the Three Lions a place in the semi-final.",
      "But while being knocked out by the Portuguese for a second consecutive major competition went on to be Eriksson's final game in the job, the Swede immediately looked to defend the young striker.",
      "When the red mist descended on Rooney after he trod on Ricardo Carvalho's crutch, Eriksson remembered the public vitriol David Beckham experienced when he was sent off in a similar manner in the 1998 World Cup. He recalled the national hatred which greeted Beckham when he returned to the country.",
      "Determined to ensure Rooney would not receive such a welcome, Eriksson did his best to shield Rooney from similar treatment. In his final press conference as manager, Eriksson said: \"You, more than me, need Wayne Rooney in the next few years so, please, pay attention.",
      "“Don't kill him, I beg you. Whether he did it intentionally or not, leave it. Take it easy with Rooney, for your own sake.",

      "Rooney tweeted his condolences and sadness about Eriksson's death. The 38-year-old said: \"Rest in peace, Sven. A special man. Thanks for the memories and all your help and advice. Thoughts and prayers with all his family and friends.\"",

      "Raheem Sterling appears to have little Chelsea future under Enzo Maresca and his thoughts on an exit have been revealed just days before the summer transfer window finally closes",
      "Raheem Sterling will only leave Chelsea on HIS terms after being told he has no future at the club.",
      "The former Manchester City winger is out of favour with new boss Enzo Maresca. After leaving him out of his first squad against the reigning champions, the Italian revealed it would be better for Sterling to look for opportunities elsewhere.",
      "The winger’s camp also released a statement demanding clarity from the Blues, particularly given the role he had played in pre-season, while he also had his squad number given to summer arrival Pedro Neto. Sterling has already been linked with a number of moves - Juventus and Aston Villa among those to have been offered the chance to sign him.",
      "Manchester United have emerged as an option with a potential swap deal involving Jadon Sancho under consideration. But it appears that Sterling will have the final decision over his future.",
      "The 29-year-old’s preference is to stay in the Premier League but it remains to be seen whether Chelsea can thrash out a deal with one of their domestic rivals. Now, according to The Sun, he will also only move to a club that he is happy with and is not intending to lodge a transfer request to force a move away from Chelsea.",
      "That would leave the club in a tricky position over the winger’s eye-watering contract. The club would need to agree a suitable severance package with their winger in order to get him off the books... or pay him big, in accordance with his contract.",
      "Chelsea’s sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart will lead talks with Sterling in an effort to come to an agreeable conclusion. But should that not occur, that would leave them in an extremely tricky position of having to pay Sterling’s lofty wages while out of favour.",
      "There is also a significant race against time with the summer transfer window set to slam shut on Friday evening. Sterling still has three years left on his current deal, while the next opportunity he would have to move to another Premier League club would be January.",
      "Sterling was signed in a £47m deal from Man City two years ago. He has made 81 appearances in all competitions since then and has scored 19 goals.",
      "Speaking about the ongoing situation last week, Maresca said: \"I spoke with Raheem, one-on-one the day before City and I explained him exactly the situation. I don’t see Raheem after the game. He is training apart as I said, but in case I sit with Raheem, I will tell him exactly the same things that I already told him. I don’t have anything new to tell him because I was quite clear.\"",

      "Sancho is also attracting plenty of interest, with both Chelsea and Juventus holding talks with the Red Devils over his future.

PSG should eventually get the £51million they demanded and which they paid Sporting Lisbon for him last year.",
      "United can point to the £42.2million up front fee and they have paid what they wanted all along. United identified Ugarte early in the window and feel the Uruguay midfielder, who began his medical on Tuesday before signing a five-year deal, can be a star for them after he was named in the Best XI at this summer’s Copa America.",
      "Ugarte will take their spending close to £200million for the summer and the Reds feel they have strengthened in all the positions they targeted. In signing Leny Yoro, 18, Joshua Zirkzee, 23, Matthjis de Ligt, 25, and Noussair Mazraoui, 26, they have also bought players with experience with their best years ahead of them.",
      "The Blues have reportedly made a move for Brentford frontman Ivan Toney.",

      "The Serie A giants have been linked with a move for the England winger as they aim to add to their wide options and have held talks over a potential deal. But their interest is now very much in the balance after the Bianconeri confirmed that they have signed Portuguese winger Francisco Conceição.",
      "The 21-year-old joins the club on loan until the end of the campaign from Porto, with, all being well, Juve hoping to seal a permanent deal next summer. for a player who had only just been re-signed by Porto on a permanent deal, having initially quit to join Ajax in 2022",
      "And Conceição is not the only winger that Juventus have signed over recent days. They also made a move for former Fiorentina winger Nico Gonzalez.",
      "Juventus have paid £7m to take him on loan for the season, while there is an obligation to buy the Argentine for a further £22m next summer. Those two deals could well see Sancho’s hopes of a move to Turin fall by the wayside.",
      "Manchester United may be concerned by Chelsea's decision to pull out of signing Manuel Ugarte 12 months ago.",
      "The Uruguayan is understood to be travelling to Old Trafford for a medical ahead of a seismic move from Paris Saint-Germain, which is believed to be worth around £51million. His arrival will take Erik ten Hag's side's spending for this summer to around £180m, with the Dutch boss having already signed Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui, Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Ugarte, 23, could have been playing in blue this season, as the west Londoners were keen on bringing him to Stamford Bridge during the early days of Mauricio Pochettino's reign. It was understood that Chelsea agreed to pay the £51m release clause his former club Sporting Lisbon placed on him. However, PSG trumped theBlues by offering a higher bid that Chelsea believed did not match Ugarte's qualities, causing the Blues to pull out of the race for his signature.",
      "Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha believes the club are selling Scott McTominay because he does not suit Erik ten Hag's style of play.",
      "\"Scott’s a great lad and I’m a bit sad to see him go because he’s a product of Manchester United’s youth academy and he’s always shown 100% commitment to the club,\" Saha told Betfred. \"The manager knows that Scott can play in different roles, adapt and still improve, but the style of play that Erik ten Hag’s looking to implement may not suit Scott.\"",
      "Jadon Sancho's Manchester United nightmare could be coming to an end as rumours swirl he's off to Chelsea - with Raheem Sterling potentially going the other way.",
      "The former Manchester City youth player's move to Borussia Dortmund saw him catch the eye of Europe's biggest clubs following a run of remarkable performances for the Black and Yellows. United eventually won the race for the winger, bringing him to Old Trafford for £72.9million in July 2021, and Sancho's blockbuster move looked to be the next big step for the youngster.",
      "Since then however, Sancho's time at United has been beset by poor form, injury and a very public falling out with United manager Erik ten Hag. And a stunning deal to take Sancho to Chelsea, and Sterling to United is now reportedly being discussed.",
      "Scott McTominay is set to fly to Italy to finalise his £25million move to Napoli, according to Sky Sports News.",

      "\"Until United get that manager in, they will struggle, there is an ideal candidate out there that can take the club forward with huge lift and match that expectation. That manager is Zinedine Zidane.",
      "\"Ten Hag hasn’t got it in his locker to attract big names, Zidane is an elite manager that can attract the biggest players in the world and get everyone back onside. The biggest names in world football will bend over backwards to come and play for Zidane if he's at Manchester United.",
      "\"At the moment United don’t have the pulling power to get in the players that will play attractive football and win major trophies again. United are coming off the worst season in the history of the club in terms of the Premier League era, they got knocked out of a relatively easy Champions League group and Ten Hag got a lifeline by winning the FA Cup.",
      "\"The word elite is a rare thing, Carlo Ancelotti is one of them, United need an elite manager on side to take the club forward and get that momentum back and until United do that, it’s going to be a dogfight.\"",

      "Mejbri, 21, featured in United’s win at Turf Moor last September, but has fallen down the pecking order of midfielders at Old Trafford and had an unsuccessful loan at Sevilla during the second half of last season.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has questioned Manchester United's decision to sell Scott McTominay to Napoli.",
      "The midfielder is set to move to the Serie A side in a £25million deal, though personal terms still need to be agreed. Ferdinand has been left stunned at the decision to let McTominay leave.",
      "He warned United boss Erik ten Hag that he is making a mistake in forcing out the Scot, even though he is not in his plans. \"I look at Scott McTominay and not every player can be a star, a standout player,\" Ferdinand told Vibe with Five.",
      "\"But to win the league you need the likes of John O’Shea, Wes Brown, Darren Fletcher… you need a Julian Alvarez at Man City. They might not start every game but they were huge, you need those players and most of them know the DNA of the club, especially ones who have come through the academy, there’s a lot to be said for that.",
      "\"It really doesn’t sit well with me. To replace him you’re going to have to spend £30m or £40m and give him £150,000 a week probably. It’s not going to be cheap and it’s a gamble, you don’t know what you’re going to get.\"",
      "Manchester United are closing on the signing of Manuel Ugarte after finally agreeing a fee with Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "The Uruguay midfielder is en route to Manchester to undergo a medical, after agreeing terms with PSG for the 23-year-old's signature.",
      "Ugarte is set to join United for an initial £42million, with a further £9million in add-ons. A formal agreement was reached between the two sides on Monday night.",
      "Manchester United have agreed a deal with Napoli to sell Scott McTominay – allowing them to move ahead with their transfer for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "United have been desperate to add Ugarte to their squad ever since they shelled out a potential £58million for Leny Yoro in mid-July. But the deal has been held up for financial reasons, with United needing to shift players first in order to comply with the Premier League ’s profit and sustainability rules.",
      "United have given the green light to the move after Napoli stumped up €30m (£25.4m) for McTominay. United have also negotiated a clause which will see them receive a share of any future transfer fee for the 27-year-old midfielder.",
      "Manchester United chiefs are set to reject Chelsea's offer of a swap deal involving Jadon Sancho and Ben Chilwell. Sancho is heading for the exit door at Old Trafford, having been left out of the squad for both of their games so far this season.",
      "The winger spent the second-half of last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund. But according to BBC Sport, United will now only sanction either a permanent move or a loan deal with an obligation to buy clause.",
      "In the hopes of doing a deal, Chelsea are understood to have suggested Chilwell as part of a swap deal. The left-back's career at the Blues is over, but United are said to 'not be keen' on signing him.",
      "Former Bayern Munich star Lothar Matthaus has slammed the decision to sell Matthijs de Ligt to Manchester United. The Dutchman moved to Old Trafford earlier this summer, but Matthaus believes the deal has left Bayern worse off.",
      "“Matthijs de Ligt was sold, even though he was the most stable defender over the past two years. He was the leader of the backline. Now Bayern are again looking for a successor to David Alaba. For me, it’s pathetic that this leader is missing,\" he told Sky Germany.",
      "“If de Ligt had not been sold, I would not have worries at FC Bayern now. But my opinion about him is probably different to the people in charge. It’s a decision that has to be accepted. The best defender for many is sold.”",
      "United's pursuit for Manuel Ugarte looks set to be a successful one. The Red Devils have been chasing the PSG midfielder for much of the summer, though have struggled to agree a fee with the French giants.",
      "But it now appears a compromise has been found in those discussions. According to Uruguayan newspaper El Pais, negotiations are 'practically closed' between the two sides, signalling a deal has been done.",
      "It is expected that Ugarte will soon make his way to Manchester to iron out the final details. There is unlikely to be any serious obstacle though and 'everything is on track' for Ugarte to become a United player.",

      "THE BIG DEBATE: We're into the final few days of the transfer window, so what bold predictions do our team have for moves that we could be seeing?",
      "The transfer window will soon be s̶l̶a̶m̶m̶i̶n̶g̶ s̶h̶u̶t̶ closing, but there's still plenty of time for a few deals to be wrapped up in the final few days before Big Ben goes bong.",
      "Manchester United are still set to be active in their pursuit of yet more midfield and attacking reinforcements, while Arsenal have been looking at wide players and Liverpool... well... Liverpool are yet to do anything at all really.",
      "So how will the final days of the window shape up then? We asked our Mirror Football team to make some bold predictions for what we could be about to see.",
      "Victor Osimhen will sign for Arsenal. There’s been a very simple reason why the Gunners have not won the Premier League the past two seasons - they haven’t had that 20-goal striker. And now there’s one ready and waiting for them.",
      "Osimhen has already made clear his desire to leave Napoli and talk from Italy suggests that both Chelsea and Arsenal are going head to head for his signature. The Blues could have an advantage given Romelu Lukaku’s impending move to Naples, but it has been suggested that they have already baulked at Osimhen’s lofty wage demands and are looking for alternatives.",
      "That could potentially give Arsenal the perfect opportunity to strike. Sure, any deal for the Nigerian will cost in excess of £100m. But that will represent an absolute bargain should his goals carry Arsenal to the title.",
      "Napoli will also be receiving an incredible amount for a player angling to leave, who has already helped them to silverware. If anything, this one makes too much sense.",
      "Everyone celebrates the end of a transfer window - because it means Sky Sports can put away that daft countdown clock, as if our lives all depend on whether Huddersfield Town are going to sign a fat left-back from Spain you've never heard of anyway.",
      "To date, and despite Chelsea's latest bout of ostentatious muscle-flexing, Premier League spending is £800 million down on the corresponding window last summer.",
      "But there's still time to offend the hard-up who can't afford their fuel bills, or the climate police by filling the skies with private jets where a perfectly reasonable alternative exists on a scheduled airline, so here goes...",
      "Victor Osimhen from Napoli to Chelsea - if the Blues can get rid of £80 million of excess ballast in that ridiculous 42-man squad.",
      "Giorgi Mamardashvili from Valencia to Liverpool , finally handing Arne Slot his first signing at Anfield in a position where he's already well-covered.",
      "And Mikel Merino to complete his £30 million move from Real Sociedad to Arsenal , which has been signposted more than London on the M1.",
      "Then we can all pour ourselves a large one and Manchester City win the title as usual (subject to 115 large ones).",
      "Perhaps this is the one that should happen, rather than will, but Manchester United still need a goalscorer and Ivan Toney still needs a move . It just makes too much sense.",
      "Brentford are resigned to losing the forward, having left him out of both of their Premier League matchday squads. United meanwhile look resigned to the fact they don't have a natural goalscorer. Watching their forward players toil against Brighton, it was painfully obvious what they were lacking.",
      "Even with Rasmus Hojlund they don't have a player capable of scoring 20-plus goals. A focal point like Toney would provide them with the kind of cutting edge so desperately needed. If United are seriously backing Erik ten Hag, then another striker is needed and as the hours of the window tick down, a desperate move for Toney should be on the cards.",
      "If Aaron Ramsdale has designs on a serious international career, he needs to get himself out of Arsenal by the end of this week .",
      "It looked like Ramsdale would be the Gunners' No.1 for the foreseeable future before Mikel Arteta made the decision to swoop for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya. And you cannot say that decision hasn't been justified. Which leaves Ramsdale in a tricky spot.",
      "Wolves have been linked with a move for his services, and it's a switch that makes sense in a whole manner of ways. Jose Sa continues to polarise opinion in the Black Country, and shipping six goals against Chelsea on Sunday hasn't helped his cause.",
      "Ramsdale hails from neighbouring Staffordshire and first-team opportunities at a club lower down the Premier League shouldn't harm his chances with England, as Jordan Pickford has shown.",
      "So Liverpool are signing definitely signing one player in Giorgi Mamardashvili, just one that won't be around until next season. Or maybe even the one after that. The lack of transfer activity at Anfield is understandable as a new manager seeks to get to know his squad but surely one or two come in for the here and now before the deadline?",
      "There is interest in the Italian winger Federico Chiesa who might end up joining, and I've got a feeling the Portuguese defender Goncalo Inacio will do too, swelling Arne Slot's squad before Friday's deadline. He's young, he's a left-sided centre-back and he can cover at left-back as well. He'd be a decent addition to a squad which has started well.",

      "Despite attaining almost unrivalled success as a Premier League manager, Sir Alex Ferguson kept things relatively simple when it came to one tradition in the transfer market",
      "The modern day Manchester United would do well to take inspiration from one of Sir Alex Ferguson 's transfer policies: sign the best player in the Premier League.",
      "Or at least the Scot would always make an attempt to recruit the player he felt was the standard-bearer of England's top flight at the time. That's according to Gary Neville, who lifted the lid on his old boss' tradition - which paid off more often than not.",
      "United's transfer portfolio is of more interest than ever before as the club looks to return to the glory days of old. However, the club would likely struggle to succeed in the same vein that Ferguson once did given the club no longer boasts the same pulling power as when he was in charge.",
      "\"There was a philosophy, I think, of buying. He wanted to bring young players through, and he wanted the best player in the Premier League,\" said Neville on a recent episode of The Overlap. \"I think if you had the best British player in the Premier League, he had to buy.",
      "\"Manchester United had to buy that player, and I think that's why they always had to. . .they broke transfer records for [Roy] Keane, they broke transfer records for [Wayne] Rooney, they tried to sign [Alan] Shearer, tried to sign [Paul] Gascoigne.",
      "\"So if you think about what he tried to do, he had a clear philosophy every single year. Even [Robin] van Persie, even though he wasn't British, he tried to sign the best Premier League player - and more often than not, they were British back then, but obviously now they're foreign players.\"",
      "It's a straightforward scheme, though perhaps one that wouldn't be as easy to pull off today as it was 20 or more years ago. And Erik ten Hag may struggle to convince certain stars from Manchester City, Arsenal or Liverpool that their silverware hopes were better served at Old Trafford in the current climate.",
      "United may have won the FA Cup last season, though the club is still coming off the back off an eighth-place league finish, their worst of the Premier League era. And despite some very promising transfer signings this summer, Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Brighton was the latest reminder there's work to be done.",
      "With less than a week of the summer transfer window remaining, Ten Hag is in a race against time to conduct any more business that would greatly improve his squad. That being said, forefather Ferguson found the best solutions to improving his own team was often the most simple.",

      "Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea could be among the sides looking to sell players during the final week of the 2024 summer transfer window as frantic business is set to be completed",
      "There’s now just a matter of days remaining of the 2024 summer transfer window and we’re into panic territory now.",
      "Clubs in the Premier League and beyond are scrambling around for any late deals they can do. Some will invariably be sucked into overspending on panic buys, while others could surprise with some eye-catching deals.",
      "It’s not just directors of football and managers desperately working hard for any last minute deals. Players will also be nervously waiting by the phone - whether they’re awaiting confirmation of that dream move, or they’re desperate to escape their current employers.",
      "While transfer windows all over Europe will close at different times, the race is on. With that being said, take a look at some players who will be hoping that they can put pen to paper on a switch over the coming days.",
      "We start with the most obvious one. Raheem Sterling looks to have little future at Chelsea - and has been told practically that by Enzo Maresca.",
      "He has no place in the squad and doesn’t even have a number. It’s just best for everyone if he leaves Stamford Bridge. Manchester United, Aston Villa and Juventus have all been linked but his huge wages might be a stumbling block.",
      "Staying with Chelsea (we’ll do that quite a lot), Sterling’s Blues teammate and England colleague Ben Chilwell also needs to quit Stamford Bridge to revive his career. Maresca has also told the former Leicester defender that he does not fit into his plans.",
      "Chilwell is still a more than capable fullback so a Premier League move would make the most sense. Manchester United have been touted as potential suitors in a swap deal involving Jadon Sancho.",
      "Who should your Premier League club sign? Share your suggestions in the comments below",
      "The final name in a Chelsea trio, Blues academy graduate Trevoh Chalobah has been banished from the club’s first-team facilities and also does not have a squad number. Should he decide to leave Stamford Bridge, he will not be short of suitors.",
      "The 25-year-old is certainly at a crossroads but can look to the likes of Fikayo Tomori, Tammy Abraham and Ruben Loftus-Cheek for proof that there is life after Chelsea. Wolves, Newcastle and moves abroad have all been mooted.",
      "While there is work to do at Chelsea to get their fringe players out, it already looks as though that is happening at Arsenal. Eddie Nketiah looked to be on the verge of a move away to Nottingham Forest but that deal has since collapsed.",
      "There are others interested in him though - most notably Crystal Palace. Nketiah has largely played second string over the past couple of seasons so a fresh start might do the striker good in the long run.",
      "From one English striker to another, Ivan Toney seems sure to leave Brentford this summer. The forward has just a year remaining on his contract - meaning the Bees are running out of chances to cash in on him.",
      "Thomas Frank has admitted that Toney could potentially leave. But it remains a mystery over where he will be. Premier League interest appears to have faded, leaving Saudi Arabia as the striker’s most likely destination - unless Chelsea or Arsenal appear late in the day.",
      "Sancho appears to be in a far better place than this time last year. The winger looked destined for the exit door after a very public falling out with Erik ten Hag and joined former club Borussia Dortmund months later.",
      "Things have improved but that has not seen Sancho rewarded with opportunities. He was left out of the Red Devils’ side vs Brighton and has been linked with a move to Chelsea, who like him but know doing a deal could be difficult. Juventus are still in the mix.",
      "The case of Joao Cancelo is one of the most baffling of recent seasons. The Portuguese defender was arguably the best fullback in the world during his peak.",
      "But he was then sent out on loan to Bayern Munich, while Cancelo also joined Barcelona on a temporary deal last term. He appears to have little future at the Etihad so will be very keen to get away from Manchester once again over the coming days. A switch to Saudi Arabia has been mooted.",
      "Scottish defender Kieran Tierney has been slightly unlucky during his time with Arsenal. Since joining the club from Celtic, he has been blighted by injuries and that has seen him drop down the pecking order.",
      "In an effort to earn some more playing time, he joined Spanish side Real Sociedad on loan last season. He could choose to pursue another move away over the final few days of the window.",
      "Sticking with players who sought out a loan move to Spain last season, goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga joined Real Madrid last term. Still the world’s most expensive stopper, his chances of first-team football appear very slim now he is back with Chelsea.",
      "Robert Sanchez is still the club’s number one, while Chelsea have signed Filip Jorgensen from Villarreal. Fortunately, Kepa already appears to have lined up a loan move to Bournemouth so will at least be playing some football this season.",
      "It’s a slight surprise that Scottish winger Fraser has not left Newcastle already. The 30-year-old spent last season on loan with Southampton.",
      "After scoring eight goals during the Saints’ promotion push, they remain keen to sign him permanently. As it stands, that has not happened. If it doesn’t, any chances of first-team football at St James' Park seem remote at best.",
      "It’s fair to say that Neal Maupay has endured an absolute nightmare time of things with Everton. After signing for £15m from Brighton two years ago, the French striker has scored just a solitary goal.",
      "The Toffees were happy to let him return to his former club Brentford on loan last term. His relationship with supporters is only more strained now after he criticised abusive fans for their angry tirade following a 4-0 defeat to Tottenham. Can they find a buyer?",
      "While Maupay has really struggled to find the net with his current club, the same can certainly not be said of Nigerian hitman Victor Osimhen. The 25-year-old has netted 76 goals in 133 appearances for the Italian giants.",
      "But it looks as though he’s ready for the next stage of his career. He asked to leave earlier this summer amid interest from Chelsea and Arsenal. Saudi clubs are also attempting to tempt him to the Middle East, but he wants to remain in Europe. Chelsea still appear most likely.",
      "Staying in Italy, it appears as though wideman Federico Chiesa will leave Juventus before the month is out. New Juve boss Thiago Motta has already suggested that he is not in his plans for the current season.",
      "Barcelona look set to make a move for him but it will be easier said than done. The Catalans’ dire financial situation means that they are struggling to register players so a move for Chiesa will not be straightforward and he may be forced to look elsewhere.",
      "Chiesa’s former Juventus teammate Adrien Rabiot is also on the lookout for a new club but there isn’t too much of a rush. The Frenchman left Juventus at the end of his contract with his contract expiring.",
      "He has regularly been linked with moves to Liverpool and Manchester United. He will still be able to sign for a new club after the end of the transfer window but will be keen to get a deal over the line sooner rather than later.",
      "Once Barcelona’s gem in their academy, Ansu Fati’s career has stuttered over recent seasons. He joined Brighton last season and scored four goals across what was an inconsistent campaign.",
      "New Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has hinted that he would be happy to keep Fati around. But the forward might hope for an opportunity elsewhere should he not feature in the German’s plans for the season.",

      "That chase comes as Jadon Sancho edges closer to an exit from Old Trafford. The winger was again left out of the squad which lost to Brighton with his time at United appearing to be all but over.",
      "Sancho's future is likely to be one of the biggest storylines over the final days of the window. Here, Mirror Football rounds up all the latest Manchester United transfer news.",
      "United's pursuit for Manuel Ugarte looks set to be a successful one. The Red Devils have been chasing the PSG midfielder for much of the summer, though have struggled to agree a fee with the French giants.",
      "But it now appears a compromise has been found in those discussions. According to Uruguayan newspaper El Pais, negotiations are 'practically closed' between the two sides, signalling a deal has been done.",

      "“If de Ligt had not been sold, I would not have worries at FC Bayern now. But my opinion about him is probably different to the people in charge. It’s a decision that has to be accepted. The best defender for many is sold.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand has questioned Manchester United's decision to sell Scott McTominay to Napoli.",
      "The midfielder is set to move to the Serie A side in a £25million deal, though personal terms still need to be agreed. Since graduating from United's academy, McTominay has become a regular fixture in their first-team.",
      "In total, the 27-year-old has made 255 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils. But he has fallen down the pecking order under Erik ten Hag, with the Dutchman pursuing a move for another midfielder in PSG star Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Despite that Ferdinand has been left stunned at the decision to let McTominay leave. He warned United boss Ten Hag that he is making a mistake in forcing out the Scot, even though he is not in his plans.",
      "\"I look at Scott McTominay and not every player can be a star, a standout player. But to win the league you need the likes of John O’Shea, Wes Brown, Darren Fletcher… you need a Julian Alvarez at Man City,\" Ferdinand told Vibe with Five.",
      "\"They might not start every game but they were huge, you need those players and most of them know the DNA of the club, especially ones who have come through the academy, there’s a lot to be said for that.",
      "\"It really doesn’t sit well with me. To replace him you’re going to have to spend £30m or £40m and give him £150,000 a week probably. It’s not going to be cheap and it’s a gamble, you don’t know what you’re going to get.",
      "\"Whereas with McTominay you know what you’re getting. He might not always be a 9/10 but invariably he’s a solid 7/10 and sometimes he will be an 8/10 and get you a goal.\"",
      "McTominay still has a year to run on his contract at United, but selling him would represent 'pure profit' when it comes to the Premier League's financial rules. Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna has held extensive talks with United over a move for the midfielder.",
      "Earlier this summer, United rejcted a £20m bid from Fulham, who moved on to other targets. The decision to sell McTominay represents something of a U-turn, after Ten Hag claimed he wanted the Scot to remain at the club.",
      "“We have very good players so there will always be an interest from other clubs. When you score 10 goals in a season and also perform very good for Scotland, then there will be an interest,\" the Dutchman said in July.",
      "\"But we want to keep him because he is a very important player for our squad. What he can contribute, as we saw last season once we had our sixes available, he could play in a more advanced role and he is a highly interesting player for our team.”",

      "The former England captain, who led his country throughout Sven-Goran Eriksson's spell as manager of the national team, recently visited the Swede at his home for a final meeting before his death was announced on Monday",
      "When David Beckham travelled to Sweden to meet Sven-Goran Eriksson this summer, the pair knew it would be the final time.",
      "The former England captain has spoken to his former Three Lions boss and understood that time was short for the 76-year-old, who revealed in January that he was fighting against pancreatic cancer. On Monday, the Swede, who led England for five years, overseeing two World Cups - reaching the quarter-finals on both occasions - and Euro 2024 - another last eight appearance - and that 5-1 win in Germany in 2001, passed away.",
      "But in his final meeting with his former skipper, Eriksson told the former Manchester United and England superstar: \"It will be OK.\"",
      "Eriksson revealed in January that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and had been told he had “best case” a year to live. That led to an outpouring of love and support across the globe, while Eriksson was given the opportunity to manage his beloved Liverpool in a charity match at Anfield in March.",
      "Eriksson admitted he had shed tears before and after the Liverpool ‘Legends’ match, and said: “To sit on the bench for Liverpool, that’s been my dream my whole life. Now it happened, and it was a beautiful day in all meanings. It’s a good finish, to finish with Liverpool, it can’t be much better than that.”",
      "As Eriksson's condition worsened, Beckham flew to Sweden to meet Sven at his home in Sunne, overlooking Lake Fryken, the place where Eriksson's ashes may now be scattered. They stood, they spoke, they walked, they cried, an increasingly fragile yet determined Sven at times needing to use Beckham to remain upright.",
      "In a post shared on social media following the announcement of Sven's death on Monday, Beckham emotionally declared: \"We laughed, we cried and we knew we were saying goodbye...",
      "\"Sven thank you for always being the person you have always been, passionate, caring, calm and a true gentleman. I will be forever grateful for you making me your captain but I will forever hold these last memories of this day with you and your family.",
      "\"Thank you Sven and in your last words to me: \"It will be OK\".",
      "Italian lawyer Nancy Dell’Olio also paid tribute to her “ex-husband” on Instagram. The 63-year-old said: “It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of my ex-husband, Sven. Though our relationship had its ups and downs, I choose to remember the good times we shared and the moments that brought joy to our lives.",
      "“I will always hold onto those cherished memories and extend my deepest condolences to his family, as well as his beloved children, Lina and Johan. When you love someone, that love never truly fades. Rest in peace, Sven. You will be missed.”",
      "Although they were in a relationship between 1998 and 2007, the pair had not previously been thought to have been married.",
      "Wayne Rooney described Eriksson as a “special man” as he paid his tribute too. Taking to social media, Rooney wrote: “Rest in peace, Sven. A special man. Thanks for the memories and all your help and advice. Thoughts and prayers with all his family and friends.”",
      "Rooney’s old England team-mate Michael Owen, who was the hat-trick hero in the 5-1 rout of Germany in Munich in 2001 - the highlight of Eriksson’s reign as manager - described the Swede as “one of the very best”.",
      "“Rest In Peace Sven-Goran Eriksson. One of the very best and a man who will be sadly missed by everyone in the world of football,” Owen wrote.",
      "Current England captain Harry Kane paid tribute to the Swede in a post on Instagram too. Kane said: “I didn’t have the privilege of playing under Sven but I know how well liked and respected he was by those who played under him as England manager. My thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.”",
      "Former FA executive director David Davies paid his own tribute, saying on Sky Sports: “I think it was his charm, his politeness, his intelligence and his kindness, his immense kindness over many years. He was outwardly unflappable.”",
      "Inter Milan manager Simone Inzaghi thanked Eriksson for the influence he had on his career when he played under the Swede at Lazio, winning the Serie A title in 1999-2000 among other honours.",
      "“The passing of Sven-Goran Eriksson is a great pain for me,” Inzaghi said on the Inter website. “He was fundamental in my growth as a footballer and as a man. I admired his calm, his education, the great respect he had for everyone.",
      "“Sven was a great man, an example of life for everyone. These last months faced with great strength and a unique desire to live have been a further demonstration of his greatness: he taught us to live while he was dying.”",
      "The FA have confirmed that tributes will be paid to Sven when England next play at Wembley, against Finland in the UEFA Nations League, on September 10.",

      "Manchester United legend Dwight Yorke has warned Marcus Rashford that only he can drag himself out of this slump.",
      "The new Premier League season is only two games old, yet the former England international's form is already worrying United fans and ex-players. Rashford failed to have a shot on goal in the 1-0 victory over Fulham and the recent 2-1 away defeat by Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "This slow start precedes the last campaign, which saw him only contribute seven goals and three assists in 33 Premier League appearances for Erik ten Hag's side. Over this period, he has also been outshone by the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, who is still being left on the bench in place of Rashford.",
      "Rashford was also left out of Gareth Southgate's England squad which reached the final of Euro 2024. With the 26-year-old disappointed to be snubbed by the Three Lions boss, Yorke admits he is surprised with Rashford's tepid start to the season.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Yorke said: \"You have to find out where the individual is at, what is going through his head, what is his thought process in his everyday life. At the end of the day, we all have issues, we all have tough times in our lives.",
      "\"I am sure that being left out of the England set-up last year, you expect him to come back with a little bit of fire in his belly and kick on after a poor season by his standards. Marcus Rashford is the only person who can get himself out of that slump.",
      "\"You can bring in the best coaches around him, but he has to have that burning desire to get himself back. We know he has all the talent and all the ability.",
      "\"But if he is not prepared to put that effort in and really bring himself back from his poorest season last year, he is not going to get back to that level. He has to want to do it.",
      "\"I have defended Marcus many times, but he just seems unhappy. For whatever reason I don't know, but just does not seem to be enjoying his football like he used to.”",
      "Rashford has the perfect opportunity to hit back at the critics when United host Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday, September 1.

I know they have got [Rasmus] Hojlund out injured but when he comes in he's going to have to improve that because, on today's evidence and in the game against Fulham, it's not been anywhere near good enough.\"",

      "Raheem Sterling could make the move to Manchester United this summer - with Enzo Maresca making his stance on the England legend clear as the 2024/25 Premier League campaign unfurls",
      "Raheem Sterling has already made his thoughts on Manchester United clear as a potential transfer to Old Trafford looms.",
      "The 29-year-old has been dropped by new Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca as the 2024/25 campaign kicks off, failing to even make it as far as the bench for the west London side's games against Manchester City and Wolves. On top of this, the Italian has stripped Sterling of his patented No 7 and has sent him away from training with the first team.",
      "And while Sterling's current club are open to offers for the forward - who still has years left in him - nothing has come to fruition as of yet. Maresca has welcomed a wealth of signings to Stamford Bridge this summer, including marquee signings like Pedro Neto and Joao Felix, but he could have more work to be done ahead of Friday's deadline.",
      "One deal that Maresca is reportedly considering is a swap deal which would see Sterling head back to Manchester - albeit in a red shirt - in return for 24-year-old Jadon Sancho, who hasn't managed to break through under Erik ten Hag just yet. Sancho has also been omitted from his side's squads for their Premier League openers against Fulham and Brighton, after returning from a hit-and-miss loan spell with Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho featured in just 14 Bundesliga games for Die Schwarzgelben across the 2023/24 campaign, and with Marcus Rashford heavily in favour at Old Trafford, it looks unlikely that the left-winger will get any game time under Ten Hag. And should a deal come to light between Chelsea and Manchester United come to fruition before Friday, the Red Devils will certainly have an advantage going forward.",
      "That's because Sterling has admitted that he was previously a Manchester United fan, speaking about how he used to don the famous red shirt in his younger years. Speaking to The Mirror in 2019, Sterling confessed: \"I shouldn't really say this - not now, definitely not now! - but when I was young I was a massive United fan.\"",
      "He added: \"I had an old United kit, from when they won the last FA Cup. I was at the final in 2007.\" In a similar turn of events, it recently came to knowledge that Sancho was also a Chelsea fan when he was growing up - idolising the likes of Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT back in 2019, the star said: \"I was a Chelsea fan growing up, I can’t lie. Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard were my favourite players at the time.\" Sterling has had quite the fall from grace from his glory days at Manchester City.",
      "The England international came up through the ranks of the Liverpool youth academy before making his professional debut for the first team in 2012. He went on to score 23 goals in 129 appearances on Merseyside before Pep Guardiola and City came a-knocking in 2015 with a deal rising to £49million.",
      "Over the next seven years, Sterling scored 131 in 339 games for the Citizens, lifting four Premier League titles, five League Cups and an FA Cup and a Community Shield a-piece. Many fans questioned his shock move to Chelsea in 2022, but Sterling later revealed that he was unhappy in Manchester towards the end of his tenure.",
      "Things have been far from smooth sailing with Chelsea however, being phased out of the side ahead of the new Premier League season by new boss Maresca, who has plenty of players to pick and choose from in attack. Cole Palmer, Christopher Nkunku and Noni Madueke have all found favour at Stamford Bridge thus far, as well as new boys Felix and Neto.",

      "Manchester United have agreed a fee with Paris Saint-Germain to sign Manuel Ugarte, who is set to travel to Manchester today to undergo a medical ahead of his move to Old Trafford.",
      "United have been pursuing the 23-year-old holding midfielder throughout the summer transfer window and after lengthy negotiations with PSG they have now agreed a fee of €50m (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons. Ugarte will now have his medical before signing a contract with United.",
      "United had identified Ugarte as the ideal player to strengthen their midfield early in the summer but were reluctant to match PSG's asking price of a €60m fixed fee and they believe this deal shows their patient approach to the negotiations has worked, landing an attractive deal for a player they rate highly.",
      "Ugarte made the Copa America Best XI at this summer's tournament in the United States, which further enhanced United's view of him as one of the best young midfielders in the game.",
      "The Uruguayan has been desperate to make the switch since learning of United's interest and he has been left out of PSG's opening Ligue 1 games of the season, with the French giants also in need of a sale to ease their Financial Fair Play concerns after a net spend of more than €400m across the previous two summers.",
      "United had their own issues with FFP and the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) to balance but the impending departures of midfielders Scott McTominay and Hannibal Mejbri, to Napoli and Burnley respectively, have given United breathing room in the final week of the window and PSG's need to sell has led to the two clubs agreeing a permanent deal, having also explored the possibility of a loan with an obligation to buy.",
      "United had also explored alternative options in midfield, but their interest in Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi cooled quickly while a return for Sofyan Amrabat was always seen as less attractive than signing Ugarte, who impressed for Uruguay in this summer's Copa America.",
      "Although it has taken a while to agree the terms of a deal, key figures in United's new-look football structure had expressed confidence two weeks ago that they would land Ugarte before this Friday's deadline, which is why he had remained their top target for so long.",
      "Ugarte will become the fifth signing of the window and will take the club's spending to over £200m. He follows the additions of Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",

      "The nature of Manchester United's defeat to Brighton on Saturday and the doom cycle that never seems far away from this club has made sieving the positives out of the weekend a difficult task.",
      "United have been undeniably better in their first two league games of this season than they were for most of 2023/24, but that has only produced one win and one defeat. And those improvements aren't enough if this team continues to make defensive errors in the way that they did at the Amex.",
      "They let the game open up late on, chasing a win that for the last 10 minutes felt more likely to end in defeat, then allowed themselves to become dishevelled defending an injury-time corner. As Joao Pedro's header flashed past Andre Onana, any immediate desire to alight on positives had been parked.",
      "But that doesn't mean that there weren't things for Erik ten Hag to take from the game. United had more control in the first half, they looked a threat on the break in the second half and Amad took his goal well. But for an unfortunate or unnecessary (depending on your view) offside they would have got at least a point, if not all three.",
      "Maybe the biggest positive from the games against Fulham and Brighton has been the way United have pressed. It has been more aggressive than last season and more structured, which has made it more difficult to play through.",
      "Ten Hag would point to injuries to explain why this element of United's game never really worked last season. They weren't compact enough to press successfully and did so only sporadically. So far this season, there appears a renewed commitment to press the opposition.",
      "It was particularly noticeable on the south coast and in the first half it worked well. Brighton found it difficult to find any rhythm when playing out from the back and twice United won the ball high up the pitch, immediately creating a dangerous attacking position.",
      "The coaching changes made at Carrington this summer might have helped United improve this side of their game. In Rene Hake, they have appointed a coach with a reputation for pressing in the Netherlands. His Go Ahead Eagles side didn't always press during a successful Eredivisie season last term, but when they did they did so with aggression and with success.",
      "You get the impression Hake has made an impact on that side of United's game. It can only benefit Ten Hag having another respected and successful coach helping to fine-tune the way the team presses and if Hake is making his mark, then there should be more to come.",
      "When Ten Hag survived Ineos' end-of-season review in June, one condition of remaining as manager was to rejig his coaching staff. The goalkeepers have spoken highly of the innovative Jelle ten Rouwelaar, the attackers will benefit from working with Ruud van Nistelrooy and Hake's credentials speak for themselves.",
      "It was a change Ineos were keen to see, having decided the dynamic between Ten Hag and his former assistant Mitchell van der Gaag wasn't working for the players. So far, it looks like it's a change that was well worth pushing through and one that Ten Hag deserves credit for embracing.",
      "Ineos will hope what is now an experienced coaching group can continue to develop this team, ironing out those mistakes and decisions that cost United dearly at Brighton. It will also be fascinating to see how they develop as a pressing team this season.",
      "The decision to play Bruno Fernandes as a false nine and Mason Mount just behind him is ideal if you want to press teams. Mount's intelligence to press is excellent and Fernandes has a relentless work rate. He forced Lewis Dunk to concede a very cheap corner on Saturday.",
      "At some point, Ten Hag will start either Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund. Fernandes will then move back and Mount might even drop out of the team. That will be another test of the coaching set-up now in place at Carrington, but the early signs are promising.",

      "\"He is a Chelsea player, absolutely,\" said Pep Guardiola about Raheem Sterling last Friday.",
      "Chelsea have made Sterling surplus to requirements and Guardiola poured cold water over the possibility of Manchester City re-signing the winger at his press conference.",
      "\"So I just wish him all the best. If you ask me this question when Gundo was in Barcelona, the answer: the same,\" Guardiola added. City will not re-sign Sterling but it's not beyond the realms of possibility that he returns to Manchester, this time making a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It must be stressed the chances of Sterling making a sensational move to Manchester United are slim, however, stranger things have happened and shocking transfers can happen.",
      "Sterling could move to United in a swap deal for Jadon Sancho, but Juventus are currently frontrunners to sign the 24-year-old and talks would have to collapse for that move to spark.",
      "It's understood Sterling would be open to a move to United if Juventus fail to progress with a deal for Sancho and several dominos would have to fall perfectly for that to materialise.",
      "United have stressed they would only be prepared to do deals that would aid their profitability and sustainability calculations for next year. United also have two wingers on the right and left-hand sides, with Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount also considered as options on the right.",
      "A move to Juventus for Sancho makes sense, given he seems most effective when playing abroad, and it's impossible not to think that United would be signing the wrong former City player if a swap deal with Sterling somehow got the greenlight before the transfer deadline.",
      "Sterling is 29 years old, entering the autumn of his career and has regressed since leaving City. His move to Stamford Bridge hasn't gone as hoped and he hasn't been included in the England squad since the 2022 World Cup, despite having been one of the Three Lions' best performers - he was talismanic at Euro 2020 - throughout Gareth Souhtgate's eight-year tenure.",
      "There's still a feeling that Sterling has more to offer and there could be a huge upside attached to a deal for whoever signs him next, but he has the profile of a player who United signed during the Glazers' time running the club - a player potentially past his best - and would be a risk.",
      "United must look to the future and there has been an obvious change in policy since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's new football structure has been implemented, with younger players being signed.",
      "Ratcliffe wants to sign players with their best years ahead of them and sources admitted that when Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui arrived from Bayern Munich. Sterling's best years seem behind him but that doesn't apply to his Chelsea teammate Cole Palmer.",
      "Palmer is a City academy graduate but famously supported United growing up. A picture of Palmer wearing a 2010/11 United shirt went viral on social media last season and he revealed in an interview that he idolised Wayne Rooney, who was his \"hero\", when he was a kid.",
      "Carlos Tevez is the most recent player to have represented United and City - Jadon Sancho never played a senior game at the Etihad - and if any player is going to have both clubs on his CV in the near future then it feels likely to be Palmer, who has been outstanding for Chelsea.",
      "Chelsea will do everything they can to keep Palmer. He has just been named the PFA Young Player of the Year following his breakout season in London, he contributed 27 goals and 15 assists last term and Chelsea wouldn't have qualified for European competition without him.",
      "Palmer only signed a contract extension earlier this month to extend his deal until 2033 (yes, really), but Chelsea are a basketcase club with Todd Boehly in charge and he might be forced to leave in the next few years if they aren't matching his ambition in the Premier League and beyond.",
      "It wouldn't be easy or cheap to prise Palmer away from Chelsea, but he is the kind of player that would be perfect for United and he once dreamed of playing in a red shirt.",
      "Sometimes dreams do come true and maybe one day Palmer will play at Old Trafford.",

      "Scott McTominay could undergo a medical in Naples today as he edges closer to completing a £25m move to Serie A side Napoli.",
      "The Manchester United midfielder is set to travel to Italy to finalise a transfer that would see him end his 22-year association with his boyhood club, with the two clubs agreeing a fixed fee for the 27-year-old.",
      "McTominay is attracted by the idea of a new challenge at a club that won the Serie A title in 2022/23 and enjoy significant support. The Scotland international is also keen on the idea of playing in a new league and Napoli boss Antonio Conte had hoped to land him.",
      "United were reluctant to lose their academy graduate, having rejected a £30m offer from West Ham for him last August, before he then went on to enjoy his best season at the club, scoring 10 times last season.",
      "But a combination of McTominay's desire to play regularly and the attraction of selling academy players under the Premier League's financial rules has led to them agreeing a deal with Napoli, having turned down an offer from Fulham earlier in the window.",
      "McTominay has come off the bench in all three of United's competitive games so far this season and although he started the FA Cup final in May, there was an expectation he would have to settle for a bit-part role this season.",
      "United had been unable to sell Casemiro, having considered offloading the Brazilian earlier in the window, and the impending arrival of Manuel Ugarte, coupled with the return to form and fitness of Mason Mount, had left McTominay on the fringes and United were unable to guarantee him the starting position he wanted.",
      "The Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) also incentivise the sale of academy players, who go down as pure profit in the books for the financial year. That makes a £25m fee for McTominay more attractive and his departure will help fund the £42.3m move for Ugarte, who is set for his United medical on Tuesday.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window has largely been a success. Things can change quickly entering the final days of the month but Ineos' first big task has so far been bypassed without too much of a hitch.",
      "The early chase for Jarrad Branthwaite didn't descend into saga-like chaos as has been the case previously (see Frenkie de Jong), and despite Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui both taking a bit longer than would have been ideal, two key additions were made. Joshua Zirkzee already looks like a good piece of business for the £35million he cost.",
      "United have recouped some fees back as well, already overtaking their total incomings from last year with the promise of at least one more high (ish) profile exit. In fact, it was 2019 when the club last made this much back from a single summer and that was headlined by Romelu Lukaku.",
      "Should Scott McTominay depart then there's every chance the 2024 window overtakes that. Only the repair job of 2015 and Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid move in 2009 will then be ahead of it. Erik ten Hag may well hope that this year can go the extra step though as it will mean Victor Lindelof is also off the books.",
      "The same is true of Jadon Sancho. A permanent deal away from Old Trafford for him would seal the most lavish selling spree in the club's history. Meanwhile, they have addressed the problem areas in the squad without being tempted by walking red flags and agent offers.",
      "Although Manuel Ugarte carries with him some doubts over mobility and the impact of passing, signing a new midfielder was paramount. What United are getting after a transfer was agreed is exactly what Ten Hag has been after: an anchor to break up and disrupt play. Give the ball to Kobbie Mainoo and move on.",
      "As long as the club doesn't get tempted at the last minute to ditch their well-thought-out summer plans in favour of Raheem Sterling, a quietly impressive window is on the cards. What is needed after Ugarte to complete this though?",
      "Here, Manchester Evening News writers give their thoughts.",
      "On Monday I wrote that it wouldn't surprise me if United did actually go for the Sterling-Sancho swap. Perhaps that was being disingenuous to what Dan Ashworth and Co have actually been working towards this window. United's business hasn't been seamless, it hasn't been quiet, but it has been refreshingly different to past years.",
      "Sterling is nothing United need, especially not in place of Sancho. Really, the less we hear about the Red Devils this week, the better. It really should be just sales and locking up.",
      "McTominay out, fine. For £25million United definitely could have gotten more, and there's a good argument that with European football to come he has a role to play. The decision has been taken to sell him though and getting it over the line rather than running things down too much is a good idea.",
      "Selling Lindelof will be harder. Where is the interest in an ageing defender who has 12 months on his contract and is totally out of favour? If it's not a move to Turkey then really, nobody is going to pay decent money for him.",
      "Sancho is the one to look out for. All parties appear to want the same thing here but getting as close to a permanent resolution as possible would be an achievement. The last thing anyone wants is to be back in this loan-sale purgatory next summer. Take £30million and run.",
      "Ugarte looks to be a sensible signing for United and one which should fix an obvious problem in Ten Hag's squad. The Uruguayan is a younger and more mobile version of Casemiro and should be able to provide a greater platform for Kobbie Mainoo to flourish going forward.",
      "But if a deal cannot be struck to sign Brentford striker Ivan Toney, then the 23-year-old should be United's final summer signing. The priority needs to be getting rid of players who are well past their sell-by date at United - mainly Jadon Sancho and Victor Lindelof.",
      "Selling the Swedish defender may be more difficult due to his injury, however, Sancho clearly has no future at Old Trafford and him staying in Manchester is only going to hurt Ten Hag's team. Overall though it's been a pretty good transfer window for United.",
      "United's signings this summer have made it clear they want to fight for a place in the top four after last season's disappointing eighth-place finish. Their persistence in securing the services of Manuel Ugarte shows just that.",
      "With Ugarte on his way to Old Trafford and the likes of McTominay and Hannibal Mejbri on their way out, United's next focus should be to cash in on Sancho. I struggle to see he has any future at the club despite resolving his differences with Erik ten Hag.",
      "There are some clubs interested in sealing his signature, and I think United should take any good offer that comes their way. Having not played in the first two games of the season, his value could decrease significantly between now and January if he doesn't get minutes throughout the season. It could become increasingly difficult to get a good fee for him.",
      "With the central midfielder box ticked, if you are a United fan the heart would be wanting to make the next transfer an addition to the attack - preferably a centre-forward. However, realistically the next transfer now needs to be a departure.",
      "Mejbri is on the way out but it now seems time to allow Scott McTominay to go. Rio Ferdinand voiced his concerns about the transfer this week and it is understandable.",
      "At the same time, the Reds have an abundance of central midfielders and if Casemiro cannot be sold someone like McTominay was always going to be on the chopping block. The pressure though is ramped up on Erik ten Hag with this strategy considering he is choosing to back Mason Mount to come good instead of a academy graduate.",
      "Only time will tell if this is the right call or not but I think the Scottish international's sale will be next on the agenda for the Reds.",
      "When you look at United's summer transfer business, they have virtually strengthened in every area they needed to apart from one. Erik ten Hag has signed two new centre-backs, a centre forward and a right-back - and is on the verge of signing a new central midfielder in the form of Manuel Ugarte.",
      "I feel that United are a left-back away from a near-perfect window on the incoming front. They desperately need to add a new one to the squad with Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia unreliable due to their damning injury records. Now, deciding which one United should target is the tricky question.",
      "Ben Chilwell does look an obvious option with his Chelsea future uncertain, but United should avoid that one as he has struggled with injuries over the years. Instead, I would suggest Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez. He has been impressive since arriving in the Premier League, and although he would fix the short-term need, he would provide a longer term requirement in that role.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands that United are only realistically looking to bring in one more player - Manuel Ugarte. While Scott McTominay, Hannibal Mejbri and Jadon Sancho could all leave, the club seem unlikely to spend again this window.",
      "However, if there was one area they could look at, it is at left-back where Luke Shaw is once again injured and Tyrell Malacia is still to return from last summer’s knee operation. A loan deal for an unwanted player is probably more likely than, say, a Ben Chilwell purchase.",
      "The question is whether anyone of that ilk would be worth bringing in given the covering Diogo Dalot, a right-back, has provided astute displays in the role when Shaw and Malacia might be back before long. But then, United fans heard that line last season...",

Any swap deal is likely to have to see both players reduce their wages for a transfer to go ahead, but if that can be sorted, then it could be an ideal scenario for all parties.",
      "Both players and clubs find themselves in a similar situation with a transfer away from their current sides probably the best outcome. Sterling has been forced to train away from the Chelsea first team after falling out of favour under new head coach Enzo Maresca.",
      "A swap deal would also see both players join the team that they grew up supporting. Back in the summer of 2021, Sancho revealed how he was a Chelsea fan as a child.",

      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Uruguayan will strengthen an obvious weak spot in Erik ten Hag's team by offering greater protection to a back four which has been left endlessly exposed time under the Dutchman. Pressure will now be on the former Ajax boss to deliver better results and ensure United return to the Champions League at a minimum.",
      "Depending on how quickly his medical at Carrington is completed, the 23-year-old could make his United debut in Sunday's huge fixture against Liverpool at Old Trafford. It's set to be a baptism of fire for the Reds' latest recruit.",
      "Ugarte will be United's fifth summer signing in what has been on paper a good window. Striker Joshua Zirkzee and defenders Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui have all been brought in to strengthen Ten Hag's side.",
      "And United will soon have several good options in every position once Ugarte's transfer to the club is completed. The midfielder's arrival could also provide a platform for Kobbie Mainoo to flourish in attacking areas.",
      "The teenager has often looked restricted alongside Casemiro, having needed to make up for some of the spaces the ageing and less mobile Brazilian has left vacant. Whilst there are some doubts over Ugarte's passing ability, the technical quality within United's best-starting line-up should make up for that.",
      "When fit, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw are United's best options at full-back whilst De Ligt and Yoro provide a solid base in central defence. Ugarte could then play in a deep-lying role as part of Ten Hag's favoured 4-3-3 formation or alongside Mainoo in a 4-2-3-1.",
      "Fernandes will be able to play further forwards to support a three-pronged attack which includes the pace and skill of Alejandro Garnacho and Amad. Rasmus Hojlund meanwhile is probably still United's best striker.",
      "United's strongest XI with everyone fit: Onana, Dalot, De Ligt, Yoro, Shaw, Ugarte, Mainoo, Fernandes, Garnacho, Amad, Hojlund",
      "Manchester United made history 25 years ago by becoming the first English club to win the Treble.",
      "This stunning Manchester Evening News souvenir special looks at the men behind the triumph, the key moments, the big matches, the astonishing comebacks.",
      "",
      "David Beckham, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs – perhaps the finest midfield quartet in the history of the British game. Peter Schmeichel and Jaap Stam, two of the rocks at the back upon which the Treble triumph was built. The fab four up front - Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Leny Yoro has been told he is in a race against the clock to make it back in time for the Christmas period following surgery on his foot.",
      "During the clash with Arsenal in the United States, Yoro picked up an unfortunate foot injury which ended his hopes of being fit and available for the start of the season. Three weeks ago, the Frenchman underwent successful surgery on his injury and is now in the process of undertaking rehabilitation.",
      "Over the bank holiday weekend, the former Lille man hinted he could be returning to United action sooner rather than later as he posted a sand timer emoji along with a picture of him walking out of a tunnel in the Reds' kit. While hope among the fans is that he will be back sooner rather than later, injury expert and Online Slots Real Money ambassador Ben Dinnery is more pessimistic on the defender's return date.",
      "\"It is difficult to put a concrete return date in because obviously they do vary depending on the individual and of course other factors,\" Dinnery told MEN Sport. \"Typically we are looking in the region of about 80-90 days to return to playing.",
      "\"That could potentially be expedited, we have had players return within that 80 day period but it has on occasions extended way beyond that. That comes down to the type of surgery but historically it has always been around those timeframes - week two you should be doing this, week three you might be doing that.",
      "\"However, now it is about incorporating the rehab and the recovery around key points within that so once you get to a certain point, then you progress. A player might take ten days and then somebody else 20 days.",
      "\"It really comes down to the individual and Ten Hag will be looking at other factors that will influence [his return] like how things are going on the pitch, where they are in terms of availability of other players, the depth of the squad and how it will be utilised. Maybe there will be opportunities to allow players to go through that full recovery process and be eased back in with the team.",
      "\"As we have seen with some players in the past, players sometimes thrust interaction back onto the pitch earlier than they would have liked. But it will certainly be in the realms of that three-month period.",
      "\"Anything before then will be a bit of a bonus and if it does extend then United have that duty of care with a player with long-term goals. He is coming into a new environment, new methodologies, new tactics, different intensity of playing football so that transitional phase will take time and will impact, not necessarily the injury but when he will be integrated back into that first team squad and really push for minutes in that United starting XI.\"",

      "The clock is ticking towards 11pm on Friday night as Manchester United and fellow Premier League clubs continue to piece together transfer puzzles.",
      "United are gunning for one more first-team signing, and there could be as many as three departures sanctioned by Ineos before the window closes. Scott McTominay, Hannibal Mejbri and Jadon Sancho are being shoe-horned towards the door at Old Trafford, and Manuel Ugarte remains their top inbound target. United and PSG have held positive discussions over his proposed transfer, and there are a number of options still on the table.",
      "United could sign the 23-year-old in a deal similar to Sofyan Amrabat last summer. A loan first move with either an option or obligation to buy appears to be most likely unless McTominay leaves permanently.",
      "Napoli are in the market for him. As for Sancho, meanwhile, United and Italian outfit Juventus are set for talks on a possible switch as August 30 looms ever closer, with Hannibal generating interest from Burnley.",
      "As always, there are plenty of moving parts at play, especially surrounding Ugarte and what effect a departure for McTominay will have on the final stages of that long-standing pursuit. Ugarte has been on the radar for some time, as United seek cover and competition for Casemiro in their engine room.",
      "It's a move that will also allow Erik ten Hag to rotate Casemiro and the emerging Kobbie Mainoo more freely. But what might happen in a dream scenario between now and 11pm on Friday night?",
      "Permanent exits for Hannibal, McTominay and Sancho would seemingly cover any expenditure for Ugarte, while it could even give United extra wiggle room within the budget after deals for Noussair Mazraoui, Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee were struck up previously.",
      "A fourth sale - involving Christian Eriksen - might be just the ticket too and especially so if United can generate an interest from the lucrative Saudi Arabia market. In that scenario, there might well be enough scope to press ahead with a 'surprise' addition in attacking quarters - perhaps between Ivan Toney and Evan Ferguson.",
      "Both men are said to be on radar for Ineos and United were previously keeping tabs on Ferguson. Each will almost certainly command a £50million-plus fee if Brighton decide to play ball with Ferguson.",
      "Toney, meanwhile, is seemingly on his way to Saudi Arabia despite Premier League interest. Brentford are thought to be in the process of finalising a deal with Al-Ahli, worth a reported £325,000 per-week to the player.",

      "Ending the tribute, Beckham relayed Eriksson's final words to him: \"Thank you Sven, and in your last words to me: 'It will be OK'.\"",
      "Tributes from across the football world and beyond are flowing in remembrance of Eriksson, including words from Prince William who shared: \"Sad to hear about the passing of Sven-Goran Eriksson. I met him several times as England manager and was always struck by his charisma and passion for the game.",

      "It's been a busy summer at Old Trafford with the arrival of three new defenders, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui as well as a new striker in Joshua Zirkzee. Around £138million in transfer fees has been spent to strengthen Erik ten Hag's squad as new sporting director Dan Ashworth looks to transform how the club buys and sells players.",
      "It's too early to say whether Ashworth's work has had any effect and at least one more signing is set to be made before the window closes on August 30. Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte has agreed personal terms with United and the Reds are now close to a breakthrough with PSG.",
      "But one central problem remains which Ten Hag has yet to fix, two games into his third season at the club. United succumbed to defeat at the Amex Stadium from a late stoppage-time winner, scored by Brighton's Joao Pedro.",
      "It followed the late equaliser scored by Bernardo Silva at Wembley in the Community Shield against Manchester City. United went on to lose that fixture as well, on penalties.",
      "Since the start of Ten Hag's first season in charge back in 2022/23, United have lost more games to goals scored in the 90th minute or later than any other English top-flight side (six). It's a startling statistic considering that they had only lost two such matches in the first 30 Premier League campaigns combined.",
      "And with another concentration lapse on Saturday costing United yet again, questions have to be asked of both the manager and players as to why this keeps happening. Is Ten Hag making the right substitutions to see out a close game? Are the players doing enough to stay switched on?",
      "A combination of both is probably why this keeps happening. A lack of goals scored by United players is also a factor.",
      "So many games won by Ten Hag's team have been by a single-goal margin. With so many United results on a knife edge, it's no wonder that wins so quickly turn into draws and draws turn into defeats.",
      "It's an issue which another big summer of big spending hasn't solved. No one should panic at the club after one defeat and there were some positive signs.",
      "However, Ten Hag won't take United far if he and the players continue to make poor decisions at the same major moments which cost United so many results. Improvement takes time but it will remain Groundhog Day at Old Trafford until United's major flaw is fixed.",

      "Jadon Sancho made the trip to the south coast on Saturday but was not in the squad.",
      "Sancho was left out of the Manchester United squad for a successive game and watched from the stands as his teammates lost at the Amex Stadium. The decision to omit him from the 20-man squad was ruthless from Erik ten Hag and supporters have no sympathy with the winger's predicament.",
      "\"He's here. I had a choice to make and we had some issues,\" said Ten Hag pre-match. \"We need a full squad and he is one of them. He has to compete for his position and from game to game, we will have a look. In the squad, we need every position double because it's a long season.\"",
      "You would get any odds you liked on Sancho sticking around Old Trafford for the full 2024/25 campaign. Ten Hag was diplomatic when asked about him in pre-season, but the opening two games show his true feelings and the player is in talks to leave before deadline day.",
      "Although United have been looking to sell Sancho, there hasn't been a huge appetite from top sides to sign him, which isn't surprising given his profile and wages. With the transfer window closing on Friday, Juventus and Chelsea have emerged as possible destinations and United are hoping a deal can be struck, most likely with the Serie A side.",
      "Whether that happens remains to be seen. Ten Hag leaving Sancho out of two squads shows he'll only be included when necessary and he must depart to prevent another six months in the cold at Carrington. Sancho wants to leave and has no mention of United on his social media, so a departure is probable although it will be interesting to see how a deal would be structured.",
      "Chelsea have the cash to sign Sancho permanently, which is United's preference, but Juventus are cash strapped and a loan deal with an option or an obligation to sign him once the season has finished is more likely for the Serie A side.",
      "The possibility of Chelsea offering Raheem Sterling in a swap deal with Sancho has also been touted and that would be a huge story considering Sterling spent seven years with Manchester City, helping them to win several Premier League titles before relocating to London.",
      "Yet Juventus are understood to be the front-runners and will hold talks in the coming days to attempt to find a breakthrough in negotiations.",
      "The truth is Sancho has never looked suited to Premier League football and seems to be most effective when playing in Europe, where the play can be slower and more deliberate.",
      "Sancho's best performance in recent memory came against Paris Saint-Germain when he was on loan at Borussia Dortmund last season but he didn't sustain that level during his second stint in Germany.",
      "Nonetheless, a move for Sancho could be viewed as low risk for Juventus because of the potential upside attached. He is clearly still a talented player there and could be an excellent addition if Thiago Motta can coax improvement out of him.",
      "Unfortunately, United have only seen fleeting glimpses of Sancho's talent and his contribution of 12 goals in 83 appearances is a dire record. The close to £73million fee that United paid to sign Sancho felt like a potential bargain, but every goal from the winger has cost £6m without factoring in wages.",
      "If a permanent move to Juventus can eventually be agreed for Sancho, a fraction of that initial investment will be recovered - his time at United has been a disaster.",

Sofyan Ambrabat did not return to Old Trafford following his loan spell from Italian side Fiorentina last season, while Casemiro, Napoli target Scott McTominay and Christian Eriksen were all up for grabs as Ineos continued to mull over potential sales.",
      "As things stand, none of those players have left. However, they are set to be joined by Ugarte.",
      "In that scenario, Erik ten Hag and his backroom staff will have some thinking to do when it comes to his best side. Andre Onana, Lisandro Martinez, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are pretty much undroppable, while Luke Shaw and Rasmus Hojlund could argue the same as and when fit.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are close to that bracket, too, despite the latter being consigned to the substitutes bench against Fulham and Brighton. That leaves one or two question marks - at right-back, right centre-back and holding midfield - with Ugarte and Casemiro the two options there.",
      "There's not too much between Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui at right-back and both of them can operate at left-back anyway with Shaw still on the treatment table. At centre-back, it ought to be a matter of time before De Ligt breaks into the starting XI.",

The teenage defender was signed for over £50million from Lille in the biggest deal of the window so far for United, but only managed two appearances before suffering a damaging foot injury.",
      "The Frenchman underwent surgery over a fortnight ago and was ruled out for what is expected to be between eight to 12 weeks. Alongside Rasmus Hojlund, who also picked up a knock on the USA trip, United are without two of their star players.",
      "\"This is not the start I wanted, but that’s football…\" Yoro wrote on Instagram at the time. \"The operation went well. Thank you for your many messages of support [black heart emoji]. Now, time for patience and rehabilitation work. See you soon, stronger [first emoji]\".",
      "In his absence United have once more turned to Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans whilst Matthijs de Ligt was signed from Bayern Munich. The centre-backs were unable to get Erik ten Hag over the line on Saturday against Brighton though, with Joao Pedro scoring a late winner.",
      "Yoro will be keen to get back onto the pitch in order to help his teammates as quickly as possible but is likely to be out until at least the start of November, with the second international break of the season after the Leicester City trip offering a possible gap before his return.",
      "However, taking to social media once again, Yoro has posted a cryptic but seemingly positive message. Alongside an image of him walking out during the friendly against Rangers in July, Yoro simply added a timer emoji.",

      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",

      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",

There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",

Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution.

In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United's flight back from Brighton was delayed by two hours on Saturday. Their season is yet to take off.",
      "There are three glaring issues with United: their attackers don't score, there midfield is nigh-on non-existent and their defenders cannot see out games. Joao Pedro's header was the seventh added-time winner United have conceded under Erik ten Hag.",
      "They have also suffered draws that felt like a defeat against Crystal Palace, Sevilla, Brentford and Coventry City. Ten Hag bristled at the suggestion their game management was inept.",
      "\"I think we also often did the right things,\" he stated, \"that we often had success. For instance, when we win the trophies and there were many other big games we take the points. On this occasion today we should do better.",
      "\"On many occasions we have done very good in situations where we brought the score over the line and take the result.\"",
      "Ten Hag dined alone in Hale on Sunday. Even with a teeming brains trust in the dugout to support him he will have felt lonely in the technical area in the 95th minute at Brighton.",
      "His in-game management brought upon United's collapse. Replacing Bruno Fernandes for Scott McTominay when the United captain's influence was growing was illogical and so was the unenforced withdrawal of Harry Maguire for Matthijs de Ligt. It is an unwritten rule in management not to disrupt your back four in-game. Antony's sole impact was to concede a cynical foul.",
      "McTominay was the right substitute for the wrong man. Kobbie Mainoo has looked weary since his return and Casemiro is on his last legs. Somehow, both midfielders saw out a game where United's midfield was second-best.",
      "\"That (conceding in added time)'s very disappointing, yeah,\" Ten Hag admitted. \"Because in the Community Shield we concede just before time, we should be more clinical in such situations, read the game, take the point if you can't win any more. We were close to winning this game but definitely don't lose the game.\"",
      "Sending McTominay on suggested it was win-or-bust. McTominay is nicknamed 'McTerminator' and his function is akin to Arnold Schwarzenegger's robotic responses: score goal, kick ball, head ball or tackle.",
      "McTominay is one of the tallest and most physical athletes in the United squad yet he shrank when Simon Adingra's cross found the unmarked Pedro. With a completely different attacking quartet on for the end of the match, United were disorganised and led by temporary captain Casemiro, whose English is limited.",
      "Despite one win from three games, United are a more competent and composed team in possession with 'game model' the new buzz phrase. Their approach play was encouraging again and they have created nine good or great chances without converting any of them in their matches this month.",
      "They are second in the expected goals table. One does not require such pseudo-intellectual standings to know United have been creative in the final third and one hopes Ten Hag does not refer to it at Carrington on Thursday. Coming second in it will not secure Champions League qualification next year.",
      "United's profligacy boils down to the absence of a dependable and proven goalscorer. They have taken a risk in investing more than £108.5million in two strikers at an identical age and with identically modest goalscoring records in Italy. Joshua Zirkzee will think twice about sliding towards goal when the ball is out of reach in the future.",
      "It was barely a footnote, but Mason Mount had his best and most meaningful half for United in Hove. The extent of Mount's \"issue\" that forced him off at half-time is yet to be established but after his laudable work off the ball against Fulham he was also effective on it at Brighton. That work ethic and willingness to lead the charge was evident when he penned in Jan Paul van Hecke and immediately beckoned his teammates up the pitch.",
      "United do not currently have that urgency in the middle third. Mainoo is more conductor than destructor. He favours playing with Casemiro yet Ten Hag started phasing him out with his FA Cup final demotion.",
      "Only the United hierarchy are taking until the final week of the transfer window to bring in a replacement. Manuel Ugarte is, unlike Mount, an out-and-out central midfielder and would bring impetus to an area where one midfielder has his bags packed, another is going next year and another may follow him out. Christian Eriksen warmed up at Brighton but is still out in the cold.",

      "United have stressed they would only be prepared to do deals that would aid their profitability and sustainability calculations for next year. United also have two wingers on the right and left-hand sides, with Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount also options on the right.",
      "Chelsea want to sell Sterling after he was left out of their opening game of the season against Manchester City. The winger's representatives published a statement before kick-off seeking \"clarity\" on his role and Sterling is now training away from the first team squad.",
      "Sterling grew up supporting United and has remarkably never scored against them in 26 appearances for Liverpool, City and Chelsea.",
      "United have no plans to move for Sterling's fellow Chelsea outcast, Ben Chilwell. Chelsea want to sell the left back and United are currently devoid of their senior left backs, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia, due to injury.",
      "Right back Diogo Dalot has started the season at left back and new signing Noussair Mazraoui is also able to play there. Seventeen-year-old left back Harry Amass was promoted to the first team squad after his impressive pre-season tour performances.",

      "Arsenal legend Ian Wright believes Manchester United's captain Bruno Fernandes was laughing at Erik ten Hag after being substituted in the defeat to Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "The Reds found themselves 1-0 down at the interval after Danny Welbeck tapped home from close range to give the hosts the lead. At half-time, it was clear something needed to change with Joshua Zirkzee being introduced to allow Fernandes to drop deeper into his preferred No.10 role.",
      "United's change had the desired effect on the hour mark as Amad's deflected strike brought the visitors level. Alejandro Garnacho thought he had made it 2-1 shortly afterwards but his goal was ruled out for offside after an agonising touch by the offside Zirkzee on the line.",
      "Instead of pushing for the winner in the final ten minutes, Ten Hag chose to try and consolidate the point as Scott McTominay was introduced for Fernandes. The Portuguese midfielder looked unimpressed by the decision as he left the field and ultimately it would backfire.",
      "Brighton won the game with the last chance of the game as Joao Pedro headed home unmarked at the back stick to win it for the Seagulls. Following the match, Wright told his podcast Wrighty’s House that he saw Fernandes do something that would likely unimpress his manager.",
      "\"A lot of things happened in that game that I just couldn’t understand or see happening,\" the former Match of the Day pundit said. \"Like I can’t understand why he took Bruno off and went so defensive.",

The 33-year-old conceded two goals, including a penalty, in the early minutes of the game as the Italian club were held to a 3-3 draw in a match they were deemed to be strong favourites.",

      "Fred opened the scoring from long-range on 15 minutes, while the 32-cap midfielder netted two more goals in the second half to take home the match-ball and lead Fenerbahce to victory. Edin Dzeko and Husniddin Aliqulov - who turned into his own net - gunned down sixth-placed Rizespor.",
      "It was an eventful game overall for Fred as his treble came after a fourth-minute booking. After leading the charge, the 31-year-old was taken off with 81 minutes on the clock to a standing ovation and, at that stage, the Portuguese made a beeline for his match-winner in the dugout.",

They play Venezia this evening and his involvement would expectedly confirm no move is on the cards to end months of speculation.",
      "MEN says: \"Although Amrabat impressed at times during his season-long spell at Old Trafford last season, United should avoid re-signing him this summer. With Ugarte set to arrive from Paris Saint-Germain, it remains to be seen whether United need to bring in another midfielder before the end of the window.",
      "\"And if they do decide to, they should look at bringing in someone younger and more athletic than Amrabat. That is no disrespect to the Moroccan, who can adequately do a steady job, but United are arguably light in the No.8 area with Ugarte and Casemiro as the two defensive midfielders at the club.\"",
      "United have reportedly identified Brazilian midfielder Andre as their main target if they fail to land Manuel Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain. Trivela claim that the delay in the deal to sign Ugarte have led United to consider alternative options, with Fluminense star Andre appearing as one of the others they could sign.",
      "They report that United have approached the 23-year-old's agent. Andre has been tipped to make the move to the Premier League after starring in Brazil over the past couple of years. He was linked with a move to Liverpool and Fulham earlier in the window as they tried to bolster their midfield.",
      "MEN says: \"It does look like Ugarte is going to make the switch to Old Trafford, but if a deal doesn't manage to get over the line, Andre is not a bad alternative that is for certain. The Brazil international is an excellent defensive midfielder who operates just in front of the back four.",

      "Hojlund missed his fair share of chances last season and he's still a raw striker, but he provides presence down the centre and enjoyed a purple patch at the beginning of 2024.",
      "The striker finished the campaign with 16 goals, which represented a strong return for his first season in England, and United should improve when he is available for selection again.",
      "It's sometimes a case of you don't know what you have until it's gone. There's no denying Hojlund has improvements to make and he must sharpen his finishing, but his qualities make United a better team and he would have made tests against Fulham and Brighton easier to overcome.",
      "Thankfully, United have to play just one more game (Liverpool) without Hojlund and fans will be hoping he hits the ground running after the September international break.",
      "United desperately need a goalscorer and Hojlund is their closest thing to that.",

      "\"Even if you go back to my time with Darren, I very seldom left him out of big games, particularly against Arsenal. He was fantastic against Arsenal and Vieira and I had no problems. McTominay is going forward on those guidelines that Darren pursued for a long time at United. It's really rewarding for me to see a Scot coming through.\"",

      "For now, with the second stage of the Erik ten Hag era still in its infancy, it's going to condition how we view this team. It's the prism through which United are being judged early in the campaign.",
      "And if the judgements on the opening weekend were encouraging, this was more of a concern. It wasn't quite the collapse we associated United with so often last season. For a lot of the afternoon, they were harder to play against, more structured and more controlled. But they can't kick the addiction to chaos.",
      "United conceded a soft opener in a dull first half and when the game opened up after the break they rode their luck before a 95th-minute winner that felt like it should have been gift-wrapped. Failing to clear a corner and then forgetting to defend half the penalty area during the second phase felt eerily familiar. It came at a time when Brighton's pressure had been building.",
      "So a point that would have felt like it added belief to Ten Hag's new side vanished and the familiar questions returned. This team do look better, but are the improvements enough? They have got better as a pressing team and are more compact, but they aren't creating enough chances and are making defensive errors. It puts plenty of pressure on the Old Trafford game with Liverpool next week.",

Brighton had won four of their last five Premier League meetings and in so many ways they are a club that United are now trying to ape under Ineos. They are United's bogey team but in so many ways their template as well.",

      "After an exodus of players from the Amex in recent years it has been a more stable summer and they have spent more than United on new arrivals. All of them are young players with obvious resale value and many of them creative signings. There are players coming in front Mainz, Nordsjaelland and Gothenburg.",
      "It's noticeable that under 31-year-old head coach Fabian Hurzeler they play a similar style to Roberto De Zerbi. The wingers still fly forward, there are still two strikers and they try to bait the press when deep.",

For too long they have lurched from one style to another, from one fad to the next. If either team deserved to win the game it was the Seagulls and in Hurzeler they seem to have another manager destined for the top.",
      "It will stick in Ten Hag's craw that he was beaten by a coach 23 years younger than him. He might have survived the summer but the pressure could easily increase early in the season and he has to avoid results like this.",
      "Sticking with him is the biggest gamble of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership. United are starting to get things right under Ineos and their summer transfer activity looks smart. They can't afford many more games like this.",

With Manchester United looking for strikers in the summer transfer window, the 28-year-old was inevitably linked with a switch to Old Trafford.",

Last weekend, Toney missed out on the Brentford team that beat Crystal Palace and he was not named in the squad at Anfield on Sunday.",

It will be a brutal decision due to his status at the club and being among the best-paid players in the squad - and his past performances against Liverpool - plus the fact that it is likely too late for Rashford to secure a move away, but it is one Ten Hag may have to make based on current form.",

      "He featured for the club’s U16, U18, and U21 sides last season, winning the Goal of the Season award at both U16 and U18 levels. He made nine appearances for the U18s, his goal being a crucial equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Derby County.",

That's what also drew me to the club, the potential we have in the next few years. I want to help the club and I want to do it together with the girls.\"",
      "Last season was a disappointing one for United as they finished fifth in the WSL, winning just 10 of their 22 league games.

      "The 21-year-old joined the Reds from Everton in 2022 though she is yet to make a competitive appearance for the club, having since enjoyed loan spells at both Bristol City and Tottenham Hotspur. Clinton excelled for the latter last term, scoring four goals and assisting four others in 20 Women's Super League (WSL) appearances and playing an integral role in Spurs’ charge to their first ever Women’s FA Cup final, though she was ineligible to play against her parent club and eventual victors United at Wembley.",
      "Her impressive form saw her receive her first senior England call up earlier this year. She made her first full start against Austria after two appearances off the bench, and duly made an impact with her first international goal in a 7-2 win for the Lionesses.",
      "Clinton impressed so much at Tottenham that the club were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" manager Robert Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "However United boss Skinner has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester. \"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" he said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "And Clinton has now voiced her commitment to the Reds, insisting her ambition is to add more silverware to the club's collection. \"To go to Tottenham and get confidence was just amazing,\" she said at the start-studded awards ceremony on Tuesday night. \"And to improve obviously personally. The aim is always to win trophies with Manchester United.\"",
      "On her award, Clinton added: “It’s such an honour to be voted by the unbelievable players that play in this league. It’s the best league in the world. “To go out on loan, learning as a young player and being recognized is lovely. I’ve played with confidence and when you play with that then you see the best version of a player. Tottenham have been a massive part of my journey, and I can’t thank them enough. Goals and visualisation are important to me but most of all just enjoying playing. If I’m enjoying myself then I play my best football.”",
      "Clinton also featured in the PFA Women's Team of the Year, alongside Manchester City stars Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw, Yui Hasegawa, Lauren Hemp, Khiara Keating, Alex Greenwood, Laia Aleixandri. She beat out a host of talented players to earn the award with Lauren James, Aggie Beever-Jones, Khiara Keating, Maya Le Tissier and Jess Park among the names on the Top Six shortlist.",

      "With a deft back-post finish, Lizzie Arnot wrote her name into the annals of Manchester United history. The date was August 19, 2018 and the Scotland international ensured the Reds' long-awaited renaissance began in style by netting a last-gasp winner against bitter rivals Liverpool in the League Cup.",
      "The setting - in front of just 829 fans at an overcast Prenton Park - belied the enormity of the occassion. This was United's first competitive game in 13 years, their first competitive outing since the Glazer regime opted to disband their senior women's team after deeming it not to be part of the club's \"core business\".",
      "The team was peppered with familar faces. Alex Greenwood, now captain of Manchester City, teed up Arnot to score the winner. Lauren James, who returned to childhood club Chelsea for what was - in 2021 - a British record fee, started in midfield, while current United stars Ella Toone, Millie Turner and Leah Galton also featured.",
      "\"For a team that has only been together for six weeks they weathered the storm quite well,\" manager Casey Stoney told BBC Radio 5 Live after the game.",
      "\"I recruited from the second tier, they've stepped up and shown they are more than capable of playing a level above that. There's no pressure from the club to get promotion but these players want to be playing in the top flight. They're history makers now.\"",
      "In spite of Stoney's measured assessment of United's ambitions, the Reds did achieve promotion at the first time of asking, subsequently finishing fourth in their first season in the Women's Super League (WSL). And now, just six years on from that League Cup victory over Liverpool, United are a card-carrying member of the top flight's elite.",
      "Stoney's departure in the summer of 2021 was a blow but her replacement, former Birmingham City boss Marc Skinner, has presided over the most successful period in the club's history. In 2022/23, the Reds took the title race to the final day, posting a club-record points tally in the process while also reaching the FA Cup final.",
      "Last term, despite a disappointing fifth-place finish in the WSL, United beat Tottenham Hotspur to the FA Cup trophy; a reality which would have seemed inconceivable on that momentous afternoon at Prenton Park more than half a decade ago.",
      "While the Reds have come a tremendously long way since then, it is fair to say this summer has not been without its challenges. First came the revelataion that Skinner had been handed a one-year contract extension - a decision which was not universally popular with the United fanbase.",
      "Then came the exodus of some of the club's biggest stars. England goalkeeper Mary Earps left to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), citing United's transitional state and her own ambition to compete for more silverware as her chief motivating factors. Club captain Katie Zelem also departed on a free transfer, as did fan-favourite striker Lucia Garcia.",
      "All of this unfolded has against the backdrop of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's barely concealed apathy towards Skinner's side. The INEOS chief gave a tone-deaf interview to Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "This was swiftly followed by United Women being ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp, though it is understood Skinner and his players will still have access to all the necessary facilities.",
      "Still, the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United have been concerning.",
      "That said, the Reds have recruited shrewdly in the transfer market, with the acquisition of Brighton & Hove Albion striker Elisabeth Terland and Swedish defender Anna Sandberg, in particular, inspiring excitement, while the appointment of Dan Ashworth as sporting director inspires hope of tangible change at the club.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said in an open letter to supporters last month.",
      "\"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "Indeed, six years on from that win over Liverpool, United now have all the ingredients in place to be truly successful. The Reds may already have made history in the years since their reformation but, with the WSL set to be more competitive than ever next term, it is clear the hard work is only just beginning.",

      "Dan Ashworth has met with Manchester United Women's players after a turbulent summer for Marc Skinner's side.",
      "United have come in for criticism of late number after a number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, were allowed to leave the club on free transfers, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway.",
      "However, Ashworth's long-awaited arrival from Newcastle United last month has offered some cause for optimism, with the sporting director having previously been a huge advocate for the growth of the women's game during his time with the Magpies and in his previous role at Brighton & Hove Albion. And the 53-year-old has now met with Skinner and his players as they ramp up their pre-season preparations at St George's Park.",
      "Pictures shared on the club's website show Ashworth giving a speech to the women's first-team squad and shaking hands with stars such as Ella Toone and Millie Turner. This comes after he outlined his vision for the Reds in an open letter to supporters.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said last month. \"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United.",

      "The 20-year-old midfielder joins the Reds from the United States collegiate system, where she represented the University of Southern California’s USC Trojans. Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber. The Reds finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last term and won the Women's FA Cup. They will get their new campaign underway against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday, September 22.",
