      "Olly Murs had the Liverpool crowd eating out of the palm of his hand during a performance at the M&S Bank Arena earlier this week. The 41-year-old chart sensation took his 15 Years Of Hits tour to the docks on Thursday.",
      "After a solid fifteen years since Murs first stepped into the public eye with an X Factor audition that left the nation in awe, he was seen delivering smooth vocals on a rendition of Stevie Wonder's Superstition. From his days winning the hearts of judges and viewers alike, Olly still commands a loyal following.",
      "A sea of the Murs Army filled the Bank Arena as the singer-songwriter commemorated his time in music with a high-spirited country-wide tour. With a repertoire spanning 15 years, it would be simple for Murs to let his well-loved tunes speak for themselves.",
      "At one point in the show, Olly invited his band to \"embarrass\" him, by projecting an unknown picture in front of the crowd. He told fans: \"On this part of the show, I have absolutely no idea what is about to appear on that screen\", reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "His Scouse fans watched on as a photo of Olly touching Liverpool FC's famous This Is Anfield sign prompted a split reaction, as cheers from Liverpool FC fans clashed with boos from Everton supporters. But, Olly swiftly brought all sides together when he disclosed that his loyalties actually lie down the M62, admitting: \"Of course, this will probably get the biggest boo of the night. I am a Manchester United fan.\"",
      "To a cacophony of jesting boos, a chuckling Olly then playfully suggested: \"Shall I go?\" But the audience clearly wasn't keen on ending the night there – they cheered for him to carry on, leading him into another chart-topping track.",
      "Olly kicked his hit-filled setlist with Troublemaker, serenading them through two hours of his best known songs. The pop sensation turned 41 this Wednesday and marked the occasion by belting out a medley of 80s classics, celebrating the era of his birth.",
      "Having come a long way from his days as a cover singer, Olly had fans ecstatic to hear original hits including Heart Skips a Beat and Wrapped Up, alongside the timeless tunes. The gig took an emotional turn when Olly performed Dear Darling.",
      "The poignant track was dedicated to his late friend and X Factor co-presenter, Caroline Flack. Sharing with the audience, he confessed: \"I genuinely think about her every day.\"",
      "He continued: \"I know that feeling of losing someone that you love very much. With this song, I want you to think of those people and sing with me.\"",
      "As thousands of phones illuminated the arena, fans joined in an unforgettable rendition of the 2012 ballad, creating the night's most memorable moment. While this tour marked his 15-year journey in the music industry, Olly gave his fans a sneak peek into his future plans. He performed his new single, 'Save Me', exclusively for the audience, hinting at what's next for him.",
      "Describing the song as the beginning of a \"new Murs era\", it's clear from the crowd's reaction that they're excited about what lies ahead. As he exited the stage to thunderous applause, it's evident that his fans are eagerly anticipating more milestones from Olly, who has firmly established himself as a top-notch performer.",

      "Manchester City players' discussions of an Ibiza holiday prior to the 2024 FA Cup final allegedly lit a fire under Manchester United to win the spectacle last season. That's according to ex-United coach Benni McCarthy, who served as an assistant under Erik ten Hag from 2022 until last summer.",
      "The Manchester derby was on the Wembley stage last season, with Pep Guardiola gunning for the opportunity to claim a Premier League and cup double.",
      "It was also a chance for Ten Hag to earn a trophy for the second consecutive season at Old Trafford, which he achieved with a surprising 2-1 victory.",
      "While City were the overwhelming favourites, considering they recently celebrated an unprecedented fourth league title in a row while finishing 31 points ahead of their city rivals, a pre-match moment among Guardiola's men left the United squad motivated to complete the seemingly improbable task.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Ladbrokes at the launch of Gaffer of all Accas earlier this year, McCarthy said: \"When we went to walk and inspect the pitch, at that moment, the disrespect from the City players kind of played a huge part.",
      "\"You know, when you stand there and you see the players, all little groups of friends here and there, the players are out on the pitch and soaking up the atmosphere. When we walked back towards the dressing room, a lot of the City players were discussing their trips to Ibiza after the game.",
      "\"So in their heads, they've already won the FA Cup and they're already thinking about going to Ibiza and that. I think that kind of infuriated our boys because, mate, we'd got a final to win.",
      "\"We have a final to play, and you lot are talking about your after-party! Almost like in terms of they've already won it, and they are preparing the celebrations for it like they're playing against no opposition. When we got into the dressing room, the players were like, 'These lot are disrespecting us'.",
      "\"So then they, amongst themselves, had a little huddle, and in the huddle they were going at it about the disrespect, you know. I think that's probably what we needed at that time. It just brought the furious side out of us.\"",
      "A year later, City find themselves in their third FA Cup final in a row on Saturday with Crystal Palace standing in their way of ending what has been a disappointing season with a trophy.",
      "Despite a dismal campaign for United, who are resigned to finishing no higher than 13th this season, they can also claim silverware as they take on Tottenham in the Europa League final on Wednesday."

      "Fair play to the very likeable Ruben Amorim for trying to put some sort of positive spin on another Premier League defeat, Manchester United’s 18th of the season. “This performance has helped me a lot to choose the starting 11 for the (Europa League) final,” he said, with a touch of grim humour, no doubt.",
      "And his team selection for the loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge suggested there were one or two players on trial for Bilbao, most notably Mason Mount, who must be under consideration for a starting role against Spurs in Spain. Other players ‘on trial’ must have included Rasmus Hojlund but his trial is a long-running affair.",
      "When you hear the likes of Roy Keane laying into the Danish striker, it is hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for Hojlund. The centre-piece of Keane’s dismantling of the United striker came when he said Hojlund “looked like he had just come out of the academy.”",
      "Brutal. And there is no escaping the startling ineffectiveness of a forward who cost in excess of £70million and only looks as though he is going to score if one hits him and goes in, as it did against Athletic Bilbao recently.",
      "But even if Hojlund appears to have a particularly thick skin, it is tough to see a pile-on, and it might be in the player’s interests to look for an extended spell on loan in Europe next season, to rebuild his confidence. Let’s face it, no-one is going to pay big money for a permanent transfer.",
      "In the meantime, Amorim has a big decision to make, the sort of big decision managers are paid the big bucks for. As the alternatives are very limited, it would seem likely that Hojlund will start, especially as he has been a feature of the run to the final.",
      "But, essentially, on Wednesday, it is a Premier League match, albeit one against a Premier League team that is actually worse than United. And Hojlund is showing nothing that suggests he can hurt Spurs.",
      "Would it be a big call to leave Hojlund out? Not really. Probably not even as big as when Pep Guardiola left Kyle Walker out of the 2023 Champions League final.",
      "Immediately after the loss at Chelsea, there were United fans on social media suggesting Harry Maguire would be a more viable starting option upfront. Maguire will be needed at the back but, such are Hojlund’s struggles, you take the point. And an elite manager is paid to come up with different strategies. Starting Kobbie Mainoo - who seems to have a keener eye for goal than Hojlund - as a false nine would be one.",
      "Wednesday’s final might actually be more significant for Ange Postecoglou than it is for Amorim, who stays at United regardless. But it will still tell us a lot about Amorim and his willingness to make the big, bold decision. It will still tell us a lot about whether Amorim is truly the man for the job."

      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery joked that he expected Manchester United to be beaten by Chelsea on Friday night. Marc Cucurella netted the decisive goal for the Blues late in the second half, heading past Andre Onana and handing United their 18th Premier League loss of the season.",
      "United thought they had taken the lead when Harry Maguire found the back of the net from a Bruno Fernandes cross, but VAR ruled it out for offside. The match ended 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, with Enzo Maresca's Chelsea taking a significant step towards securing Champions League qualification for next season.",
      "Villa are another of the teams in the race to secure a top-five finish, which will see them return to Europe's top competition. And had Amorim's side got a result in West London, Villa's destiny would have been in their own hands.",
      "Emery hinted that he hadn't held out too much hope of that happening, though, with Villa now needing results to go in their favour on the final day.",
      "\"How's it going with Chelsea? ,\" he asked. \"Finished 1-0, okay we expected it\" he said, followed by a cheeky grin and a laugh.",
      "Emery added: \"It's not in our hands. We are winning. But other teams are as well, they are being demanding, and they are getting their points.\"",
      "As for United, they can, somehow, still earn a place in the Champions League, despite being on for their worst domestic finish in more than 50 years. Defeat against Chelsea leaves them in 16th place in the table, but winning the Europa League final vs Spurs would see them return to Europe's elite.",
      "Amorim is not sure that would be beneficial for United's long-term success though, with a huge overhaul of the playing staff required to compete.",
      "Asked if Champions League qualification could hinder his project, he said: “That is my feeling. We need more time with the team. We need to arrange a lot of things in Carrington that we need more time to do, so we’re not thinking game by game by game.",
      "“Then we have the squad. We proved this year that we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and then be really competitive in the Premier League. That is going to be tough. My feeling is that.\""

      "The goal came about after neat play from Chelsea saw the play switched from left to right. The ball ended up with Blues skipper Reece James on the edge of the box, with Garnacho marking him.",
      "James pulled off a piroutte, leaving Garnacho in his wake, before digging out a cross towards the far post. That was where an unmarked Marc Cucurella was waiting to head the ball past Andre Onana.",
      "That proved to be the only goal of the game, with United failing to deliver much in terms of an attacking threat. Garnacho had only just come on in place of Mason Mount and quickly found himself at the ire of his team-mates.",
      "Both Fernandes and Maguire were spotted angrily gesturing to Garnacho after Cucurella's goal. It was the latest low point in what has been a miserable season for the Argentine winger.",
      "He has found himself out of favour since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as manager. This was his second successive Premier League game starting on the bench, having only played 30 minutes in the defeat to West Ham.",
      "It means Garnacho is highly unlikely to start next week's Europa League final against Tottenham. And legendary United skipper Roy Keane has urged Amorim to move on from Garnacho, as well as fellow academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo and striker Rasmus Hojlund.",

      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers. The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.\""

      "Casemiro has offered an honest reflection of Manchester United’s historically worst season by admitting “we need to think bigger”. The 2024/25 season has undoubtedly been the Red Devils’ worst ever season in the Premier League era, with a number of unwanted records set.",
      "Despite a shock FA Cup final victory over Manchester City to end last term, the new campaign quickly descended into chaos under former boss Erik ten Hag, who was sacked in October following a disastrous run of results.",
      "The appointment of Ruben Amorim as his successor has failed to improve the team's fortunes, with the players struggling to adapt to the Portuguese coach's tactics. That puts them all the way down in 16th place in the league on just 39 points, with one game to go following Friday’s 1-0 defeat to Chelsea, meaning they are set for comfortably their worst Premier League finish ever.",
      "United's domestic cup campaigns have also ended in disappointment, with defeats to Fulham in the FA Cup and Tottenham in the Carabao Cup. Yet, the Red Devils still have a chance to salvage some pride and secure a Champions League spot for next season by winning the Europa League final against Tottenham on May 21.",
      "United demolished Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, and a victory over Spurs would provide a rare positive in an otherwise dismal season. Now, United’s 33-year-old midfielder Casemiro has spoken about wanting to “give everything” to win the final.",
      "He also provided a damning verdict on the rest of the season, noting how a club of United’s stature must do better in the league and in cup competitions. Speaking to Telemundo Deportes before the defeat to Chelsea, the Brazilian said: “I always say that the final part is always the most beautiful and the most important.",
      "“We know that in the Premier League, it didn't go as we had hoped. Well, we have a great opportunity against Tottenham to bring happiness and joy not only to ourselves but also to the club and the fans. That is very important.",
      "“But we know that the season, regarding matches, was not good, especially for a club like Manchester United. Here, we always expect titles and to be at the top of the table. But we have a very good opportunity and a very nice challenge to win a title and have a bit of happiness at the end of the season.”",
      "Asked why United’s season has been so poor, the five-time Champions League winner said: “We've had many ups and downs. We changed managers and then systems. It's true that in the last five or six matches we were completely focused on the Europa League.",
      "“But of course, when it comes to Manchester United, you need to win and be at the top of the table. There are no excuses. So next season, we need to be stronger; above all, we need to win more matches and earn more points. When it comes to Manchester United, we always have to think about titles and winning.”",
      "And when asked whether winning the Europa League will rescue their season, Casemiro replied: \"Well, it's difficult to talk about whether it saves it or not. In the end, what does saving mean? What does winning mean? Everyone sees it differently.",
      "“In my opinion, it's certainly a joy because winning means we play in the Champions League next year. It won't be easy to win, but it will be a very nice opportunity.",
      "“It's true that in terms of numbers and results, this season wasn't good. But we have a very nice opportunity to play in the Champions League next year and have another chance at European competition.",
      "“It's very difficult to say if it saves the season or if the season was good or not; every person has a different opinion. For me, it wasn't good, and we need to be higher up in the table. We need to think bigger when it comes to Manchester United.”",
      "He went on to add: “I think it will be a very beautiful final. We have great respect for Tottenham. We know they are playing for something similar to us and we want to give everything to win that match.”",
      "The Brazil international, who joined United for £60million in August 2022, made a huge impact in his debut season but found his second campaign more challenging as he appeared to struggle with the pace of the Premier League.",
      "This season has been a mixed bag for the defensive midfielder, who has been used sparingly in the league by Amorim with 23 appearances. However, Casemiro continues to be a key player in Europe, playing most of the minutes across United's six knockout matches, setting up three goals against Lyon and netting twice against Athletic Club."

      "The record was set by a poor defeat to Chelsea on Friday night. To make matters worse, United were playing in front of controlling co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who was in the stands at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Amorim had named a strong side for the trip to the capital, somewhat surprisingly ahead of next week's Europa League final. But the visitors were blunt in attack and offered little of note.",
      "The Blues secured all three points thanks to a late header from Marc Cucurella. The Spanish left-back lost his marker to powerfully head home an excellent cross from captain Reece James.",
      "The defeat leaves United down in 16th place, 27 points behind fifth place Aston Villa and a giagantic 44 adrift of champions Liverpool. It also means that Amorim has set a fresh mark among United's worst-ever managers.",
      "The loss at Stamford Bridge was their 18th league defeat, their most in a season since losing 20 in the 1973/1974 campaign when they were relegated. United have also now gone eight league games without a win, a club record in the Premier League.",
      "It is their worst run since an 11-game winless run between December 1989 and February 1990. The run started with a defeat at Nottingham Forest, before a draw with Manchester City and a hammering at Newcastle.",
      "They were then beaten by struggling Wolves before being held by 10-man Bournemouth. Their last three games have all ended in defeat, against Brentford, West Ham and now Chelsea.",
      "It is Amorim's second run of losing three successive Premier League matches with United. He also achieved the awful feat in December. That is one only one fewer run of three consecutive defeats than Sir Alex Ferguson had across his 810 games in the competition.",
      "More concerningly for Ratcliffe is the fact that since the start of April, United have won fewer points than any other Premier League side, drawing two and losing six of eight games in that time.",
      "In a clear sign where their make weakness lies, the Red Devils have now failed to score in the first half of 26 Premier League matches this season, their most-ever in a single campaign. Indeed, no side has failed to score in more first halves this season.",
      "\"You can forgive teams for losing, but when the manager is coming up most weeks and is scratching his head. Amorim's head is spinning from being Man Utd manager. I get why he thought: I didn't want to get into that mess [until the summer].",
      "\"He will be glad to see the back of this season. Some of the games, they have just written off. I've never heard so much chat from this club about next week's game. Don't think for one minute that this team is going to be top four or top five.",
      "\"They've lost 17 games this season, but they lost 14 last year. It's not just this season. This team just doesn't know how to compete. This is the bit I don't get. Turning up week in week out is the sign of greatness. And these players? Every week they don't know how to compete.\""

      "It will go right to the wire. But Chelsea have got their Champions League fate back in their own hands after a topsy turvy night at Stamford Bridge. Marc Cucurella was the unlikely hero with a 71st minute winner to push Chelsea back up to fourth and to leave European qualification on a knife edge.",
      "It was Cucurella’s fifth goal of the season and yet this could be his most precious of all with a prize of playing on Europe’s biggest stage at stake.",
      "They now have to go to Nottingham Forest on the final day knowing that victory will put them in next season’s Champions League. It was a rollercoaster because Chelsea do look like a bag of nerves and struggled to break down Manchester United’s stubborn resistance.",
      "United of course still have the Europa League final and a passport into the Champions League if they can beat Tottenham in Bilbao in five days’ time. This was hardly great preparation for United because it is now eight Premier League games without a win for Ruben Amorim’s men.",
      "But they have put all their eggs in the Champions League basket even if they really went for it at Stamford Bridge as Amorim clearly wants his players fresh and fired up rather than rested. You also cannot fault the Manchester United fans for their unwavering support and belief.",
      "The travelling faithful chanted Ruben Amorim’s name with their now familiar song about the United boss bringing back the glory days and turning the club around.",
      "On this evidence, Amorim will also need to be a miracle worker because, despite a bright start in both halves, they do look an unruly rabble lacking in direction.",
      "United were near full strength and thought they had gone ahead after 15 minutes when Bruno Fernandes whipped a brilliant, teasing ball into the box, Harry Maguire steered it into the net but VAR intervened to give the tightest of offside decisions.",
      "It was fast and furious as Reece James’ brilliant 20 yard drive hit the outside of the post with United keeper Andre Onana beaten all ends up.",
      "The home fans were booing United’s ex-Chelsea star Mason Mount’s every touch after his defection to Old Trafford two years ago and they were giving their own keeper similar treatment.",
      "Mount missed a big chance and Chelsea were far from in charge as the away fans cheered their men on. Chelsea fans are getting restless and even Cole Palmer could not break the deadlock when his curling 20 yard shot was saved by Andre Onana.",
      "United had almighty scare when referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot after Onana appeared to upend Chelsea youngster Tyrique George but VAR overturned it.",
      "Chelsea were getting desperate - and then Cucurella stepped up. With England boss Thomas Tuchel looking on, James turned and created some space on the edge of the box. James’ floated cross found Cucurella headed into the far corner for a brilliant and priceless winner.",
      "Noni Madueke missed a big chance to make it 2-0 and settle nerves but you get the feeling that this will be a nail biting finish to the season no matter what. At least now Chelsea have their fate in their own hands."

      "The game came alive after the break, with both teams seeing penalty shouts waved away by referee Chris Kavanagh. But Cucurella proved to be the hero, powering a header past Andre Onana from Reece James' cross.",

      "Win in Bilbao and United will qualify for the Champions League. While Amorim may be focusing on keeping his side match sharp, it was a puzzling choice to include so many top stars. His side may even suffer a hit to their vulnerable morale having slipped to an 18th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Moises Caicedo was a surprising absentee from the shortlist for the Premier League's Player of the Year award. The midfielder has been a driving force behind the Blues' push for Champions League qualification this season.",
      "But Ryan Gravenberch, Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Declan Rice, Alexander Isak, Bryan Mbeumo, Chris Wood and Morgan Gibbs-White were instead the eight men selected to battle it out.",
      "Caicedo showed up whoever left his name off the list in style, running the show from midfield. He completed 94 percent of his passes, made seven recoveries and won five of his defensive duels.",
      "Young players from both Chelsea and United have clearly been picking up some bad habits. First, Blues starlet Tyrique George threw himself to the ground while trying to round Andre Onana.",
      "Referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot, but he overturned his decision after replays showed Onana had got the ball and George was falling before being touched. Minutes later United star Amad earned a place in Kavanagh's bad books.",
      "The winger went down in the box while trying to slalom past a number of Chelsea defenders. Kavanagh booked the United man with replays showing he had not been touched.",
      "Just when the game appeared to be petering out into a bore draw, Marc Cucurella popped up to rescue Chelsea's season. The left-back pulled away from his marker Noussair Mazraoui to find space in the United box.",
      "He then leapt high before powering in Reece James' cross with a brilliant header. The ball flew past Andre Onana and into the net, with Cucurella racing away to celebrate.",
      "It was a goal that could prove to be crucial to Chelsea's hopes of claiming Champions League qualification. And it continues Cucurella's run of only scoring in Premier League wins this season."

      "It was a little more than 12 months ago that Ten Hag was all but set to record United's first victory at Stamford Bridge in more than four years. Two Alejandro Garnacho goals either side of a Bruno Fernandes finish put the visitors 3-2 up when officials announced eight minutes of added time, which led to an incensed reaction from Ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman's disappointment deepened when Cole Palmer netted twice in the 100th and 101st minutes to give the Blues a dramatic 4-3 win. United left west London with their tails between their legs, and Ten Hag made his displeasure clear by darting down the tunnel at full time without shaking then-Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino's hand.",
      "Both clubs have seen significant change since then, with Amorim now at the United helm and Enzo Maresca in charge of Chelsea. Yet despite this transition, little has improved for United in the 14 months or so since that match.",
      "United are due to clash against Tottenham in the Europa League final next Wednesday, providing an opportunity to redeem their historically poor campaign. Nevertheless, there's a debate whether even victory in Bilbao can cast Amorim's first half-year at the helm in a more positive light.",
      "United's recent 2-0 home defeat to West Ham was yet another indication things are far from rosy at Old Trafford. This season has seen the club suffer nine home defeats in the league; only four other teams have suffered more, three of whom have been relegated.",
      "The Red Devils' vulnerability was on show when they surrendered an early lead in a dramatic 4-3 defeat to Brentford earlier in May. Similar opportunities to secure wins against teams like Arsenal, Lyon, and Liverpool have slipped through their fingers in recent months, evidence of a worrying trend towards fragility in the team.",
      "When asked how it feels to be languishing in 16th with just two games to go, Amorim said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept. I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here.",
      "\"Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club. We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "The former Sporting CP boss might not be anticipating any miracles at Stamford Bridge despite some impressive performances away from home this season. And Amorim would be hard-pressed to give a more disappointing response than his predecessor should things not go United's way once more."

      "Despite witnessing Erik ten Hag squander a 3-2 lead against Chelsea last season, Sir Jim Ratcliffe opted to keep faith in the Dutch manager.",
      "The INEOS boss, who secured a stake in Manchester United in February 2024, was seen with a stony expression at Stamford Bridge during a Premier League clash last April. With the Red Devils undergoing a rather uninspiring season, and Ten Hag's capacity to deliver results coming under close inspection, the defeat could have been pivotal in deciding his future amid new investment-led restructuring.",
      "United let their advantage gained from Alejandro Garnacho's double and a Bruno Fernandes effort slip late into stoppage time when Cole Palmer netted a penalty before scoring again a minute later to snatch victory for Chelsea in dramatic fashion.",
      "Many supporters might have presumed Ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford was doomed, especially after United ended the season at an all-time low eighth position in the Premier League, but grasping the FA Cup title at the expense of local rivals Manchester City potentially postponed any immediate managerial changes.",
      "Even so, Ten Hag would have felt the heat, particularly considering the comments of Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff upon Ratcliffe's entry, noting that he and INEOS, who own a share of the Formula 1 team, favour a no-nonsense approach. Wolff said: \"This is a no bull**** organisation.",
      "\"They are huge in terms of revenue and profit. Decisions are being made quickly – three bullet points on a page and 'here we go.' With Jim, all the bull**** is cut out.\"",
      "In a candid interview with Belgian newspaper De Tijd last February, Ratcliffe also shared his vision for Manchester United, saying: \"We have to look at the organisation of the club, because it is not good at the moment. Take the head coach, for example: he must report directly to the CEO. That is no longer possible in a modern football organisation. We have to ensure that the right people end up in the right positions.",
      "\"Every person in management must be world-class. And then it is important to create a positive, supportive, friendly and high-quality environment. That culture was missing before. Only in such an environment can you get the best out of sportsmen. If successful, the results will follow automatically. That's the plan, and I believe in it.\"",
      "Despite a less-than-stellar season and whispers of Gareth Southgate and Zinedine Zidane potentially taking over at Old Trafford, Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy gave their support to Ten Hag for the 2024/25 campaign. They extended his contract until June 2026 and provided him with a substantial transfer kitty to enhance his team.",
      "Despite reportedly shelling out £36.5million for Joshua Zirkzee, £42m for Manuel Ugarte, £52m for Leny Yoro, £49.2m for Matthijs de Ligt, and £17m for Noussair Mazraoui, Ten Hag couldn't turn things around at the start of the current season - managing just three wins in his first nine matches before being given the boot following a 2-1 defeat by West Ham in October. He was succeeded by Ruben Amorim the following month.",
      "Fast forward to May 2025, and Ratcliffe will certainly be keeping a close eye on his team this Friday evening, as they once again head to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. It's been a truly woeful season for the Red Devils that many supporters will be eager to put behind them, with the club currently languishing in 16th place in the league table with a mere 10 victories to their name.",
      "However, there is a glimmer of hope as United could still clinch the Europa League trophy, with a struggling Tottenham standing between them and victory in Wednesday's final. A win would secure them a spot in the Champions League, but a significant shake-up is needed this summer if Amorim hopes to compete in the tournament and restore United to Premier League prominence, especially as his current squad, inherited from Ten Hag, has struggled to adapt to his distinctive style of play."

      "Yet, that is exactly where Forest find themselves and for some corners of the fan base they might even find themselves frustrated if they do not find themselves in UEFA's top-tier club competition given how well they have done this season. Nuno Espirito Santo's side have spent more than half the season in the top five - where Champions League qualification is guaranteed - in the Premier League this season but have since dropped out picking up just one win in their last six appearances.",

      "Going into the penultimate weekend, Forest fans will be eagerly looking at Friday night's selection of Premier League matches with Europa League finalists Man United and Tottenham Hotspur both looking to make the most of the extra day's preparation for Bilbao but for Forest it will mean so much more if both sides get a respective result in this one.",
      "18+ | Gamble responsibly | gambleaware.org | Odds subject to change | (CopyBet)",
      "Starting off, Forest need both Villa and Chelsea to drop points at the very least and that will mean Spurs need to turn up the gears against Aston Villa who will be looking to make the most of the situation. Spurs have lost 20 times in the Premier League already this season and Ange Postecoglou will no doubt be prioritising the final in Bilbao which makes this a tough task for Forest fans.",
      "Spurs have won just once in their last 10 league outings despite finding themselves in a position to be in the Champions League group stages next season if they win in Bilbao. Even if a draw is hopeful, they still have only picked up two draws in the same time too - making this a difficult task at hand.",
      "Equally, Forest fans need the result at Stamford Bridge to go their way as Manchester United face Chelsea - who could really put themselves in the driving seat to return to the Champions League stage for the first time in three years. The Blues will be looking to make the most of the situation and put pressure on the likes of Man City and Arsenal above them going into the last day of the season.",
      "Of course, none of the aforementioned outcomes matter unless Forest do the business at the London Stadium against another incredibly underwhelming side, West Ham.

      "There was a time when Viktor Gyokeres could not get a kick for Brighton and Hove Albion - now the Sporting Lisbon colossus is being chased by Arsenal and Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres, 26, has established himself as one of the best strikers in world football over the last two years. At Brighton and while on loan at Swansea City, Gyokeres' opportunities were few and far between, particularly when he was at the Amex Stadium.",
      "After finding his goal-scoring range at Coventry City, Sporting took a chance on the Swede by signing him from the Sky Blues for £20million. Two-years later, he could soon be on his way to Arsenal, as the North Londoners have reportedly offered him a contract worth £7million a year after tax.",
      "Now he is in the headlines, several of his former team-mates and opponents spoke to French outlet RMC Sport to offer their thoughts on Gyokeres at the time, as well as what they make of him now. Ex-Huddersfield and Reading defender Naby Sarr, who faced him on multiple occasions, said: \"I dealt with two Gyokeres'. The first was already tough and strong, despite a lot of shortcomings.",
      "\"It was easy to stop him, his game was very readable. In the end, it was no longer the same story. He became ultra-complete, one of the best players I've faced. Speed, power, efficiency, technical accuracy... he worked on all these aspects.\"",
      "He added: \"What sets him apart from the others is that he's not lazy. His mindset has always been to tell himself that no ball is unplayable. Even if he seems unexploitable and is five meters behind, he'll go for it. He's poison.\"",
      "Other players who shared a dressing room with the Scandinavian recall a player who was friendly, humble, and hard-working, but often limited by his capabilities. One of those stars was Gaetan Bong, who played alongside Gyokeres at Brighton, when the striker was struggling to find the net.",
      "Bong, who retired in 2022, admitted he has been baffled by Gyokeres' ascent, saying: \"I remember seeing this unassuming guy arrive in the dressing room. It was surprising to see him there because Brighton were used to recruiting players in his position who were quick and easy on the ball.",
      "\"He already had an imposing physique, but how can I put it... Technically and in his finishing, it was... mediocre. He was far from the level of Glenn Murray, for example, who was our starting No.9.",
      "\"That day, we were working on free kicks and I saw the discreet Viktor coming into my zone. I was often given the strongest guys to mark me, so at the time I was calm and I told myself that I was going to try to intimidate him, just to welcome him.",
      "\"I grabbed his arm, I tried to move it, and there... wow! I saw that he was resisting. A wall! He had a lot of strength. I said to myself: 'OK, he's going to have to work hard, but at least he has a response, he's not there to be walked all over, and in duels he has what it takes.' It was a first good point.\"",
      "The same concerns were echoed by former Coventry colleague Maxime Biamou, who pointed out similar flaws in Gyokeres' game. Taking those into account, the Frenchman added: \"There was no indication that he was going to explode one day.\"",
      "Ironically, Gyokeres' biggest weakness in his development years was, in the opinion of ex-Coventry midfielder Wesley Jobello, his shooting and goal-scoring instincts, the very things he is a master off today. Jobello said: \"In matches, he had this way of charging head first, without asking any questions.",
      "\"He tried a lot and didn't care if he made a mistake. Right foot, left foot, he sent some serious concrete blocks, but it wasn't often on target.\"",
      "This season alone, Gyokeres has hammered 52 goals and 13 assists in just 50 appearances in all competitions. Arsenal, who are desperate for a striker, have been heavily linked with a move, while a reunion with Ruben Amorim at United has also been mentioned.",
      "What is for certain is that Gyokeres has terrified defences this season and intends on continuing to do so, whatever club he is at."

      "Arsenal are set to make a move for a new striker in the summer transfer window, but could face a tough decision over which of their top targets to pursue. RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has been one of the leading names mentioned to solve the club's problem position.",
      "The Gunners have not lived up to expectations in the Premier League. Mikel Arteta's squad are 15 points adrift of champions Liverpool and are battling to maintain second place ahead of their match against Newcastle United this weekend.",
      "Much of the criticism has been directed at Arsenal's inability to sign a striker, either last summer or in the January window. The issue was made worse by injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus. RB Leipzig star Sesko is one of the main names being linked with filling the number nine spot, but two obstacles could stop him from making a move to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "The Independent has reported that Arsenal are still weighing up whether to go for Sesko or Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres. The latter has maintained his impressive form in Portugal, scoring 52 goals in 50 appearances, while Sesko has scored 21 times for a struggling Leipzig team.",
      "Sesko, 21, is five years younger than Gyokeres and could offer better value for Arsenal's money in the long-term. However, Sporting striker Gyokeres is seen as more of a finished product and is reportedly available for around £60million.",
      "The arrival of Andrea Berta as Arsenal's sporting director has reignited speculation over the club's pursuit of former Coventry City star Gyokeres. This is despite the Independent reporting that the majority of necessary groundwork has already been completed to secure Sesko's services.",
      "Arsenal expressed interest in Sesko last summer but opted not to proceed until the transfer of Eddie Nketiah to Crystal Palace was confirmed. By then, Sesko had agreed to an extension with RB Leipzig, who are facing the possibility of a season without European competition.",
      "Sesko's agent Elvis Basanovic previously justified his client's decision to stay at Leipzig. When asked earlier in the season if Sesko was the solution to Arsenal's striker issue, Basanovic replied: \"I think you should ask Mr. Arteta about that. But I think Sesko could suit many clubs because he has different football skills,\" he told Slovenian TV channel Arena Sport.",
      "Basanovic shared the reasoning behind Sesko's new deal: \"We can see that our decision was correct. Six months later, he is already a better striker than he was last season,\" he said.",
      "\"What he lacks is experience. We must not forget that he is only 21 years old, so we did not want him to go to the Premier League in the summer. There were concrete options, but we consciously decided to stay in the Bundesliga to give him time to progress and develop into a better striker.\"",
      "Arsenal's focus on signing a centre-forward could inadvertently benefit Manchester United's summer transfer plans. Both United and the Gunners have been linked with Wolves star Matheus Cunha in recent months.",
      "While Arsenal remain interested in the Brazil international, it is Ruben Amorim's side who are widely reported to be winning the race for his signature. Cunha has scored 15 goals in 31 league games for Wolves this season.",
      "United will be eager to freshen up their attacking options as their forwards have struggled to score goals consistently. Bruno Fernandes is the club's top scorer in the Premier League with eight.",
      "Meanwhile, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike are still on Arsenal's watchlist, albeit further down than Sesko and Gyokeres. However, despite the club's fondness for the striker, a potential transfer for Newcastle's Alexander Isak seems improbable."

      "No other job in football carries the stress and anxiety of a manager. From Ruben Amorim to Nathan Jones, we’ve seen that pressure bubble to the surface this week, and the business end of the season does strange things to the psyche and demeanour of bosses feeling the heat.",
      "Amorim’s admission that Manchester United’s Premier League results on his watch have been “embarrassing” and questioning whether they are ready for Champions League football next season if they win the Europa League may have been honest. But some things in football are best left unsaid, or kept behind closed doors.",
      "Whether you are a head coach answerable to a director of football, or a manager in charge of the whole football operation, you are the face of a club, the man who carries the hopes of your fans and conveys them to the players.",
      "When things are going well, you take the plaudits. When they go badly, you take the responsibility - but you are the one empowered to do something about it.",
      "If you blame others before you have looked in the mirror, whether you operate in the Northern Premier League or the Champions League, maybe self-awareness is not your strongest suit.",
      "Amorim’s public statements were no doubt fuelled by raw emotion, but it’s reached the stage now where the only language United fans really want to hear is the vocabulary of a winner. If he lifts the Europa League trophy in Bilbao on Wednesday night, more than anything it will be a release of pressure.",
      "That pressure valve also best explains Jones’ behaviour on the touchline after Charlton’s tense League One play-off semi-final win against Wycombe on Thursday night.",
      "Kneeling in prayer before the final whistle, and then bursting into tears on all fours, was the portrait of a manager overwhelmed by relief and euphoria.",
      "But it makes you wonder how Jones will manage to contain his emotions if Charlton beat Leyton Orient in the final at Wembley!",
      "And it’s a reminder that this is the time of year when managers stand or fall on nine months of hard graft. For some, the season will end in triumph - but for others, like Ruben Selles at Hull, it ends harshly.",
      "I have no idea why Hull sacked Selles after he kept them in the Championship on the final day. What was his remit if it wasn’t to save them from relegation?",
      "This is the club who sacked Liam Rosenior last year - and he is on the brink of leading French club Strasbourg, Arsene Wenger’s former team, into Europe. Being a football manager is just about the only profession where people openly debate whether you should be fired.",
      "It’s the only profession where ‘experts’ on the outside pontificate on the job you’ve done when they don’t know half of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.",
      "Some pundits who have never been a manager have all the answers when they have never set foot inside a technical area. Others might have dipped their toe in the water for a few games, been unsuccessful and returned to the sofa because possibly it’s harder than it looks and maybe it’s not for them.",
      "Unless you have been at the sharp end, even if I only lasted five minutes, it’s a job like no other. But above all, to be a football manager you need personality, you need to communicate - even lower down the pyramid.",
      "Would you rather manage at my level, where you won’t go any higher if you keep making mistakes, or work at an EFL club where you might be thrust into a job and get another two or three opportunities even if you fail in the first one?",
      "At Macclesfield, we have enjoyed a record-breaking season and I have agreed a two-year contract nine months after putting my neck on the block by admitting my job would be untenable if we didn’t win promotion.",
      "But my first season as a manager has been an eye-opener like no other experience after almost 35 years in the game. Even at a non-League level, I can identify with the pressure Amorim, Jones and others have felt this week. And we wouldn’t swap it for the comfort zone in a million years."

United endured another abysmal performance when they lost 2-0 to West Ham United at Old Trafford last Sunday.",
      "The sacking of Erik ten Hag and subsequent appointment of Ruben Amorim in November was hoped to be a turning point for the club. However, with Amorim at the helm, United's league victories have been meagre, totalling just six in 26 matches with the most recent coming against since relegated Leicester City in March.",

It's unbelievable.\" On his own podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents, the former defender theorised that Amroim could be looking to execute a significant shakeup of the squad.",
      "\"I think he looks around the dressing room and thinks, 'If I could wave a magic wand, in the next five years at least 50 per cent of this team wouldn't be here.' Because they're not good enough and they're not right for the way he wants to play,\" Ferdinand argued.",
      "\"I look at him and think that he needs, minimum, two good windows of getting rid of the ones he doesn't require, but also getting in players that he really needs. There has to be a lot of things to go right for us to make a dramatic turn on this.",
      "\"He's coaching the team to understand what he wants, which has led to him getting terrible results in the Premier League consistently.\" Ferdinand isn't the only United legend to call for a complete revamp of the squad, with Gary Neville warning that it won't be easy to revert back to winning ways so soon.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, Neville said: “You’re talking about eight to 10 players have to go. They’re going to have to pay to get them out.\"",
      "United face Chelsea on Friday evening before wrapping up their domestic season against Aston Villa at Old Trafford a week on Sunday. They're yet to reach 40 points and could even finish just outside the relegation places in 17th.",

      "Three goals in 33 games is bad enough but Rasmus Hojlund's body language, and the unrestrained reactions of his teammates and coaches, are just as disconcerting.",
      "Hojlund was complaining to Mason Mount, a sympathetic sounding board, in the second half at Chelsea. Mount offered an encouraging pat on the head and then exited the pitch. Hojlund was suddenly devoid of an ally.",
      "At full-time, Hojlund turned to his fellow Scandinavian Victor Lindelof and was complaining about something or other. Lindelof soon spotted Jadon Sancho and was one of a handful of United players who acknowledged him.",
      "The press box at Stamford Bridge is directly behind the dugouts, separated by maybe half-a-dozen rows of spectators. Ruben Amorim was particularly piqued with a Dane, though it was Patrick Dorgu. His assistant, Paulo Barreira, was most animated with Hojlund.",
      "Another Portuguese, Bruno Fernandes, berated Hojlund in each half. After Hojlund killed an attack, there was that familiar sigh from the United supporters. It was all-too-familiar fare from a striker who is being bracketed with Garry Birtles, Radamel Falcao and Wout Weghorst.",
      "The punchline is Hojlund is certain to start the Europa League final. That could be his swansong as the starting striker for United. Hojlund was always destined to fail, by association with Kees Vos and the inexplicably exorbitant £72million fee United agreed for him at 3am at Atalanta's training ground.",
      "Amorim seriously tried to suggest he is happy with Hojlund at Stamford Bridge. \"I’m happy. Of course, all the team has to improve, but the way he runs, he fights for every ball, loses a lot of duels, wins some duels, he needs to improve the connection.",
      "\"But he is improving. I’m really happy with him, he just needs to continue working hard and better things will come.\"",
      "In his question to Amorim, a colleague remarked that Hojlund's performance \"left a lot to be desired\". Amorim was never going to dispute that.",
      "Senior figures at United are not having Hojlund. One well-placed source suggested he does not work hard enough. They can cut loose as it is well-established that Hojlund will be replaced in the summer. Amorim, though strikingly frank about United's ills, can't.",
      "The coaching staff have been losing patience with Hojlund for some time. Teammates were hesitant about passing the ball to Hojlund last season and it has been more brazen this season.",
      "Off the pitch, Hojlund is so desperate for approval he is resorting to crass captions, clearly curated by a tone-deaf social media team, on Instagram posts for the banter brigade. All he succeeds in doing is imitating Neal Maupay, one of the worst strikers to ever get a kick in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system is geared to service the striker, so he was never going to entertain the prospect of picking a strikerless team after Joshua Zirkzee was ruled out for the rest of the season last month. Amorim confirmed on Easter Sunday that it would do no good to remove Hojlund from the team. He has stuck to his guns even as Hojlund continues to fire blanks.",
      "There have been two tap-ins since then and a fine performance at Athletic Bilbao, a man light for 55 minutes after Dani Vivian tugged at Hojlund’s shirt. But the Premier League is the truest gauge and Hojlund will be pitted against Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero back in Bilbao. That could be as much of a mismatch as two bouncers turning away an underage schoolboy from a nightclub.",
      "Erik ten Hag dropped Hojlund for United's final three games last season and it was a masterstroke. United won all three, climaxing with their best performance of the post-Ferguson era against City in the FA Cup final.",
      "Hojlund came on in all three wins, scoring against Newcastle United and Brighton before a constructive cameo at Wembley. He left the national stadium that evening swigging from a magnum of champagne.",
      "Gaining the number nine shirt in the summer reaffirmed United's long-term backing for Hojlund. Perhaps things might have been different had he not pulled his hamstring minutes after scoring against Arsenal in the otherworldly So-Fi Stadium in Los Angeles. Hojlund required another scan on the other side of the Atlantic as the first was inconclusive and he was out for eight weeks.",
      "Yet Hojlund has been at United for 22 months now and his first season was creditable. It was not unreasonable to expect or aim for an improvement on his 16 goals last season.",
      "Eleven of his 26 goals have come in the Champions League and Europa League. United have a surfeit of players better suited to European competition (Zirkzee, Dorgu Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to name but four). That is primarily why their supporters have been subjected to the worst United side since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "Tommy Docherty's main recruit that summer was Stuart Pearson. A striker. Hojlund's teammates and coaches seem to be pining for a different striker."

But he is improving. I’m really happy with him, he just needs to continue working hard and better things will come.\"",

      "Hojlund has taken huge backwards steps this season and persisting with him against Tottenham might not make sense because he will just produce more of the same at the Estadio de San Mames.",
      "Perhaps the only case in favour of starting Hojlund in the Europa League final is that he performed well against Athletic Bilbao in the semi-final first leg. Amorim suggested Hojlund produced the best display of his tenure in that game, which might be enough for him to keep his starting role.",
      "The argument to drop Hojlund is stronger. United could play with a false nine in the Europa League final and that element of unpredictability would be an advantage against Tottenham.",
      "Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Amad and Kobbie Mainoo are candidates to play in the false nine role.",
      "Erik ten Hag named Hojlund on the bench for last season's FA Cup final and played with a false nine, which proved to be an inspired tactical decision against Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "Hojlund could find himself in the unfortunate position of being dropped for successive finals in successive seasons, which shouldn't happen to a player who was signed in a £72million deal.",
      "Supporters should not entirely give up on Hojlund. He is still only 22 years old and he's been tasked with leading the attack in a struggling team, but you don't need to be a rocket scientist to conclude United grossly overpaid for him.",
      "Amorim has gone from working with Viktor Gyökeres, one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe, to a striker who has just a handful of goals in the Premier League this season.",
      "He won't admit it in public, but Amorim will be far from \"happy\" about that."

      "He received the ball in a dangerous position during a good spell early in the second half, but was then ponderous in possession and the move broke down. A minute later, Fernandes was under pressure in midfield and had no out-ball. When he was dispossessed, he reacted furiously at Hojlund, who had been stationary rather than giving him an option.",
      "It was a reminder why a striker is right at the top of United's shopping list this summer, with £30million Liam Delap leading the race to lead the line next season.",
      "Onana gets away with one",
      "Enzo Fernandez would have been relieved to see the offside flag go up after he blazed over the rebound from Cole Palmer's shot late in the first half, but Andre Onana would also have been delighted to see Fernandez spoon his effort over the bar.",
      "Onana's save from Palmer's deflected shot looked spectacular, but it didn't need to be. The ball was spinning, and it looked like the goalkeeper got his timing wrong. In the end, he simply palmed the ball straight back into his six-yard box, presenting Fernandez with a big chance.",
      "Thankfully for Onana, the Argentine made a mess of it and the flag was up anyway, but it was a reminder of the little issues that continue to crop up in Onana's game.",
      "Maguire disappointed",
      "Harry Maguire has made a habit of popping up with late goals this season and has done a passable impression of a striker at times. He was still playing centre-back when he slammed in a half-volley from Fernandes' cross and then celebrated as if it was an everyday occurrence.",
      "You could tell it was a great goal and a superb strike from a player not noted for that sort of connection, because the United subs were on their feet and craning their necks to get a replay, with coach Adelio Candido in charge of the tablet.",
      "When that replay was viewed, it looked like Maguire might have been marginally offside. As VAR Craig Pawson reviewed the footage, Maguire looked over to the bench for information, and Amorim responded with a gesture that told him it was tight.",
      "Maguire probably knew what was coming next and his head slumped when he realised his sweet strike was being chalked off.",
      "Mount booing",
      "Chelsea fans gave Mason Mount a tougher time in his second return to Stamford Bridge than they did on his first game back last season, when he came on for the final four minutes of a madcap 4-3 defeat. Mount came on when United led 3-2 and walked off after they had contrived to throw the game away.",
      "The difference now is that he's in the best moment of his United career and returned not only feeling fit and in form, but with the chance to really stake a claim to start the Europa League final next week.",
      "So he was always likely to cop a bit more flak this time around, although in truth it doesn't really make a lot of sense. He left Chelsea for a good transfer fee and gave excellent service to the club. It's hard to see why they have such an issue with him.",
      "Away end",
      "It was another superb United away end in the capital, with the Shed End vista for visiting fans an excellent one these days at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The atmosphere was outstanding throughout and even after watching defeat No.18 of the Premier League season, they applauded the players and sang about adventures to come in Bilbao."

      "Welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, May 17.",
      "United have now played their final game before Wednesday night's Europa League final with Tottenham. Ruben Amorim's men lost 1-0 to Chelsea to continue their Premier League woes.",
      "As has been the case for a while now, the focus isn't on the league with all eyes on next week. United know victory will secure Champions League football at Old Trafford, something that would significantly bolster their pull in the transfer market.",
      "Many names have been linked with a move in recent weeks with Antoine Semenyo, Serhou Guirassy, Leroy Sane and Callum Hudson-Odoi all emerging as possible targets.",
      "Any signings are expected to come as a result of player sales. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are all expected to be sold after spending the current season out on loan. Meanwhile, former boss Jose Mourinho is believed to be sniffing around United looking for a deal.",
      "We will keep you up to date on all this and more in our United blog below...",
      "Borussia Dortmund star Serhou Guirassy has emerged as a shock contender to join Man United's attack.",
      "Team Talk have reported that United are one of the clubs allowed to activate his €70million release clause. The report states how his release clause is only in place for big clubs like United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City, Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "Real Madrid are moving rapidly to make former Manchester United defender Alvaro Carreras their next signing after completing their move to sign Dean Huijsen.",
      "AS have claimed that the left-back's move to Spain is 90% done. United have a buy-back option worth £15m, a fraction of the £42.1m release clause reports state Madrid will pay.",
      "They also have a significant sell-on clause meaning they will bank a tidy fee from the move.",
      "Writing for Football Insider, former United scout Mick Brown has insisted that the club will not be looking to sell their captain to Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, despite a lucrative offer likely being submitted.",
      "He explained:",
      "Man United will not let Bruno Fernandes go to Saudi. Losing him would be catastrophic, wherever he goes or for whatever reason. It shouldn’t even be a question, there should be no way they even consider letting Fernandes leave regardless of the money involved. The focus is on getting players in around him. They want to strengthen the squad and take the burden away from him, but whatever happens he’s going to be a crucial part of the team.",
      "Ahead of tonight's Premier League clash with Chelsea, Paul Merson has told Amorim that under no circumstances should he be picking Fernandes to start.",
      "He explained in his Sportskeeda column:",
      "The last thing Manchester United should do is start Bruno Fernandes against Chelsea. He's been their best player and you can't risk him being injured for the big final.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "Friday night's loss to Chelsea set two bad records for Man United.",
      "The defeat means United will end a first ever Premier League season without winning back-to-back games on any occasion. It also means they have now gone eight games with a Premier League win for the first time in history.",
      "A torrid sight.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur boss Ange Postecoglou has given the latest update on two injury worries ahead of the Europa League final against Manchester United.",
      "Both United and Spurs were in action in the Premier League on Friday night. While United fell to a 1-0 away loss against Chelsea, Spurs were beaten 2-0 by Aston Villa at Villa Park.",
      "Midfielder Pape Matar Sarr was taken off in the second half, the midfielder was replaced by Yves Bissouma and went straight down the tunnel with a member of the Spurs medical team.",
      "“Pape felt something in his back so we took him off as a bit of a precaution,” the Spurs boss said in his post-match press conference, via football.london.",
      "Real Betis will reportedly struggle financially to sign Antony on a permanent basis, something that could leave the door open for a move elsewhere.",
      "Atletico Madrid and Villarreal are both interested in signing the Brazilian. Both teams are set to be able to offer Champions League football to the winger.",
      "Roy Keane has slammed Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo, claiming he doesn't see them three players bringing Man United back to the glory days.",
      "Asked if he 'fight' to keep the trio this summer, he said: \"I wouldn't be hanging my hat on those three to get Man United [back]. \"Mainoo comes on tonight, I watched him closely – he's strolling around, some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho is immature. He plays in little moments, but he doesn't do enough.",
      "\"We spoke before the programme - you want players for the big clubs that turn up week in, week out. He doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent; he makes some good runs and threatens in behind.",
      "\"On his good day, you think, 'I like what I see.' But he's got too many bad days. And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have been a backup striker, third or fourth choice, and learnt his trade off of two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact that when he came to the club he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough! He's obviously lacking in confidence and belief and he's not surrounded by brilliance either.",
      "\"The problems we've spoken about at Manchester United all season are still there. Now if people think they can fix that in one summer then it's not going to happen.\"",
      "Juventus have joined the race to sign Victor Osimhen this summer but reports add that Manchester United and other English clubs have an advantage.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic is on the verge of signing for Atletico Madrid meaning Juve are pushing for a new striker. However, Napoli are said to be reluctant to improve one of their league rivals and will demand a higher fee compared to the one on offer for United.",
      "Osimhen's £64m release clause is only applicable to teams outside of Italy.",
      "If you thought Hojlund uniting with Mourinho in Turkey was out of left field, this next rumour is certainly going to surprise.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport, Inter Milan are interested in moving for Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "What's more, they are reportedly preparing a £35m plus bonuses deal for the forward.",
      "It is believed they would want to initially sign the Dutchman on loan but include an option to buy at the end of next season.",

      "According to Foot Mercato, via Football365, Manchester United are among the clubs to be offered Bayern Munich attacker Leroy Sane.",
      "The 29-year-old is out of contract this summer and has yet to pen-to-paper on new terms at the Allianz Arena.",
      "As a result, Vincent Kompany's side risk losing him as a free agent in the summer.",
      "The report claims that Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have been offered his services.",
      "Inter are reportedly trying to sign Joshua Zirkzee.",

      "It has been suggested that the deal would be a loan with an option to buy.",
      "Harry Maguire has pulled no punches in his damning assessment of Man United's season.",
      "He said:",
      "\"It does, especially the last couple of months.",
      "\"But we've got to take the blame for that because a club like Manchester United should not have nothing to play for with two months left of the season.",
      "\"We're sat in midtable and we've got nothing to play for. That's our fault.",
      "\"We have to take responsibility on that because it's unacceptable, for sure.",

      "“Everything stands or falls with a policy that is simply supported by everyone. I think that has not always been the case in all those years (since Sir Alex).",
      "“It was the same in the early period at Ajax (for Ten Hag). Erik also had a difficult period then. He overcame that with the people around him. I actually expected that at United too.",
      "“Only because, I think, there was another power vacuum…The club was put up for sale or partially sold, which gave James Ratcliffe 50% of the shares and the sporting part.",
      "“In addition, a new CEO and a new technical director came, who often want to appoint a manager in their own line. So yes. It was actually almost written in the stars that it would happen like this.”",
      "In another shock transfer rumour, it appears that Inter are interested in United forward Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "It is claimed by Corriere dello Sport that the Italian club would be willing to sign Zirkzee on an initial season-long loan deal before paying £35m next summer.",
      "United's forward is currently out for the remainder of the season with a hamstring injury but while his goal return has been poor, there have been signs that he can fit into Amorim's system as a No.10.",

      "Manchester United youngsters Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson have picked up prestigious academy awards.",
      "Amass has been named the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year after a standout 2024/25 campaign, while Fredricson has picked up the Denzil Haroun Reserve-Team Player of the Year award.",
      "Ruben Amorim has promoted both youngsters to the first-team squad in the last two months.",
      "Amass was given his senior debut against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on March 16, and Fredricson made his senior bow against Wolves at Old Trafford on April 20.",
      "Both youngsters have made further first-team appearances and their impressive campaigns have been recognised by academy staff, who decide which players should win the awards.",
      "Head of the academy, Nick Cox, said about Amass: “We’re delighted to recognise Harry’s hard work and achievements with this award.",
      "“Since joining the club, he’s shown an ability to adapt, settle into a new environment and progress as a person and a player. Harry had an outstanding first season with the club, and was already enjoying time around the first team in 2023/24 as a result.",
      "“Harry has represented the Under-18s in the league and FA Youth Cup this season, enjoyed UEFA Youth League experience at Old Trafford and in the Netherlands with the Under-19s, and played for the Under-21s in the league and EFL Trophy.",
      "\"These experiences, and the work done by the Professional Development Phase staff, helped him prepare for the opportunity when it came, and we’ve been delighted to see the trust placed in Harry by Ruben Amorim and his staff.”",
      "Amass won the coveted Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award after Ethan Wheatley, Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, and he is now hoping to consolidate his position in the first-team squad.",
      "Cox added about Fredricson: “Tyler has shown fantastic qualities of perseverance, determination and patience to earn first-team opportunities this season.",
      "“When you add that to the quality he’s demonstrated since he first joined our pre-Academy, you get a really impressive young footballer. Tyler has captained our youth sides in a variety of competitions across two different age levels, and always represented the club with distinction.",
      "“His performances at Under-21s level saw him become a part of the senior training group, like many of our players this season. We’re very proud of how our players have conducted themselves, but especially pleased when they show enough in training to earn the manager’s trust, as Tyler has done.”"

      "The Manchester United supporters were certain to turn up at Stamford Bridge. True to their Premier League form, the players did not.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, the most senior United players, rounded on Alejandro Garnacho immediately after Marc Cucurella broke the deadlock in the 71st minute. Garnacho had been on the pitch for less than two minutes and he was about as much of an obstacle as a training cone for Reece James, who danced past him and whipped the ball in for his fellow full back.",
      "Such indolence could have major ramifications for Garnacho. It felt telling he was benched for the second game running for the first time since early January. All signs now point towards Mason Mount retaining his place in Bilbao on Wednesday over a forward who lined up for the 14th successive match last week.",
      "Ruben Amorim has agonised over pragmatic and proactive styles at United. In the Europa League, he has erred on the side of the former and it has served him well. This possible dress rehearsal could convince him not to dress up the United team against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "It would not be particularly palatable for United's supporters to have Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, the matchwinners of last year's FA Cup final and academy products, sat in the dugout. But it is a means to an end and you can hardly blame Amorim with the season on the line.",
      "He picked a team that could conceivably line up again in Bilbao. Fernandes and Maguire, two totemic players, combined for United's standout piece of play all night. The trouble was Maguire had strayed marginally offside for his striker's finish.",
      "And so another record tumbles. United are eight games without a league win for the first time since January 1990. It is 18 league defeats for the season, a -12 goal difference and 15th match without scoring. They are only marooned in 16th as Tottenham also lost.",
      "\"Follow, follow, follow\" segues seamlessly to \"Hollow, hollow, hollow\", a chant United supporters have aired to bait Chelsea for 18 years. They dusted off 'Viva John Terry' again, a reminder of their last Champions League triumph and headier days.",
      "Chelsea have their own European final and could qualify for the Champions League. You would have thought United were in a more auspicious position in the table until Cucurella connected with James' cross.",
      "Aston Villa's victory over Tottenham, and their temporary ascent to fifth at Chelsea's expense, was all but confirmed at half-time. That did not improve the mood at a club where the friction between matchgoers and coach is palpable. Enzo Maresca got so hot under the collar in the first half that he removed his jacket.",
      "Chelsea resorted to desperate measures as the young striker Tyrique George threw himself to the turf amid the onrushing Andre Onana. Referee Chris Kavanagh signalled a penalty but the replay made its overturn inevitable.",
      "Amorim and Maresca were arm-in-arm. Willy Caballero, the former Manchester City goalkeeper, continued to remonstrate and was urged to watch a replay on the big screen by Amorim. That barely elicited a murmur from Chelsea fans.",
      "It was only after Amorim made changes with Wednesday in mind that Chelsea capitalised. Casemiro had been a solid shield all night and Mount's best work is often off the ball. The same cannot be said of Garnacho.",
      "The die had been cast with Patrick Dorgu pitted against James. Dorgu, like his fellow Dane Rasmus Hojlund, is a 20-year-old first-teamer who ought to be playing second fiddle. He has suffered in the absence of Diogo Dalot on the opposite flank.",
      "Maresca and captain James billed the game as \"big\" in their programme notes. Amorim's selection ensured the edge would not be completely taken off United's own performance.",
      "So did his demanding demeanour on the touchline. He clapped his hands on three separate occasions to prompt the United backline to advance and went ballistic over an aimless pass by Dorgu. Amorim, shaking his head, turned away from the pitch to bemoan Dorgu's shortcomings to his staff.",
      "It was Amorim's assistant's turn to despair at Dorgu in the second half. Carlos Fernandes hollered Dorgu's name repeatedly as United prepared for a set piece yet his voice did not carry. It did coincide with a rendition of 'Follow, follow, follow'.",
      "Amorim has a kindred spirit in his compatriot and captain. Fernandes glared at Hojlund for selling him short with a pass and, come the next stoppage, rebuked the Dane. There was also a piqued pirouette from Amorim after Onana went short, rather than long, with the ball. United progressed the ball from their own third yet it was inevitably lost when they pinged the ball forward for Hojlund.",
      "Frustration got the better of Hojlund, who used Mount as a sympathetic sounding board. Mount offered him an encouraging pat on the head. Mount was treated to some applause when he came on at his former club last year. His starting status did not afford him that privilege this time.",
      "The booing for the Chelsea Champions League winner was louder and more caustic. The Matthew Harding Stand sang, \"Chelsea reject\". Cole Palmer was the \"City reject\".",
      "Mount was responsible for United's only official attempt at goal in the first half that ended up nearer the corner flag. He went closer in the second but was quick not to dwell on the missed opportunity yards away from frothing Chelsea supporters. Amorim gave Mount a hearty hug and pat when he removed him in the 70th minute.",
      "Garnacho, his replacement, is still one of the few players who is serenaded by the matchgoers, as he discovered when he embarked on his first warm up in the 38th minute. The night nevertheless ended as it started: with a rendition of 'Follow, follow, follow'.",
      "The supporters had turned up."

      "Qualification for Europe's premier competition will be a welcome boost to the club's finances, while defeat in Spain will see the loser miss out on European football altogether next term.",
      "United are keen to sign at least three priority signings this summer and would ideally like up to four new additions.",

      "He has been tentatively linked with a return to Old Trafford and would offer extra depth to their midfield options.",
      "Similarly, at centre-half, there are two quality options available to United. Jonathan Tah said his farewells to Bayer Leverkusen last week, having helped the German side win an unbeaten domestic league and cup double last season.",
      "The 29-year-old has been on United's radar and has been linked with Barcelona, but looks more likely to sign for Bayern Munich.",
      "However, PSV's French defender Olivier Boscagli could offer an interesting alternative. The former France under-21 international has spent the last six years in Eindhoven and he looks set to win a second Eredivisie title with the club this weekend.",
      "But he will leave at the end of his contract and has reportedly attracted interest from Real Madrid, as well as Borussia Dortmund, Monaco and Brighton. The 27-year-old is a left-footed centre-half and could prove to be a dependable option.",
      "United have targets in mind but the free transfer market could be one they turn to as they look to spend within their budget."

All the other players tell me that the stadium is something special. I think it's been a very positive season, we've reached our objective.\"",
      "He further shared his personal connection with the city, saying: \"I feel at home here. I recently had a baby here with my girlfriend. Not a lot of people get to experience that kind of thing here and with all my teammates and coaches I would like to thank them all.\"",
      "The Telegraph has reported that insiders at Marseille are open to the possibility of Greenwood being transferred within the next two seasons.",
      "Despite Greenwood's impressive goal-scoring record, he has drawn criticism from fans and manager Roberto De Zerbi for his work rate. Rumours have circulated that team-mate Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg requested his removal from the squad, and De Zerbi has previously stated his expectations of the player.",
      "De Zerbi earlier this year said: \"No one can have more respect for him than I do. But that doesn't change anything: I expect more from him. He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough.\"",
      "He added: \"If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\""

      "Manchester United's struggles in attack continued in Friday night's Premier League defeat to Chelsea.",
      "With Joshua Zirkzee out injured, Ruben Amorim has only one option up front and that's Rasmus Hojlund. The striker, who cost £72million in 2023, has scored 10 goals this season, averaging out at just one goal every 10 games.",
      "For the second straight Premier League game, Hojlund played the entirety of the match and failed to make an impact. It was another blank to demonstrate why United have prioritised signing a new striker in the summer transfer window.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap are the prime targets at Old Trafford with the Brazilian 'optimistic' of joining the club. There have also been links to Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres but another wildcard option to reinforce the attack has emerged in the last 72 hours.",
      "Borussia Dortmund striker Serhou Guirassy is one of Europe's most prolific strikers with 33 goals in 43 matches in Germany this season. The Guinea star only joined the Yellow Wall last summer but he has already been tipped for an exit.",
      "According to German publication BILD, Guirassy has a €70million (£60m) release clause in his contract at the Westfaldenstadion which is only active to a small host of clubs - and United are said to be one of them.",
      "It's claimed that United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Barcelona are all able to trigger the release clause. The report states that any other clubs are not permitted to activate the clause.",
      "Guirassy was linked with a move to United prior to his move to Dortmund. However, he left Stuttgart and joined the German giants in a deal worth £15m.",
      "The Dortmund forward's £60m fee is a similar price that United will have to pay for Cunha to prise him away from Wolves. Delap has a £30m release clause at Ipswich Town and would come with one season of Premier League experience."

      "Another mea culpa for Manchester United. The sight of a defeated, disgruntled squad standing apologetically in front of supporters who had again given them backing they couldn't live up to has been a familiar one this season.",
      "For the 18th time in the Premier League, United were beaten. This one doesn't even come close to entering the top 10 for embarrassments this term and, in many ways, they will just be happy to have escaped intact. But it was a familiar feeling and a familiar sight.",
      "Having spent much of the game serenading Ruben Amorim and singing about Bilbao, the away end broke into 'We love United' at full-time. It felt telling. It was another reminder that they are sticking with the team despite a league table that makes for painful and shameful viewing. But then, this was never close to being the main event over the next week.",
      "United could have been forgiven for just being glad this game was over. There were no injuries, no damaging loss of confidence, and no damage done. They didn't play like a team with both eyes elsewhere, but their Premier League season has been without a pulse for months.",
      "European adventures have kept the fires burning, and one more awaits on Wednesday. Amorim will protest otherwise, and he is clearly embarrassed about a record of just six wins from his 26 Premier League games in charge, but this was a match Chelsea had to win, and United had to survive - which they did.",
      "The clear blue skies and soaring temperatures made West London feel like Bilbao on Friday night. It was actually hotter in West London than in the Basque Country and the weather will again be better in Manchester next week, not that it will stop the travelling hordes from enjoying them.",
      "You could hear United fans chanting about going to Bilbao from late afternoon around Earl's Court. It was the first song to get an airing once the game had kicked off at Stamford Bridge. The atmosphere from that corner of the Shed End never relented after that.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou had taken the decision to rest some key players at Villa Park, Amorim had gone strong at Chelsea. You would expect at least nine of this starting XI to start the Europa League final.",
      "That made avoiding injuries the priority, and the sight of Bruno Fernandes twice hitting the deck inside the first eight minutes would have been an unsettling one on the United bench. Harry Maguire and Amad also suffered knocks to the face and ankle, but were able to continue without treatment.",
      "It showed the competitiveness was still there for a team whose priority had clearly shifted as this season had gone on. They looked more assured in this game than they have in many Premier League assignments and grew in confidence as well.",
      "They mustered just one first-half shot, a Mason Mount effort on the stretch that drifted well wide. But they were better after the break, got more men forward and posed more of a threat. Mount should have done better after one slick attack with Amad and Fernandes fired over after Amad had again caused problems with his runs down the left.",
      "When Manuel Ugarte and Alejandro Garnacho came on for the final quarter, with Casemiro and Mount making way, it felt like the final auditions for places in Amorim's team next week were underway.",
      "That pair might have felt they were certain starters a couple of weeks ago, but the picture has changed. Amad has returned looking as sharp as he was before his three-month lay-off, and Mount is in the best spell of his form since his £60million move from Chelsea.",
      "Casemiro would appear a certain starter, having saved his best for Europe this season. He has been looking more secure domestically and it was probably no surprise that when he was withdrawn at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea began to turn the screw and took the lead a couple of minutes later.",
      "Ugarte would expect to start as well, even if his own performances recently have dipped, although with Tottenham's three most creative midfielders also likely to be absent, there would be an argument to play only one of Casemiro and Ugarte.",
      "That would allow Amad and Garnacho to start as No.10s. Otherwise, it feels like they are either competing for the same spot in the team, or Amorim goes bold and restores the former to a wing-back role and drops Noussair Mazraoui to the centre of defence.",
      "The fitness of Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt must also be considered, and Amorim will be desperately hoping one of them can get back in time for the final. But in all likelihood, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire, and Luke Shaw will start against Tottenham.",
      "When the teamsheet drops in Bilbao, you would expect to see Andre Onana, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Mazraoui, Casemiro, Dorgu, Fernandes and Hojlund. Ugarte, Mount, Garnacho and Amad might be scrapping it out for the other two places.",
      "On this evidence, Amad should be upgraded to a certain starter. He was again United's brightest attacker, both creatively and with testing Robert Sanchez as they chased an equaliser. Mark him down as the 10th starter. Now, it's down to Ugarte, Mount or Garnacho."

Garnacho had been on the pitch for less than two minutes and he was about as much of an obstacle as a training cone for Reece James, who danced past him and whipped the ball in for his fellow full back.",
      "Such indolence could have major ramifications for Garnacho. It felt telling he was benched for the second game running for the first time since early January. All signs now point towards Mason Mount retaining his place in Bilbao on Wednesday over a forward who lined up for the 14th time in succession last week.",

      "While the upcoming Europa League final against Tottenham could offer something positive to cap off a frustrating season, there is no denying that major work needs to be done in the upcoming transfer window. Amorim, together with the club’s recruitment team, will need to make some big and decisive calls when it comes to both incomings and outgoings.",

According to a report from The Telegraph earlier this month, United are preparing to battle Liverpool and Newcastle for the 25-year-old's signature.",
      "Of course, departures may be necessary to pave the way for new arrivals, and one player who could be on the move is forward Joshua Zirkzee. Despite only arriving at Old Trafford from Bologna last summer, the Dutchman is already being linked with a return to Italy.",
      "According to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport, Champions League finalists Inter Milan have registered their interest and are preparing to table a formal bid.",
      "Should Zirkzee leave - either for Inter or another destination - the No.11 shirt would become vacant. While Mbeumo currently wears the No.19 at Brentford, he previously wore the No.11 during his time at French club Troyes, before making the move to West London in the summer of 2019.",

      "Even with Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans set to depart this summer and the injury record of some of those defensive options, moving for another central back feels a risk when United will have to box clever with their signings.",

      "Tottenham Hotspur have been dealt an injury scare ahead of the UEFA Europa League final. Manchester United will lock horns with the Lilywhites at the San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao on Wednesday night, with a piece of silverware up for grabs.",
      "Pape Matar Sarr was prematurely substituted during Spurs' clash against Aston Villa on Friday night, sparking concern that he's picked up a knock. Rather than seating himself on the bench, the 22-year-old midfielder was ushered down the tunnel by a member of the Tottenham medical staff.",
      "Yves Bissouma replaced Sarr shortly after the break and, just moments later, Ezri Konsa fired Aston Villa into the lead. The 27-year-old defender latched onto a loose ball in the six-yard box following a deep corner, hooking it past Antonín Kinský.",
      "Rooted to the spot, Bissouma was nutmegged by the strike. Sarr could join a long list of injured players at Tottenham ahead of the Europa League final; Dejan Kulusevski recently suffered a knee injury, which required surgery.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of the trip to Villa Park, Ange Postecoglou announced the setback. The Tottenham boss said: \"Disappointing news. Initially, we thought it wasn’t too serious.",
      "\"The medical team were worried structurally about how the knee was, but it blew up the day after, and we knew there was an issue there. He has had surgery, and it will put him out for at least a few months.\"",
      "On whether he'll be fit for the start of next season, Postecoglou added: \"We will see. To be honest, I have only got basic information at the moment in terms of recovery but it will certainly put him out for a while.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Lucas Bergvall is nursing an ankle injury. On whether the 19-year-old midfielder has made a 'miraculous recovery', Postecoglou said: \"No, it is still the same sort of timeframe.",
      "\"He was never a long-term one, but he has literally just got out of the boot and taken his first tentative steps on the grass, but he won’t be available [for the Villa clash on Friday].\"",
      "On whether the flurry of injuries has affected morale ahead of the United clash next week, Postecoglou said: \"Look, I guess because it’s been a constant with us during the year, we’ve kind of become almost accustomed to it.",
      "\"It would probably be a bigger issue if we had a smooth run all year and got hit with injuries now and deal with missing key players, but we’ve pretty much been without key players all season.",
      "\"There hasn’t been a time where we had a three or four week spell with our strongest line-up, so the boys are getting on with it. They’re disappointed for the people involved and Deki being the latest one because he had a fantastic first part of the year for us and was just working his way back into it.",
      "\"At the same time as I keep saying to the group all along, you can’t pick and choose when these opportunities come along. There could be other years where we don’t have these disruptions and injuries, but we don’t get to a final.",
      "\"The reality of it is now the opportunity is there and whatever happens between now and then, we’ve got to make sure we’re ready for it...\"",
      "Another injury to a Tottenham player could throw a spanner in the United works ahead of the Europa League final. Ruben Amorim may find it difficult predict Spurs' lineup, thus complicating his own preparation."

      "United, who have had another disappointing season, looked to build momentum heading into the Europa League final on May 21. The visitors thought they had gone ahead at Stamford Bridge when Maguire volleyed Bruno Fernandes' cross past Robert Sanchez.",
      "However, celebrations were short-lived as the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) ruled the goal out, judging Maguire to be offside when the cross was delivered.",
      "\"VAR checked the referee’s call of goal – and determined that Maguire was in an offside position and recommended that the goal was disallowed,\" the Premier League's Match Centre explained on X after the goal was ruled out.",
      "He said: \"He's trying but you would have to give Chelsea a little bit of credit because they've held their line well, very brave. Brilliant ball, absolutely amazing finish like a top striker. Very cruel. Look how tight that is. Tough to take.\"",
      "Presenter David Jones said: \"Bit of shoulder. That's all it takes these days. Offside is offside.\"",
      "\"Offside by the shoulder, it's football,\" Jamie Redknapp said before the former Liverpool midfielder called for a change to the rules following the VAR decision.",
      "\"I'd like to see that rule changed one day and make it so it's your feet or whatever. It doesn't really work in the favour of the forwards because you're always trying to lean forwards so your shoulder's naturally going to be offside and the defender's trying to go the other way. I would like to see it changed.\"",

      "Manchester United are seven games without a win in the Premier League and last won at Stamford Bridge in February 2020.",
      "Tonight they return to the scene of one of their most numbing results last season. United were 3-2 up as the clock ticked past the 90th minute. They lost 4-3.",
      "Chelsea have their own European final to prepare for but do not come up against Antony in the Conference League until Wednesday week. United's most consequential match in years against Tottenham is on Wednesday.",
      "This is United's antepenultimate fixture in what has hitherto been their worst season in 51 years. Here are five things to look out for at Chelsea tonight:",
      "Hints at final XI?",
      "The five-day gap United have between Chelsea and the Europa League final should ensure Amorim picks a reasonably strong side. Andre Onana, Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu, Casemiro and Alejandro Garnacho, all benched against West Ham United, could return.",
      "The majority who do not play tonight can effectively be discounted as a starter against Spurs. The only allowance Amorim could make is for Leny Yoro, given how recent his foot injury was.",
      "Another unwanted stat?",
      "Last week marked the first time United have gone seven league games without a win since November 1992. Weeks after that winless run, Eric Cantona was paraded at Old Trafford.",
      "It is too late for a signing to save this league season for United and more records could still tumble before next week's finale against Aston Villa. Fail to beat Chelsea tonight and it is the first eight-game winless streak in the league since January 1990, the last season that United finished in the bottom half. The season ended with Alex Ferguson's first trophy in the FA Cup.",
      "Centre back trial and error?",
      "Noussair Mazraoui was one of the players to speak at United's Uefa media day on Wednesday, a signal he will start in Bilbao. Mazraoui has started in all but eight of United's 57 matches this season and merits inclusion in Amorim's XI next week.",
      "The Moroccan played in a back three against West Ham, with Amad on the right. That seemed to be a dress rehearsal for their possible roles against Spurs and the injury to Yoro should not necessarily have a bearing on that.",
      "Yet if Yoro is out, Amorim will have to consider Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof. Shaw was taken off at the same time as Yoro against West Ham to protect him amid the spate of injuries at centre back. Lindelof lined up in both semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Ayden Heaven has travelled with the squad for tonight's game but he hasn't played since the 3-0 win over Leicester two months ago.",
      "Where does Amad start?",
      "Whatever United's best team is, Amad has to be in it. Amorim has played Amad on the wing and as one of the two No.10s since his return from an ankle injury two weeks ago.",
      "Amad has scored one goal, assisted another, helped change the game against Athletic in the second leg and was United's sole positive against West Ham.",
      "A rousing send-off",
      "The switch of the away end at Stamford Bridge from the east stand to the Shed End in 2005 has seen the ground host some raucous United atmospheres over the past 20 years. The ridiculous 7pm Sunday night kick-off United had at Leicester in March made no difference to United's supporters, who were in their finest voice all season.",
      "A similar atmosphere is probable this evening. United are five days out from a European final and their matchgoers will sing about it incessantly. Some will doubtless remain in London and fly to Bilbao from Heathrow or Gatwick."

      "Man Utd lose to ‘Kavanagh FC’\nIn the money laundering cycle, I believe Chris Kavanagh tonight was what you’d call the washing part of the cycle. United 14 “fouls” and 6 yellows. Chelsea only 10 fouls (should have been plenty more) and 1 yellow for time wasting. Nothing for simulation, he did give Amad one despite a contact (never a penalty I’ll agree). But it’s not like the home fans are intimidating they only know how to sing their own name. He was given his orders. There were some positives for United to take in the first half but didn’t deserve to lose to Kavanagh FC.\nAnthony",

      "State of officiating in this league. Embarrassing.\nGarey Vance, MUFC",
      "",
      "United/Chelsea combined XI…\nI always enjoy the combined XI’s, so thought I would have a stab at United vs. Chelsea, as I don’t agree with the WhoScored selected team (as the article mentions, some of the ratings don’t pass the eye test). I’m also going to a 4 2 3 1 formation because it works for me on Football Manager and therefore is right.",
      "GK: I’m going to give Onana the nod, mainly due to bias, but if I was being a prick and not admitting to my bias, I’d probably make some vague claims about his form for Ajax and Inter and a loose point about United’s defence being an absolute shower of clowns",
      "RB: Mazraoui gets in because he has been an excellent addition, the sort of which we don’t make nearly enough of these days. A fully fit and in form James would obviously start, but as with Shaw at LB, this simply hasn’t been the case often enough",
      "CB: I haven’t watched much of Chalobeh so will just assume that F365 are right in saying he has been strong since coming in to the side",
      "CB: If I could stick VAR here I would as it seems to be the best hope of not conceding (certainly for United), but since we haven’t fully moved to AI yet, I’ll stick with Tosin",
      "LC: Would love to say Shaw but Cucarella has clearly been better this season, so he starts",
      "DM: I’m honestly quite pleased for Caicedo, purchased for crazy money and hounded for that, but has been strong for most of this season",
      "CM: Bruno, can do everything. Also very likely the captain",
      "AM: Palmer has had a difficult second half of the season, but is a certain starter in my team (also a Manc which gives him bonus points)",
      "RW: Amad has really come on this season when given a chance, and I am firmly of the opinion that in a half decent side he would be even better",
      "LW: Probably my bias again but I’m going with Garnacho (cannot understand why some United fans want him gone – frustrating sure, but capable of magic)",

If I misread that then apologies.",
      "Should Man U celebrate the Europa League with a parade? Of course they f***ing should. It’s a trophy! The whole point of the sport is to win trophies. Parades are also excellent for the city and businesses within it, the fact earthworm Jim doesn’t want to have one further exemplifies what a sh*t businessman he is that he doesn’t recognise it’s good for PR. Good for brand. Good for his business and local business and also brings some Levity to what has been a rough season for the Manchester tarts.",
      "That shouldnt be even the slightest bit controversial. You can both celebrate a trophy while also addressing the failings in the league.",
      "Second hot topic since United are in the final is whether it’s fair or not for a team finishing outside European qualifications to then get it for winning a trophy. Would Wenger et al also argue Palace shouldn’t get in Europe if they win the FA Cup? Or how about Seville when they won it and finished 12th that year? Or do these silly rules only apply to clubs we don’t like?",
      "I actually think cup wins should be given better access to Europe. It’s silly that 4th place gets a place in the Champions League but the team who wins the FA Cup doesn’t. All trophy wins should be rewarded with European football.",
      "FA Cup = CL\nLeague cup = Europa\nEuropa = champs league\nConference league = Europa",
      "Winning trophies should always be more valuable than finishing 2nd or below. It’s crazy we currently don’t think it is.",
      "I genuinely think this change would be great as it would motivate absolutely everyone to take them seriously and stop moaning about fixture congestion. It also makes those trophies more prestigious again and provides the winners with a financial bonanza because the £2m that the FA cup currently rewards isn’t even a months gate receipts for a top 10 club. It would also mean that more actual champions are in the champions league.",
      "If you think finishing 4th should be better rewarded than winning a trophy I think you miss the point of football. This season 5th place will get in..5TH! some of the other leagues in Europe don’t even get in if they win their league and we have 5th place getting in?",
      "Wenger has a lot of ideas I agree with, but that isn’t one of them. I’ll take his keepers concede a corner when they time waste though, that’s an excellent rule.\nLee",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n👉 Forget Newcastle and even possibly Spurs; the best ‘overdue silverware’ story would be Crystal Palace\n👉 ‘Arrogant’ Arsenal star, five Man Utd flops, only one Spurs man in ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of 2024/25\n👉 Six Leverkusen standouts reassigned post-Alonso to Real Madrid with Liverpool given two signings",

      "C, it’s not self imposed misery. If you’ve ever read the mailbox, you’ll know that I, and every United fan I’ve ever met, care more about and enjoy a cup final win over something accountants care about like the top 4 trophy. Something you can actually remember and celebrate.",
      "Few reminisce 5 years down the line over that run to 4th if you don’t win the Champions League next year (only Liverpool have ever done that, maybe Chelsea too, no time to look) or if it is something you have done before and are reasonably expected to do. Winning a trophy is an amazing memory no matter how small – the day out, the one-off emotions of it all, the party afterwards, that’s what football is all about. That doesn’t always warrant an open bus top parade that shuts down a city though, and really it shouldn’t. Funnily enough, the hardest places to get permission are Manchester and London, go figure.",
      "Also all teams and councils aren’t the same, it comes down to relativity. United basically won trophies every single year, you have to apply to the council to have a parade and that comes with implications. So in their pomp, United only have parades for major trophies (Prem and Champs), since then, they’ve maintained that. It doesn’t mean there aren’t major fan celebrations in other forms, just not a parade that shuts down a city, requires policing, logistics with local authorities, road closures, permissions from businesses that require access, safety concerns, ambulances assigned, etc. Hopefully you get the point.",
      "Newcastle never win sh*t, Leeds and other teams likewise, so shutting down the city once every 25-100 years for a parade makes sense. In Manchester, there would be parades every single year with varying levels of interest/disinterest – look at City’s ‘turn-out’ for a treble lol.",
      "West Ham had a parade for the Intertoto cup, Portsmouth had a parade and were roundly mocked for reaching the FA cup final, Cardiff for finishing 2nd…. mocked, mocked, mocked. I’m sure United headlines would be full of capitalised EMBARRASSMENT and SHAME if they had a parade.",
      "I must repeat and emphasize without sounding rude, I’m guessing your fandom is online only – Many celebrations happen in the city for trophy wins, just not an open-top parade that shuts the city down…. no one is miserable after a win. Hope that clears things up.",
      "Now, name the lamest reason for a parade that anyone can remember – it’s West Ham btw.",

      "Late offsides…\nA few thoughts on the ‘late offsides’ debate. I find this gets an unwarranted amount of airtime so I’ll give it some more",
      "It seems like the numerous proponents of this argument have been desperate for an injury in the few seconds of ‘meaningless play’ preceding a late flag that occur in most games to prove their point. It has now finally happened after a mere 5 years and nearly 2000 games of Premier League football demonstrating the likelihood of injury in this phase of play is extremely low.",
      "During this time there have been multiple other serious injuries some of which could have no doubt been avoided through more consistent refereeing of dangerous tackles and violent conduct or a reduction in the fixture burden. These seem like much more pressing issues.",
      "It would be very difficult to introduce a rule whereby the flag is raised for obvious offsides. In the Villa PSG game, Shearer was moaning about the flag going up late when Dembele went through, but went silent when the replays showed he was actually on. Even in the game in question, the offside looked more obviously than it was because elanga was almost at full pace and the defender was stepping up. If the ball was released a couple of milli-seconds earlier it would have been on.",
      "It would also create an imbalance whereby VAR is able to correct situations when the flag should have gone up but not when the flag went up but shouldn’t have for the most obvious errors, leading to less goals.",
      "Finally, the whole concept of a ‘meaningless period’ of play is a bit philosophical and hindsight driven. Most of the play in football is meaningless when you know what happens next. Towards the end of the season some entire games are meaningless and indeed some clubs have been meaningless throughout their entire history (Spurs). Why do people get so worked up by the max 5-10 seconds per game from late offside flags?\nWill AFC",
      "",
      "Time for a change…\nHere’s a wild idea for a Thursday afternoon that will grow the English game to new heights – Champions League playoffs. Hear me out.",
      "As someone who has never been comfortable with the idea of the Champions League containing teams who finished second, let alone fifth – these are not “Champions” people – I’ve always thought at least one of the additional spaced should be given to our domestic cup winners. That really would bring back the magic of the FA Cup and/or give the League Cup some relevance it’s never really had. Everyone always objects to this for perfectly good reasons, though often this boils down to “my team always finished in the top four so why should I vote for that?”. Arsenal fans basically.",
      "However, with every additional spot, the Premier League gets for the Champions League, the whole thing is becoming more and more that European Super League that we all said we definitely didn’t want (big fan of the new format though). Even with United and Spurs threatening not to compete in any sort of European football next season, they’ve both blundered their way to a final chance to win Big Cup next year. We need to do something about this nonsense.",
      "And then we have the everlasting spectre of playing meaningful games abroad. We don’t want it but the money men certainly do. Give them the Community Shield I used to say.",
      "Until now.",
      "What i propose, is that in the seasons where England gets a fifth Champions League spot, an end of season tournament is held to decide who gets it. Four teams vying for the same thing Arsenal win nearly every year without any actual hardware to show for it. In fact let’s lay a trophy on the line as well. (To be designed by the mailbox, naturally).",
      "To qualify, you must win the FA Cup, the League Cup or finish 5th or 6th. If the FA Cup or League Cup winners are in the top four then it’s extended to 7th. If both are in the top four then 8th gets a go too.",
      "As an example, if City win the FA Cup, this year’s playoffs would currently include Chelsea, Aston Villa, Forest and Brentford, Brentford beating Forest 4-0 in the final. Tell me that doesn’t sound like fun? This would give us 5 champions – Liverpool, Newcastle (league cup), City (FA Cup), Brentford (5th Place trophy) and Spurs (Europa League – United becoming #1 banter club in the process) – and Arsenal (trophyless but definitely “THE BEST TEAM” qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "This also gives Palace more incentive to beat City in the Cup Final (cos they need more apparently) and replace Brentford in the Fifth place trophy playoffs. Imagine the live feed to Brian Mbeumo’s living room (he’s got the whole team round to watch obviously) as Palace score two last minute goals to get a come from behind win against City. Gutted. You’ve also got Fulham in 11th with a chance of grabbing that final spot off Brentford in the next two weeks. It’s magic.",
      "And finally, we can do all this abroad to shut everyone up about the 39th game. It’s basically meaningless but also potentially transformative for a side that wins it so might just hit the sweet spot and be acceptable to English Fans.",
      "It’s amazing. I’m surprised no one’s thought of it already!",
      "I mean it’s definitely more interesting than what happens now though I suppose it provides another backdoor into the Champions League for underperforming clubs. It also adds games to an overcrowded football schedule. And it’s bad for the planet.",
      "I guess what I really want is for UEFA to limit Champions League entry to League winners, reinstate the Cup Winners Cup and let everyone else fight it out in the Europa League. But somehow my other idea seems more likely. It’s probably not an original idea but if it is I want 10% of the revenue generated by it.\nAshmundo (UPTFR)",
      "",
      "Goodbye Goodison…\nSad to see another of the great grounds depart. Between Highbury, WHL, Upton Park, The Dell and Maine Road…and Roker Park, the Baseball Ground…these stadia all had something so unique, and despite Spurs seemingly having done what many of the others failed, in retaining a sense of the old ground – just on steroids – the fans of all those teams I have spoken to, all miss the old ground, and would happily return to their old homes.",
      "The reasons for moving are all sound, but there will always be something hollow in the new stadium.",
      "Misty eyed nostalgia? Sure. I mean, I don’t miss being crammed into a toilet splashing around in piss, or the jostling queue for a warm plastic bottle of Carslberg, but the echoes of glory (and failure) can’t be recaptured.",
      "So, to Evertonians, good luck in the new gaff but I promise you, you’ll never feel about it the way you do Goodison Park.\nDan",

      "People do watch women’s football… \nI saw ATG’s mail this morning asking whether any men watch the women’s game, and I wanted to chime in—because I absolutely do. I follow the Chelsea Women just as closely as the men’s team, and what a season it has been under Sonia Bompastor. An unbeaten WSL campaign, multiple records shattered, and now a shot at completing a domestic treble in this weekend’s FA Cup Final.",
      "From what I’ve seen when attending matches, there’s a strong presence of male fans in the stands—but what really stands out is the number of families. The atmosphere is less hostile than the men’s games, making it a more welcoming and enjoyable experience for people of all ages. The ticket prices are also far more accessible, which certainly helps when bringing the whole family along.",
      "Personally, I’ve seen the women’s game grow dramatically in both audience and quality in recent years. If you haven’t yet, I really encourage all football fans to watch their women’s team, support them, and if possible, attend a match in person.\nThe Admin @ At The Bridge Pod"

      "It was pretty clear after 13 minutes at Stamford Bridge that things weren’t going to plan. This Manchester United team had been in the ascendency to such a degree that Chelsea had lost all sense of themselves, leading Robert Sanchez to wave the players forward from a free-kick deep in the Blues half before booting it in the general direction of the helpless Tyrique George. There’s nothing Enzo Maresca hates more.",
      "When Harry Maguire volleyed in Bruno Fernandes’ cross, before they were handed a VAR reprieve for the most marginal of offsides, the Chelsea players resembled England vs Iceland at Euro 2016: anxious; confused; shellshocked. And they were playing the football to match.",
      "We lost count of the number of missed passes, while simply controlling the ball appeared to require extraordinary levels of concentration. Aside from an early fluff from Noni Madueke, which would probably have been ruled out for offside had he scored in any case, and a stunning effort from Reece James from outside the box which clipped the post, Chelsea offered very little against a side proven to wilt under the slightest pressure.",

      "A bit like Spurs, who were relatively solid at Villa Park until they weren’t.",
      "An unchallenged Watkins headed John McGinn’s deep corner towards goal for the unchallenged Ezri Konsa to sweep the ball home, and there was no hope (not that they cared) from that point on for Spurs, who were fortunate to concede just once more, with Boubacar Kamara cutting inside to fire into the bottom corner and ramp the pressure up on Chelsea, where the unease swept from the silent stands onto the pitch.",
      "They were again fortunate not to go behind at the start of the second half, as turncoat Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes both missed decent chances after linking up with Amad Diallo.",
      "There was no urgency from Chelsea and, Moises Caicedo aside, a stunning lack of forward thrust from a side in desperate need of a goal but with no apparent method of scoring one. The impact of George playing out of position as the No.9 paled in comparison to the suspended Nicolas Jackson, who’s a long way from perfect and an absolute fool for getting sent off against Newcastle, but is a handful for defenders even at his worst.",
      "Chelsea relied upon the only player to provide a moment of quality in the first half to come up trumps in the second. It was brilliant from James, who unsurprisingly impressed throughout at right-back because he’s a brilliant right-back and not a central midfielder, no matter how much Enzo Maresca tries to convince us he is.",
      "Space opened up for the captain on the edge of the box for a shot, but instead of taking it on with his left, he pirouetted onto his right and as everyone expected him to let fly he clipped the ball delightfully to the back post for Marc Cucurella, who extended his lead as Chelsea’s top scorer in 2025 with his fifth goal this year.",
      "Helped by an understandably meek Manchester United, whose focus had well and truly turned to Wednesday as Amorim rang the changes after going behind, Chelsea saw the game out comfortably, with some very welcome passion displayed by the players, manager and fans that was absent for 70 minutes here and all too often in a run that had seen them slip from the Champions League places.",
      "Only briefly though. James’ goal means Chelsea are fourth, level on points with Newcastle in third and Aston Villa in fifth, as Manchester City slip intriguingly out of the qualification spots ahead of the FA Cup final and their Premier League game in hand on Tuesday against Bournemouth.",

      "It is the time in the season to start thinking about Premier League prize money. Arsenal missed out on not only the title but a record payout last campaign.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was £3.1m per position in 2022/23 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2023/24, Arsenal had 31 games televised in the UK, for which they received £26.9m in facility fees. Liverpool had 29 matches and were paid £25.2m, while Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs (all 28 games) were given £24.4m each.",
      "Burnley were shown on the fewest occasions and received £9.3m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",
      "Spurs in 5th (£164.6m) were paid more overall than Villa in 4th (£162.4m), while 8th-placed Manchester United (£156.2m) took home more than 7th-placed Newcastle (£154.7m).",

      "Manchester City and Chelsea somehow escape unscathed, while Liverpool – predictably – have no representatives in the ‘Big Eight’ Premier League Worst XI of the season; Manchester United have five.",
      "To keep things fair, this team only includes players who’ve made at least 20 appearances and 10 starts in the Premier League this season. Match ratings come via WhoScored, so don’t blame us — blame the algorithm.",
      "",
      "GK: Andre Onana (Manchester United) – 6.52\nEvery goalkeeper has a clanger in them – it comes with the territory when you’re playing in the most high-risk position on the pitch. But this is a particularly erratic bunch. Robert Sanchez, Guglielmo Vicario and Onana have all been walking VAR checks at times, while Emiliano Martinez, Ederson and Nick Pope aren’t exactly bastions of reliability either. Even David Raya and Alisson have had wobbles, though they’re clearly less error-prone than the rest.",
      "The algorithm has Onana rock bottom of the lot, and it’s hard to argue. Four errors leading to a shot and three leading directly to goals in the Premier League – plus a bizarre knack for making himself look smaller in his goal – make him a prime candidate to be replaced. If United had a bigger budget, Ruben Amorim would surely axe him.",
      "",
      "RB: Archie Gray (Spurs) – 6.17\nWe do feel for young Archie Gray. He’s filled in at right-back, centre-back and left-back in an injury-ravaged Spurs side, with the occasional reward of a cameo in midfield – his actual position.",
      "It’s been a turbulent season for Ange Postecoglou and his squad, and the algorithm has picked out Gray as the scapegoat, somehow making him the only Spurs player in the ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of the season.",
      "Clocking up 1,563 Premier League minutes is no small feat, but playing here, there and everywhere, rarely in his natural role, probably isn’t doing wonders for his development.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.33\nAnother teenager enduring a bruising introduction to Premier League life. Leny Yoro’s debut season has been littered with injury setbacks, and limping off against West Ham on Sunday now puts his Europa League final place in doubt.",
      "That would be a fitting end to a stop-start campaign. United were warned about his fitness record before splashing £52million on him from Lille last summer. A metatarsal injury in just his second appearance ruled him out for months, and he didn’t make his Premier League debut until December 4.",
      "There’s clearly loads of potential – no-one’s disputing that – and it’s been a brutal year for just about everyone at Old Trafford. But this has been far from the ideal start for the 19-year-old in particular.",
      "",
      "CB: Pau Torres (Aston Villa) – 6.41\nA bit of experience at the back, but not quite the calming influence Aston Villa hoped for. Pau Torres looked a smart signing after arriving from Villarreal in July 2023, settling quickly into Unai Emery’s system. But things have unravelled somewhat in 2024/25.",
      "Villa’s January-February wobble – one win in seven with Torres injured – seemed to underline his importance. But since returning to fitness, he’s played in just four of their last eight games, all wins, and isn’t looking quite as undroppable as he once did.",
      "With calls for Tyrone Mings to get the nod over him, Torres suddenly feels more like a rotation option than a defensive cornerstone.",
      "",
      "LB: Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – 6.41\nJamie Carragher compared him to Wayne Rooney and Jude Bellingham, praising his “football arrogance” – and it’s been a pretty spectacular breakthrough season for Myles Lewis-Skelly. But two red cards have dragged down his average rating enough to sneak him into this back four.",

      "The lack of consistent starts has dragged down his average rating, and Willock ends up with the second-lowest score in this XI – only Gray has fared statistically worse.",

      "It’s been a miserable season all round, but United could still salvage something by beating Eriksen’s former club, Spurs, in next Wednesday’s Europa League final. He’s unlikely to start that one, which means he’ll probably get run-outs against Chelsea and Aston Villa in the final two league games – in a last-gasp attempt to bump his average rating and escape this team. Because obviously, that’s what he really cares about.",
      "",
      "RW: Leon Bailey (Aston Villa) – 6.42\nIn 23 Premier League appearances this season, Leon Bailey has managed a meagre one goal and two assists – and picked up more yellow cards (three) than either.",
      "Injuries continue to hamper the Jamaican, who took a step forward last term but hasn’t kicked on this time around. Villa have coped well without him, and with Marcus Rashford likely to leave, Donyell Malen looks set to leapfrog Bailey in Unai Emery’s pecking order – alongside Jacob Ramsey and Morgan Rogers.",

      "AM: Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United) – 6.32\nSigned from Bologna last summer to ease the burden on Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee looked an instant hit when he scored the winner on his debut against Fulham – but that was the high point for the Dutchman.",
      "The big question remains: where is his best position? It could be attacking midfield, up front, or maybe he’s destined for a Joelinton-style reinvention as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Rather than seeing this as a problem, Amorim might do well to view Zirkzee’s versatility as a genuine opportunity.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) – 6.43\nVilla might feel hard done by having three players in this worst XI, but hey, life isn’t fair, and the algorithm doesn’t lie.",
      "Ramsey’s red card against Bournemouth last weekend didn’t do his average rating any favours, helping land him a spot in this unfortunate XI after making the worst team of the weekend.",
      "With one goal and five assists from 28 Premier League games in 2024/25, it’s a disappointing return for a player with top talent. Still, at 23, he’s one of the brightest young talents in Emery’s squad.",
      "",
      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United) – 6.27\nIt’s hard to say anything about Hojlund that hasn’t already been said – the young Dane frustrates United fans every week, doing everything possible to make his £70m price tag feel like yet another colossal transfer disaster at Old Trafford.",
      "In 30 Premier League appearances this season, he’s managed a miserable four goals. Whatever excuses you want to make for United’s struggles or his age, that return is nowhere near good enough for a striker who cost so much.",

      "There has been a ‘huge twist’ in the future of Marcus Rashford, with Manchester United facing a ‘£60m loss’ after another ‘staggering blow’ financially.",
      "",
      "Rat race\n‘Ratcliffe loses £6.5 BILLION of total wealth in staggering blow for Man Utd and manager Amorim’s ambitious summer transfer plans,’ is a headline worthy of topping the Daily Mirror website on any day, so unequivocal it is in underlining just how financially screwed one of the world’s biggest clubs is.",
      "It is a ‘staggering blow’ and Ruben Amorim might as well throw his transfer ideas out of a window which is probably about to be made redundant.",
      "‘Ratcliffe was ranked fourth in the 2024 list and topped the standings in 2018,’ writes Senior Sports Reporter Fasika Zelealem. ‘But he has now fallen to become the seventh-richest individual in Britain, behind the likes of Sir James Dyson and Gopi Hinduja and family, who sits atop the list.’",
      "Christ. How embarrassing for Sir Jim to trail Sir James and only five other unthinkably rich people in Britain. There’ll be no Matheus Cunha then; I’ll tell the children.",
      "Ratcliffe wasn’t even in the top ten in 2021 or 2022 but this will undoubtedly bring shame upon his entire family.",
      "‘The INEOS chief, who competed a deal to buy into United last year, was worth £23.519billion in the 2024 Rich List. However, that has now decreased by £6.473bn to £17.046bn.’",
      "There goes the Europa-winning BBQ. Although it does feel like a clue to explain some of those losses might be found in the sentence ‘the INEOS chief, who competed a deal to buy into United last year…’.",
      "Maybe don’t wait up for a response.",
      "Is there any insight whatsoever into how this ‘staggering blow’ stands to ruin Ruben Amorim’s ‘ambitious summer transfer plans’? Of course not. Ratcliffe, the owner of 28.94% of Manchester United, and whose individual net worth remains about on par with that of Manchester City’s owners, will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "Reach the plummet\n‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe suffers a 10-figure loss in his fortune as Man United’s billionaire co-owner plummets down rich list after costly first year in charge,’ is how the MailOnline describe a fall from fourth to seventh.",
      "",
      "At a loss for words\nThere is further dreadful fiscal news for Manchester United from the Daily Mirror website as they ‘could take a £60million loss on Marcus Rashford in the space of a year’.",
      "Except valuing a player they absolutely didn’t want to sell at £100m in April 2024 and valuing a player they absolutely do want to sell at £40m in May 2025 is not really a ‘£60million loss’, is it? Especially in a pure profit sense.",
      "",
      "Rash decision\nThe Rashford stuff on Friday morning is funny as numerous outlets have parroted the same line fed to them about Rashford being available for £40m this summer.",
      "They all also seem desperate to wilfully misunderstand the point of a buy option, which it was widely reported Villa had when they loaned him.",
      "‘Marcus Rashford could move for £40m to a team other than Aston Villa should Manchester United receive a bid of this value despite the Midlands club having an option to buy him for that sum’ – Jamie Jackson, The Guardian.",

No-one thought they had secured an obligation to buy or even first refusal on a deal for Rashford because that was never reported on or even vaguely alluded to at any point whatsoever over the last three months.",
      "So no, Villa do not have something no-one ever thought they did. Thanks for that. They also don’t have an obligation to buy Marco Asensio for £427m. Is that how this works?",
      "It’s just a bizarre non-update, typified by this nonsense Daily Mirror website headline:",
      "‘Manchester United name price for Marcus Rashford but summer exit takes huge twist’",
      "Manchester United named their price when Villa negotiated a £40m buy option in February. And that ‘huge twist’ is that said buy option is not a first option or indeed anything other than the sodding buy option everyone thought it was and has been told it was for months.",
      "Yet only now ‘it has emerged Villa do not have first option on the 27-year-old’? Do we need to be told everything privately by Rashford’s representatives for it to ’emerge’ now, no matter how obvious it was before?",

      "",
      "GK: Robert Sanchez (Chelsea) – 6.58\nDebates like Sanchez vs Andre Onana are exactly why we copped out with the WhoScored rating process. Both are error-prone but capable of world-class acrobatics. Unfortunately, the errors feel more frequent these days.",
      "What Onana does have over Sanchez is continuity: he’s United’s undisputed No.1, thanks in no small part to Altay Bayindir being extremely dodgy. Sanchez has rotated with Filip Jorgensen but has been Chelsea’s first choice for most of the league season. He should start on Friday, but a Europa Conference League final starting berth is up for grabs.",
      "",
      "RB: Noussair Mazraoui (Manchester United) – 6.79\nA rare bit of solid recruitment from United, Mazraoui has been quietly reliable since arriving from Bayern Munich for a measly £15m. He’s featured at right-back, left-back and as a wide centre-back in Ruben Amorim’s three-man defence, as well as in attacking midfielder under Erik ten Hag.",
      "He looked more comfortable in a back four for Ten Hag but has still been one of Amorim’s most consistent players. He gets in ahead of Reece James, who’s mostly been used off the bench as Enzo Maresca carefully manages his fitness.",
      "",
      "CB: Tosin Adarabioyo (Chelsea) – 6.67\nAnnoyingly, Tosin’s rating is 0.02 better than Trevoh Chalobah’s, who has formed a solid and settled partnership with Levi Colwill in the latter half of the season. If this was opinion-based, Chalobah would be in.",
      "Still, Tosin – signed on a free from Fulham – has started 13 league games and been a regular in the cups, including 10 of Chelsea’s 12 Conference League fixtures. A shrewd bit of business.",
      "",
      "CB: Levi Colwill (Chelsea) – 6.70\nThe highest-rated options were actually Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez, but the former has only played two league games and the latter’s been out since February with an ACL injury.",
      "Colwill, meanwhile, has been a mainstay for Chelsea, starting 33 of their 36 league matches.",
      "",
      "LB: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United) – 6.84\nDalot has been hit-and-miss under Amorim but the algorithm hasn’t minded too much. He just edges out Marc Cucurella (6.63). Often shuffled around, he’s spent some time at left-back and just about gets the nod here.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Chelsea) – 7.02\nCaicedo has recently been filling in at right-back while Romeo Lavia partners Enzo Fernandez in midfield, but we’re picking players in their natural positions for this XI.",
      "The Ecuadorian has quietly been Chelsea’s most consistent performer this season, and the £105m price tag has stopped being a stick to beat him with — which is always a good sign. He also scored a belter at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture.",
      "",
      "CM: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – 7.20\nUnited’s best player by an absurd distance. Fernandes has been excellent despite the circus around him. Without him, United might have exited Europe months earlier and ended up scrapping with the bottom three.",
      "",
      "RW: Amad Diallo (Manchester United) – 7.17\nFully fit and finding form at the right time. A shame Ten Hag didn’t trust him — might still have a job if he had.",
      "Amorim has recognised Amad’s talent immediately, and the former Sunderland and Rangers loanee has flourished in the 3-4-3 as one of the two wide No.10s.",
      "",
      "AM: Cole Palmer (Chelsea) – 7.35\nThe chippy chips connoisseur ended a ludicrous 18-game goal drought recently, but still has 15 goals and eight assists in 35 league appearances, which tells you how ridiculous his first half of the season was.",
      "He bagged a hat-trick against United at Stamford Bridge last season and will hope to torment them again as Chelsea chase a top-five finish.",
      "",
      "LW: Pedro Neto (Chelsea) – 6.78\nPlenty of wide options, all underwhelming.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s ineligible and wouldn’t start anyway, Mykhaylo Mudryk is still suspended after that failed drugs test, and Alejandro Garnacho is wildly inconsistent. Neto might not be setting the world alight, but he’s probably the best of an unconvincing bunch.",

      "If you can’t enjoy the journey to the top of football there really is no point. If the prem/champions league is the minimum why even have parades then? You should be winning trebles etc.. Treating football like a business where you can only celebrate hitting these benchmarks is just sad. Supporting a football club is not something you must do, why volunteer yourself for this and then treat victories like they’re actually not a good thing.",
      "Maybe I’d understand if it’s below expectations, like if City won the europa league, but United have now been utterly wank (by their lofty standards) for half of the current millenium. I hate United but still think their fans should enjoy a win, also hate Leeds but the parade they had for promotion looked great. I recently was at a Panachaiki (Patras) game where they managed to secure survival in the Greek second tier, hardly the zenith of football but all the locals who’ve watched their team continuously worsen over the past 20 years were having a great time (They’ve since been relegated for financial reasons but oh well). I’ve seen others point out they would be mocked for having a parade, who cares? Maybe this has only really risen with social media, but I cannot think of anything more insecure than not celebrating in case Ty from AFTV calls you a loser.",
      "Also agree totally with Lee (LFC) about Ratcliffe’s self made nonsense and what he forgot to include is when these massive corporations buyout struggling companies, they typically take out big loans, the debt from which is then saddled onto the struggling company they now own so said struggling company also has to pay off the loan used to buy them, as well as a variety of fees from their new owners (Which they avoid tax on!). Recent victims of this are the American institution of Hooters. So it’s not quite the self made noble story some would have you believe.\nC, Greece",

It would certainly liven things up. One of the joys of the playoffs is that a team can be way off it and still nip in to the final place.Stockport were 10 points better off than us (and it showed, quite often) and yet we’re the ones going to wembley.

      "Late offsides and how to fix them\nI was fortunate enough to have an e-mail published in March’s mailbox about pet peeves, one of which was offside flags being given late for VAR to have the final say.  At the time, I wrote:",
      "Who’s going to admit culpability when a player inevitably gets injured in a “phase of play” that should never have been allowed to continue because an offside wasn’t given in time?",
      "And now, here we are with Taiwo Awoniyi (who I wish a speedy recovery, and I’m sure everyone else does as well).  I sit by a fellow season ticket holder in the Holte End who loses his shit every match when the assistant referee puts the flag up for offside about 2 minutes too late and I remind him every time that “it’s not his/her fault, they’re just doing what they’ve been told to do”.",
      "No amount of evidence or argument will convince me that this rule is a good one – it’s absolutely pointless and basically says VAR has the final say.  If that’s the case, we might as well do away with assistant referees altogether because the only other thing they have to do is flag for fouls or direct which way a throw in is given, with most of those decisions resulting in said assistant referee either not giving it at all or looking blankly at the actual referee waiting for them to give it! (Obviously not a serious suggestion.)",
      "The fix for this is really very, very simple.  If the player is blatantly offside by a considerable visual distance then let the assistant referee put their flag up as they will 99.99% be correct (if they’re not, demote them).  If the player is “close” to being offside to the point where it’s not visually easy to spot, THEN delay the raising of the flag so that VAR can check and confirm afterwards.  Yes, players may still get injured this way but it will be a hell of a lot less than the decisions where they are miles ahead of the last defender.  This makes perfect sense to me and I’d be interested to hear what other readers/commenters think?\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (And whilst we’re at it, keep VAR checks to 30 seconds otherwise the ref’s original call stands as it’s not “clear and obvious”.  You could even pipe the Countdown music out in the stadiums whilst the check is taking place.)",

      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""

      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer. The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and can push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "\"I knew I had space and time. I knew I put the ball in a good area, this guy was always arriving.",
      "\"We've been working the whole season, the message has been clear from the start. Executing it has been hard. Today, what we're trying to do pays off.",
      "\"I feel confident, it's the most I've played in a few seasons. I want to help the team and hope we can finish it in the right way.",
      "\"The Champions League is where the club belongs, competing in the best competitions. People like to write us off and call us young ,but it's an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do to get the three points.\""

      "Friday 16 May 2025 18:45, UK",
      "An \"embarrassed\" Ruben Amorim has claimed there is \"something wrong\" with the way his Manchester United side play football ahead of their meeting with Chelsea, live on Friday Night Football.",
      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",
      "\"We need to feel that. We need to get angry with the critics and perform. The worst thing we can do is let it go, that is so hard to understand.\""

      "Thursday 15 May 2025 23:44, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has played his last game for Aston Villa - for now, at least - after Unai Emery confirmed injury would keep him out against Tottenham. The forward is ineligible to face Manchester United on the final day, so attention now turns to his future.",
      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",
      "It is too close to call with two games to go in the hunt for the top five...",
      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",
      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",
      "Opta's supercomputer has given them a 38 per cent chance of breaking into the Champions League spots.",
      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",
      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",
