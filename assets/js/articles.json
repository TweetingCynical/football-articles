      "Manchester United have launched a new bid for Bryan Mbeumo amid interest from Tottenham and the Red Devils could have a secret weapon to help them seal the deal. Mbeumo starred for Brentford last season, netting 20 Premier League goals as he stepped up and helped fill the void left by Ivan Toney's move to Al-Ahli.",
      "His exploits have attracted attention from a number of clubs, with United and Spurs leading the way. United submitted an improved offer of more than £60million for Mbeumo earlier this week, having seen a bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons already rejected by Brentford.",
      "And the Athletic are now reporting that United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been in contact with Mbeumo about joining the club. The pair are international teammates for Cameroon and are said to have 'spoken about linking up' under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"I think it can be the life of a footballer and you need to accept it. It's been my best season so far in the Premier League. And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.",
      "\"He [Frank] has done so much for me. He literally trusted me from the start. I think he developed the team so well.",
      "\"He developed me as a human and a player as well. So I can only wish him all the best, and I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"I think he knows everything. He's really smart. He knows where he wants to bring the team, how he wants to play. I think he's been fantastic for Brentford.",
      "\"I think he's going to have some time to adapt, obviously. [ Champions League ] games, more expectations, as you said, but I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"He knows how to talk to people. He knows how to build a group. And that's why we've been playing so well.",
      "\"It's big shoes to fill. I think, (Frank had) seven years as a head coach. So, obviously it's going to be changing, but let's see.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is keen on a move to Chelsea this summer, opening the door to a potential eye-catching swap deal with Christopher Nkunku. Manchester United are keen to sell Garnacho in the summer transfer window and Chelsea appear to be the most likely destination.",
      "Garnacho knows he is not in Ruben Amorim’s plans for the 2025/26 campaign, despite returning 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games last season. United will listen to offers for any of their players this summer and the 20-year-old winger could be their most valuable asset as Amorim plots a rebuild.",
      "He attracted interest from Chelsea and Napoli in the January transfer window and the direction of travel was made obvious by the events last month. Garnacho reacted furiously to being left on the bench for the Europa League final and was left out of the squad for United’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season.",
      "It emerged on Monday that Chelsea and United were considering a swap deal involving Garnacho and Nkunku. No direct talks have yet been held, but with both clubs keen to offload the attackers it could be a fruitful avenue.",
      "The Athletic reports that Garnacho would be open to joining Chelsea because he wants to stay in the Premier League and would favour a move to London this summer. The Blues are closing in on the signing of Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens in a deal which could impact a move for Garnacho.",
      "Chelsea have already signed Liam Delap from Ipswich for £30m and decided against signing Jadon Sancho permanently from United.

      "Manchester United have been linked with Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, who has come up against Premier League defenders in the past. The Serbian striker was signed for £60million from Fiorentina in 2022, but could be on his way out of Turin this summer.",
      "Vlahovic, 25, scored 16 goals across all competitions for the Old Lady this season. He has since been touted as a target for United as Juventus reportedly explore a possible swap deal for Jadon Sancho.",
      "The winger is set to enter the final year of his United contract and is not thought to be in manager Ruben Amorim’s plans after his Chelsea loan spell failed to materialise into a permanent move. However, if Vlahovic does join the Premier League as part of a swap deal, he will hope to perform better against England defender Marc Guehi, who is wanted by Liverpool.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has claimed that Juventus are willing to offer players in exchange for Sancho, who is also said to be on Napoli’s radar. Vlahovic has been named as one option and former Aston Villa star Douglas Luiz is said to be another alternative.",
      "Vlahovic has been described as ‘unreceptive’ to previous offers to leave Juventus, having attracted interest from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. However, the chance to lead the line for United could convince the forward.",
      "He has limited experience against English clubs, scoring in a Champions League group stage win over Manchester City in November. However, Vlahovic did line up for Serbia against England in their opening game at Euro 2024, where he endured a tough evening against Guehi.",
      "The centre-back was selected by Gareth Southgate to replace the injured Harry Maguire, despite his relative inexperience at international level. Crystal Palace captain Guehi stepped up to the challenge and appeared composed alongside John Stones as the Three Lions earned a 1-0 win.",
      "Vlahovic, partnered by ex-Fulham forward Aleksandar Mitrovic, barely had a touch in the first-half as England stifled Serbia’s physical front two. It proved to be a landmark performance from Guehi, who has since attracted interest from Liverpool.",
      "The Palace defender is another who is set to enter the last 12 months of his deal after failing to agree to a new contract with Oliver Glasner's side. Reluctant to let one of their prize assets leave for free next year, the FA Cup winners are expected to sell Guehi this summer.",
      "Liverpool have expressed interest in Guehi this summer as they look to bolster their centre-back options. Arne Slot's side are searching for a central defender following Jarell Quasah’s move to Bayer Leverkusen.",

      "Manchester United's summer so far has been a lot of talk but far less action. Ruben Amorim knows he needs a big few months if he is to be a success at Old Trafford.",
      "The less said about last season's Premier League effort the better, but the man in the dugout now has the chance to address any issues and have a full pre-season getting his ideas across. The last few months and their results underlined the need for new faces in Manchester.",
      "Many have been linked but so far only Matheus Cunha has signed. His arrival was made far easier by a release clause that existed in his Wolves contract - although which leaves United paying the cash faster than they would have preferred. However, trying to persuade other clubs to sell up has proved a lot harder.",
      "The Europa League final defeat also means that the Manchester outfit cannot offer European football of any kind, which will deter some players from moving. Already Liam Delap has opted for Chelsea instead of the Red Devils.",
      "Adding more firepower appears to be a priority whilst almost every player on their books is potentially up for sale. Amorim's unique system requires certain players to make it tick and those are the ones he's targeted, whilst he also has a number of big name individuals who needs to have their futures wrapped up.",
      "The likes of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are back in Manchester, but for how long? Alejandro Garnacho is edging closer to the exit door with his potential departure likely to fund their summer business as clubs in the Premier League and abroad weigh up bids.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is currently the main man on United's radar. They've just made another bid, this one worth a total £60million. Brentford are holding out for £65m, wanting a little more that it cost to land Cunha due to him being younger and having scored more than the Brazilian last term, while knowing that Tottenham are also waiting in the wings.",
      "Mbeumo has just enjoyed his best year in front of goal and the Bees have proved that they are a selling club. The disparity between United's bid and Brentford's asking price is minimal, which all points to a deal getting done. The only potential sticking point is the structure of the deal with the west Londoners not wanting instalments.",
      "United though want their man and are unlikely to miss out over such a detail. Amorim wants it done and dusted before pre-season training begins on July 7.",
      "Rashford will soon be back in the building after several months away with Aston Villa. It became clear when Amorim rocked up that he and the England star weren't at all aligned with the United boss claiming he couldn't get the player to see football the way he does.",
      "The forward was impressive whilst at Villa but they haven't exercised their option to sign him for £40m. It leaves Rashford in limbo and whilst he's claimed he could play as a No.9, the transfer activity at Old Trafford suggests they feel they need to improve in that area and will look outside the club, not within, for their options.",
      "But what now for Rashford? Well the dream Barcelona switch looks to be off the cards as they move for Nico Williams of Atletico Madrid instead. They're also taking the Copenhagen kid Ronny Bardghji.",
      "Any suitor who comes in will want him to lower his wages and probably won't want to be paying United anything like they're looking for. But currently there isn't a huge amount of noise regarding a buyer and the player is very much stuck in limbo.",
      "Speaking of outside noise, the talk of Andre Onana leaving Manchester won't go away. The Cameroonian has now spent two years at the club but is yet to convince. The constant errors even saw Amorim drop him for a game last term and Monaco as well as clubs in Saudi Arabia are thought to be keen.",
      "United could therefore be on the lookout for a new goalkeeper and the Emiliano Martinez links continue to persist. The Argentine cut an emotional figure at the end of the season with Villa, many seeing it as possible goodbye. Atletico Madrid are keen but United are also waiting in the wings. Gianluigi Donnarumma, the PSG No.1, is, right now, frankly not going to happen.",
      "Sancho, like Rashford, was out on loan last term but unlike his team-mate a pathway back to Manchester appears a lot less likely. His loan to Chelsea came after he also had a stint back at Borussia Dortmund. Throughout his time at Old Trafford he's rarely looked like a £70m player.",
      "But like so many on the books his wages and the price demands make his exit particularly difficult. Juventus are among those to be linked as are Napoli, but none will be paying £25m plus £350k-a-week. The fee United could get, but they're likely going to need to negotiate a pay-off with Sancho to get him off the books.",
      "Italy could also be the destination for Rasmus Hojlund, who has underwhelmed in his two years with the club. Despite his lack of goals Inter Milan are keen and could offer him a route out of the club, but United won't get anywhere near to recouping the £72m they spent to sign him.",
      "Once tipped as the future of the club, Garnacho has fallen down the pecking order. He's struggled to find a home in Amorim's system and his attitude hasn't endeared him to his manager. He reacted when left out of the team for the Europa League final and an exit now appears to suit all parties - with fans increasingly frustrated by some of his social media antics.",
      "Of all the assets United are likely to sell the Argentine is perhaps the most valuable. He would command a hefty fee and Napoli have been linked. Now Chelsea have come to the party and a swap deal, maybe involving Christopher Nkunku, is a possibility. Wherever he goes Garnacho will either bring in a good amount of cash to re-invest or prove to be a tempting option in a swap.",
      "But the thing is, he's obviously talented, has huge potential, can score goals and is dynamic - things Amorim wants from his attackers. He was a regular for the Portuguese for much of last season, so could he still have a future in Manchester?",
      "It's a decision that still needs to be made - from all sides.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

Brazil international Cunha is a start, while Mbeumo has been earmarked as his 'twin No.10' counterpart in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation. A move for a new central striker has also been earmarked.",

      "Sesko, 22, would cost around £70m which Arsenal are believed to be willing to pay. Contract demands are proving more problematic having exceeded their expectations however."

      "Ruben Amorim’s side have now been told to look elsewhere, specifically on Merseyside. Fernando Lopes, president of Portuguese club Uniao Tires, has suggested that Beto - who used to play for his side - would be an ideal addition.",
      "As quoted by The Sun, Lopes said: \"Everyone thought Amorim would sign Gyokeres as he had him at Sporting, but the Premier League is completely different to Portugal.",
      "\"Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it's quicker and more competitive. Gyokeres would struggle to play as the lone No. 9 waiting for service. Beto's a more physical player, who fights with defenders and doesn't lose duels. He's a real headache for opponents - if he gets the service.",
      "\"In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces, but haven't had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there's an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "\"Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate, plus he's very fast. When [David] Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he's for defenders to stop. He'd be like Amorim's ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.\"",
      "Beto, 27, joined Everton from Italian side Udinese in 2023 for £25m but endured a poor start to life in the Premier League with just three goals across his debut season. But he improved last term having scored 10 goals across all competitions.",
      "Beto is not the only surprise forward that United have been linked with this summer. Former Tottenham star Jamie O’Hara recently suggested that Jamie Vardy would be an ideal addition following his exit from Leicester.",
      "He said: “If you’re a team coming up you’d definitely have a look at him. But I think he can still do a job at an established Premier League club. Couldn’t he do a job at Man United? How many goals has [Rasmus] Hojlund got?",
      "“You can’t tell me he still can’t do a job in the Premier League. As a free transfer, I think he’s a great signing to add to your squad.”",

      "\"Ultimately it was my decision so I kind of just want my head to be clear so not too much. [I've known him] since I was 15, playing at City with him. I've got a good relationship with him so it was nice to see a familiar face.",
      "\"There are so many factors that go into it. I've got a good relationship with the manager. I know how he plays. I've played in this system before. I know a lot of the players here and the project of the club, how they see the future. That's what excited me.\"",
      "Palmer made the move from City to Chelsea and has become one of the first names on the team-sheet. He scored 22 goals and assisted 11 in his first season before netting another 15 and assisting eight in his second campaign.",
      "Delap is hoping to emulate the midfielder by also making a fast start to life in west London, having scored 12 Premier League goals last season.",

      "They have already splashed £62.5m on former Wolves forward and Brazilian international Matheus Cunha. It is hoped that he could be the first attacking addition of the summer as Amorim attempts to solve his side’s goalscoring woes.",
      "And United already have their eyes on a few more. With that being said, take a look at what the starting XI could look like against Arsenal on the opening day of next season:",

      "And should he be allowed to leave, United could move for Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma, who sees his contract expire in a year. He has already reportedly been discussing a move to the Premier League with his Italian colleagues.",
      "While United committed to a significant outlay last term in signing Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt to bolster their defence, there could yet be more signings. Youngster Diego Leon is on the way, while it has been reported that Sporting Lisbon star Ousmane Diomande is keen on being reunited with Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Who else should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below",

Should Diomande be signed, he could potentially replace Lisandro Martinez in the heart of the defence, with the Argentine expected to be sidelined until September. Patrick Dorgu should retain his position at left wing-back, but it'll be interesting to see if its Diogo Dalot or Amad on the right moving forwards.",
      "Moving into midfield, the Red Devils’ line-up seems pretty well set. Last summer’s signing Manuel Ugarte should do enough to usurp Casemiro, while captain Bruno Fernandes is a near guarantee to start after spurning interest from Saudi Arabia. Given Christian Eriksen has departed, another signing in midfield might be useful but not crucial.",

They could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund, who have both been linked with moves to Italy.",

Normally, it is strictly Louis Vuitton gear, the top-and-shorts number in another holiday snap retailing at a couple of grand.",
      "And in the shot which features Garnacho in a replica Rashford shirt that seems to have offended many, the United player is flanked by two cars. According to a couple of petrol-head mates, one appears to be a Ferrari Portofino and the other a Lamborghini Urus.",
      "Whatever the models, one thing is for sure, there’s a good half a million pounds worth of motor there. Professional footballers enjoying and showing the conspicuous rewards of considerable wealth is hardly exceptional. It is commonplace.",

      "But, rightly or wrongly, the reason why the picture of Garnacho in a Villa-Rashford shirt with a pair of super-cars might jar is that it comes across as a portrait of a superstar who was anything other than a superstar last season. Garnacho was not United’s worst player, far from it.",
      "And for what it is worth, Ruben Amorim’s decision not to start him in the Europa League final was not a good one. But Garnacho scored six goals and made two assists in 36 appearances in the Premier League last season.",
      "He has eight goals in his last 51 Premier League appearances. There is, without any doubt, a very talented player in Garnacho, as was spectacularly demonstrated by THAT goal at Goodison Park.",
      "But that was in November, 2023, in the early months of a new five-year deal and if Garnacho was a United player rewarded too handsomely too quickly, that would not be unusual. Garnacho wearing a Villa shirt and then publishing the photograph seems a bit silly, more an error of judgement rather than a heinous crime.",
      "Don’t forget, this is a player who, apparently, has been told to find another club. As cool as he looks, prospective suitors might not be overly impressed with Garnacho’s social media picture gallery.",
      "There will be no public admonishment of Garnacho from United as that would probably be counter-productive. If they really do want to sell, they will want top dollar for a young player who still has buckets of potential.",

      "Manchester United remain in the hunt for Bryan Mbeumo but Brentford's transfer demands could complicate matters - with Tottenham waiting in the wings. The north Londoners have joined the race after hiring Thomas Frank.",
      "Mbeumo has just enjoyed his best season to date, scoring 20 times for the Bees, and that has seen interest in him mount. United are in the market for more firepower this summer but saw their opening offer worth £45million plus £10m in add-ons at the start of June rejected.",
      "United are preparing a fresh offer for the Cameroon star but Brentford have made it clear that they want the bulk of Mbeumo's fee to be paid up front, reports the Evening Standard. They do not want to sanction his exit based on a number of instalments over several years.",
      "That could hamper the plans at Old Trafford with the Red Devils hoping to pay for Mbeumo gradually if they were successful with a bid. Brentford want a fee similar to the one the £62.5m that saw Matheus Cunha join United from Wolves only weeks ago.",
      "Even those negotiations caused problems for the Manchester outfit, who must remain compliant with financial rules. They wanted to pay for Cunha over five years before eventually meeting Wolves' terms of three instalments over two seasons.",
      "It all opens the door for Tottenham who beat United in the Europa League final last month and can now offer Champions League football, as they look for a new winger. Mbeumo has been identified as a target as is remains open to joining Tottenham, although a switch to Manchester is thought to be his preference. Tottenham have also lined up Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo as a possible target.",
      "Brentford are more than happy for a bidding war to commence as they look to maximise their profit on a player they signed as an unknown quantity back when they were in the Championship.",
      "Frank was the man who brought Mbeumo to England as a teenager in 2019 and the pair enjoy a close relationship having been part of the journey that took Brentford from the Championship to the Premier League before consolidating them as a top flight side across the following four seasons.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants to address several areas of his squad this summer but Cunha is the only man to arrive through the door. Liam Delap was a target but the striker opted to move to Chelsea instead. The Red Devils could yet pursue Viktor Gyokeres, who worked under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",

      "A potential swap deal that would see Manchester United part ways with Jadon Sancho and welcome Dusan Vlahovic could be on the cards.",
      "The Englishman is expected to be sold this summer after spending the entirety of last season on loan to Chelsea, where he won the UEFA Conference League. Sancho's last game so far for the Red Devils came in the Community Shield last year, with his likely sale putting an end to what has been a hugely disappointing period for both parties.",
      "Among the possibilities of his possible departure is the 25-year-old leaving English football to join Juventus in exchange for the Serbian striker. Vlahovic, who was a prior target for Arsenal, has largely played a bench role at the Italian giants since the loan arrival of Randal Kolo-Muani in January.",
      "Reports in Italy have said that the club are proposing to offer the striker - who has a year left on his contract - in order to capture Sancho, who has 'not let go' of the winger since first registering interest in signing him last year, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "While Vlahovic has maintained a respectable goal-scoring record of 57 goals in 144 games, the 25-year-old has failed to replicate the devastating form in front of goal that he showed during his time at Fiorentina.",
      "He did score 16 goals across all competitions this season, which is just one less than Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed combined. On top of his superiority as a scorer ahead of their forward options, the Premier League giants will certainly be buoyed by reports from Corriere dello Sport that Vlahovic turned down a mammoth offer worth £17million a year from Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr earlier this year.",
      "Not yet in his prime, the decision to remain in a top European league will come as a positive sign to United chiefs about the desire the Serb has to accomplish honours at the highest level rather than taking a cash grab.",
      "A player devoted to his club and team-mates is certainly a sought-after attribute and it's one Vlahovic displayed last season during a trying time for Juventus.",
      "After a fourth consecutive Serie A draw where his side could only muster up a 2-2 draw against Venezia, the Juve players, as per tradition, walked over to the fans under the Curva to thank them for their support.",
      "However, the feeling wasn't mutual. The supporters hurled insults and disrespectful chants at the players, which Vlahovic didn't take too kindly to as he shouted back at the fans. According to Sky Sport Italia, despite the players walking away, the fans continued with the insults, which prompted the striker to turn to them and gesture a sarcastic thumbs-up at them.",
      "While it's never healthy for a player to argue with their own fans, it shows United that Vlahovic isn't afraid to speak his mind and will stand up for his teammates when he feels it is necessary.",
      "Adding such a strong personality to the dressing room could have both positive and negative effects, and Ruben Amorim will no doubt be taking a lot of different factors into consideration as he continues his search for more reinforcements this summer, including a new striker.",
      "Amorim has so far overseen the arrival of one new signing this summer in Matheus Cunha, who they bought for £62.5m from Wolves. While interest remains in Bryan Mbeumo and Viktor Gyokeres, United are said to face competition for the attackers from Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, respectively.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "It was noticeable during Omar Berrada's first summer as Manchester United chief executive that the club never broke the £60million barrier for a signing.",
      "For years, Berrada's former employers at Manchester City privately bragged that they seldom spent more than £60m on a player. Jose Mourinho felt he was on a hiding to nothing against a state-backed club but it was a matter of quality more than quantity with City.",
      "To date, City have spent in excess of that figure on only four players: Rodri, Ruben Dias, Jack Grealish and Josko Gvardiol. Grealish is the sole failure and his best season still coincided with City's treble triumph.",
      "Leny Yoro was United's most expensive acquisition last year for an up front fee of £52.18m. The deal could total £58.91m.",
      "Already this summer, United have crept above the £60m mark for Matheus Cunha, who had a reasonable release clause of £62.5m. Bryan Mbeumo, who outscored Cunha and everyone else in the Premier League bar Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Mohamed Salah, could fetch an identical fee.",
      "That is the going rate for a Premier League-standard forward. Only one of United's five arrivals last year was an attacker and Joshua Zirkzee also had a release clause. He was based in Italy, whose league has been in decline for nearly two decades and has become a dumping ground for English clubs. Ie. not United material but nearly as economical as Jasprit Bumrah's bowling.",
      "Sensibly, United have sought forwards with Premier League pedigree this year. Liam Delap was another they wanted on board and the eventual identity of their new No.9 (to consider Cunha or Mbeumo as one would be a complete cop-out) will be curious as it is unlikely to be a domestic deal.",
      "Before he purged his Twitter account, Berrada revelled in how much United had overpaid for Angel di Maria in 2014. Di Maria, a reigning Champions League winner who had recently helped Argentina to reach the World Cup final, commanded a British-record £59.7m fee.",
      "The problem with Di Maria was not the fee but the fact that he did not want to move to Manchester. United had a free run as Paris Saint-Germain, Di Maria's preferred choice, were out of the running due to financial fair play issues.",
      "Di Maria effectively covered the cost of James Rodriguez, Madrid's vanity signing. They still had change to get Toni Kroos, possibly the bargain of the decade, at £20m.",
      "Ed Woodward had also incepted the United tax by signing Marouane Fellaini for £4.5m more than was necessary in 2013. Back when FFP was not an issue for United and profitability and sustainability rules had not entered the football lexicon, Woodward operated as though spending inflated fees was a sound strategy. Luke Shaw became football's most expensive teenager two months before Di Maria was driven through the barriers at Carrington.",
      "Erik ten Hag aimed high in the Premier League market and the price was not right for United. They were not in the running when Declan Rice was available in 2023, having already earmarked Mason Mount as their central midfield target, and refused to test the waters with Tottenham for Harry Kane.",
      "Those two England internationals cost £187m combined when they moved to Arsenal and Bayern Munich. The negotiations of those deals involved 'big six' clubs, whereas Cunha and Mbeumo are more affordable, having operated outside of the elite, and are not England internationals.",
      "Brentford were looking for between £50m and £60m for Ivan Toney last year until it transpired that no Premier League clubs would meet them at the table. That drove his price down to £40m for Al Ahli. Mbeumo, in contrast, generated interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United and outperformed any of Toney's top-flight campaigns before he decided on United. So he was never going to be as cheap.",
      "£60m is a figure that came to define United's 2023 summer window, one of their worst. Everyone at the club maintained that was the maximum they would pay for Rasmus Hojlund. Eventually, they overpaid with a final package of £72m.",
      "On the eve of the 2024 window, Berrada warned United would be on a \"slippery slope\" if they overpaid clubs, players and agents. Their spending was more disciplined, even if it eventually totalled £206m, but this year it is needs must after United's worst season in 51 years. A little more than £120m for two of the best forwards in the Premier League last season is a statement.",
      "United have made savings through their existence outside of the Champions League. For the third season out of four, players will be on a reduced salary due to their failure to qualify for the competition again.",
      "Two rounds of redundancies and slashing the non-playing workforce by roughly a third have also freed up funds after a decrease of £20m year-on-year on employee benefit expenses. United's net cash inflow of £22.3m during the last quarter was an increase of £7.2m from the same quarter last year.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's remark that United could have gone \"bust\" by Christmas always sounded like scaremongering. PSR has genuinely compromised them (they loaned in Wout Weghorst as Cristiano Ronaldo's mid-season replacement when Cody Gakpo was available), only it was undermined by squandering £625.43m under Ten Hag.",
      "United's market movement under Berrada has been hitherto inoffensive but the greater the price, the greater the scrutiny. And United are now going north of £60m."

      "Their friendly schedule begins in roughly three-and-a-half weeks with another Scandinavian-set friendly against Leeds United. It is their third in six years against their local adversary on foreign turf. It was only three-and-a-half weeks ago that United's post-season tour ended.",
      "Pre-season medicals will be conducted at Carrington in two weeks. Cameramen and photographers are likely to cover both entrances into United's training complex on July 7 in an effort to spot their personas non grata.",
      "Such is the pettiness of Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford it would not be a surprise if either were unaccounted for. Jadon Sancho does not have a squad number and might as well have cleared out his locker nearly two years ago.",

      "Chelsea would rather sign Jamie Gittens, a younger winger who left Manchester City's academy for Borussia Dortmund three years after Sancho. That's how little Chelsea think of Sancho and how far his stock has sunk since he joined United four years ago. And he still will not accept a pay cut.",
      "Ruben Amorim has not met Sancho and he does not need to. Sancho eschewed pre-season training in his first summer at United in 2021 when he was expected up at St Andrew's, so he can stay away from his current teammates.",
      "Amorim could do without the sight of the content-creating \"brothers\" who undermined United on Sunday, too. Rashford and Garnacho are burning their bridges with United, burnt from remunerating Rashford with a five-year contract two years ago.",

      "It is a bit like that interaction between Danny Rose and Daniel Levy in the Tottenham Hotspur All or Nothing documentary. Rose was available for a loan move and there was interest from Newcastle United and Bournemouth. Rose wanted something more glamorous.",
      "\"Did you follow up on Milan?\" he asks. Levy just about suppresses a cackle. \"Milan's a no at the moment.\" Barcelona could be a no for Rashford.",
      "It is fanciful for United to be rid of Rashford, Sancho and Garnacho by the time of take-off at Manchester Airport on July 22. None should be on the plane, though.",
      "There is no resale value to protect with Sancho and Rashford was exiled six months ago. Garnacho, 21 next week, is different but his relationship with Amorim is strained and the manager visibly chuckled at the remote possibility of Garnacho somehow staying at United next season.",
      "Amorim is not the kind of personality to countenance such an arrangement. It was different with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, saddled with the wantaway Romelu Lukaku in 2019 as United toured Australia, Singapore and China.",
      "Solskjaer repeatedly claimed Lukaku was injured. We had to take him at face value but did not really believe him. Lukaku treated his final trip with United so frivolously he recorded Luke Shaw lagging behind one of the fitness coaches during a jog around the WACA in Perth.",
      "After United returned to Manchester, there were two more friendlies in Norway and Cardiff that Lukaku was absent for. Then he went AWOL.",
      "He finally joined Inter Milan - United's opponents in Singapore - at the end of the Premier League transfer window, back when it closed before the start of the new season.",
      "Lukaku had become such an upstart he leaked data from United's running drills onto Twitter. United, adamant they would not sell for less than the £75m they paid for Lukaku two years earlier, compromised and cut their losses.",
      "Matheus Cunha will be on the plane to the Windy City and United hope Bryan Mbeumo will be. They may have to wait a little longer for that elusive striker, which raises the question as to who would lead the line in a pre-season summer devoid of an international tournament.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has won over many but Amorim does not consider him a specialist striker. High-ranking figures at United speak dismissively of Rasmus Hojlund, generating interest from Inter Milan. Chido Obi is primed to remain in the first team squad but is far too raw.",
      "In my interview with Matthijs de Ligt last month, he expressed approval of Amorim's methods. \"I think what I'm experiencing now is what I like to see and that is what the manager is doing right now. I'm not speaking into details, but I have a feeling he's really looking at the spots.",
      "\"I'm not only speaking about players only, but also about the whole culture and the way we are working at the club. I think he's really into details.\"",
      "We had the ill-fated 'cultural reset' in that summer of 2019. David de Gea told me that \"the culture had to change\". A check of the calendar confirms that De Gea said that in 2022.",

      "In addition to scoring 15 goals and getting six assists in the league last season, he scored 12 goals and registered seven assists in the 2023/24 Premier League campaign. He has proven he can deliver the goods consistently.",
      "The same can be said of Mbeumo. The former Troyes man scored 20 goals in the Premier League last term, only being outscored by Liverpool star Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak of Newcastle United (23) and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (22).",
      "Mbeumo, who is a versatile operator, capable of playing out wide or through the middle, is expected to occupy the right-sided No.10 role in Amorim's system, It means United, should they also add the striker they are in such desperate need of, will have an exciting attack next season.",
      "United's attack was one of the bluntest in the league last term. Adding Mbeumo and a striker to the addition of Cunha could transform it into one of the division's strongest.",
      "United have not had a player score 20 league goals or more in a season since Robin van Persie plundered 26 in the 2012/13 season.",
      "United last had two players score 15 league goals or more in a single season back in the Covid-hit 2019/20 campaign when Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial helped themselves to 17 goals each. If Cunha and Mbeumo were to get 17 goals each next season, they would instantly rank among United's best signings in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Just getting into double figures would count as a success.",
      "No transfer is guaranteed to work out, but United are certainly targeting players of the right profile to fix their biggest problem."

      "The Reds enjoyed a great start to the summer transfer window by wrapping up a deal for Matheus Cunha, but there is still a lot of work to be done before the new season gets underway. United are working hard behind the scenes, with the priority now said to be a new striker.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has emerged as a key target, with the Brentford star reportedly weighing up offers from Old Trafford and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Meanwhile, Andrea Onana faces an uncertain future at United.",
      "Emiliano Martinez has been mooted as a possible replacement for the 29-year-old shot-stopper, who's attracted interest from Monaco. Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho could also be on the move this summer as part of a comprehensive rebuild.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, could help United get their hands on a couple of new faces. Sancho has reportedly turned heads in the Serie A, so a swap deal could be on the cards.",
      "Porto's exit from the Club World Cup has been compounded with reports in Portugal in the aftermath suggesting that Diogo Costa 'believes it is time to embrace a new challenge' after achieving all he can with the club.",
      "A Bola have claimed the goalkeeper wants to move to a bigger league with United and Manchester City two teams described as being 'very interested'.",
      "Costa is understood to have a €75million (£63.9m) release clause but Porto could accept around €60m (£51.1m), a fee which is similar to the one United have paid for Matheus Cunha and are about to pay for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Ever since he broke into the first team, Alejandro Garnacho has never been far away from the headlines.",
      "His talent is undeniable, but he's crossed United managers far too many times and that is a big reason why Ruben Amorim is prepared to offload the Argentina international this summer.",
      "Sunday evening proved to be another one of those occasions as he posted on Instagram wearing an Aston Villa jersey donning the name of fellow United exile Marcus Rashford on the back of it.",
      "It was a deliberate ploy to garner a reaction from fans online and, if anything, has proven why Amorim is right to want to get rid of the 20-year-old this summer.",
      "His talented, though, is undoubted and there will be plenty of suitors for him and United should be able to bank a healthy fee by selling him.",
      "With that in mind, here is a look at the current state of play.",
      "Few players have divided opinion at United in recent years as much as Scott McTominay did. But after he had plundered a respectable tally of ten goals during the 2023/24 campaign, United were left with an important decision to make.",
      "He had just one year remaining on his contract campaign and it meant United had to decide whether to cash-in or attempt to tie him down to a new deal.",
      "After scoring 13 goals and helping Napoli win a second Serie A title in three seasons in his debut season in Italy, United's decision to sell the Scotsman has naturally been called into question.",
      "Taking his contract situation, the landscape of United's midfield options and the financial package on offer, United were right to sell McTominay when they did...",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano and Portuguese outlet A Bola, Viktor Gyokeres has told the Sporting president that he wants to leave this summer. The 27-year-old striker has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League for a while now following his impressive performances in the Portuguese top-flight.",
      "The report claims Gyokeres has no intention of playing for the club anymore as he wants to start a new chapter. Romano reckons that the Sweden international 'feels heartbroken', and he's not expected to return to training.",
      "According to Saudi outlet Sport Jazirah, Al-Nassr are close to signing Casemiro. The report claims that negotiations are at an 'advanced stage' as the 33-year-old closes in on a move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "United forked out £70m to sign Casemiro from Real Madrid in August 2022. The Reds reportedly require need to recuperate £15m to avoid registering a loss, according to the Profit and Sustainability Rules.",
      "According to Caughtoffside, United have shortlisted Marco Carnesecchi as a potential replacement for Andre Onana. The report claims that Atalanta don't want to sell their 24-year-old goalkeeper, although an offer close to €50m (£42m) could make the Serie A outfit change their mind.",
      "It's said that United and Atalanta have an excellent relationship following previous dealings for Amad Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund. Caughtoffside adds that the Reds are also keen on Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa.",
      "Enzo Maresca hinted that Christopher Nkunku could stay at Chelsea this summer despite facing an uncertain future at Stamford Bridge. The former RB Leipzig forward has recently been linked with a move to United as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his frontline.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of the Blues' final Club World Cup group stage game against ES Tunis, Maresca declared: \"Christo is with us. He's our player.",
      "\"He's doing very well in the last four, five days. For sure, tomorrow we are going to do rotation. We'll see if there is any chance for the ones that are not playing a lot.\"",
      "According to Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport, Juventus are willing to offer players to United in a bid to finalise a deal for Jadon Sancho. The report claims that the 25-year-old winger's agents have never broken contact with the Italian giants, who tried to sign him on loan in January 2024.",
      "It's said that United want to offload Sancho, so they're open-minded to proposals in talks; meanwhile, Juventus plan to offer a 'prominent role' in the squad. Gazzetta dello Sport have named Dusan Vlahovic as a potential makeweight.",
      "The 25-year-old striker, who sees his contract in Turin expire next year, has previously been linked with a move to the Premir League. Vlahovic has reportedly been 'unreceptive' to offers to leave the club, snubbing offers from Saudi Arabia and Turkey.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport reckon that Douglas Luiz could be an option too...",
      "According to French outlet L’Equipe, United have made contact with Christopher Nkunku's entourage ahead of a potential transfer to Old Trafford. The report claims the two parties discussed terms of a possible deal, but no offer was made.",
      "It's said that Ruben Amorim is keen to sign at least two forwards this summer. L’Equipe reckon that Nkunku wants to leave Chelsea, and he's attracted interest from several clubs.",
      "That said, no concrete negotiations have taken place yet, and it remains to be seen whether United will pursue his signature.",
      "It's understood that Mbeumo wants to join United, despite firm interest from Tottenham Hotspur since they poached Thomas Frank from the G-Tech Community Staduium.",
      "Andre Onana has lobbied his international teammate to join, and one of his close relatives is also a supporter, which is believed to have further emboldened the Reds.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side enjoyed a great start to the summer transfer window by wrapping up a deal for Matheus Cunha, but there is still a lot of work to be done before the new season gets underway...",

      "Villa want around £60m for the England international and need to raise funds this summer to ease their PSR concerns.",
      "AS Monaco have made 'concrete contact' with Torino goalkeeper and Man United target Vanja Milinković-Savić.",

      "The updates are coming at us tonight and here's one that could develop into something.",
      "Saudi Arabian outlet Sport Jazirah have claimed that Cristiano Ronaldo's Al-Nassr are close to signing Casemiro from United. The report states that negotiations are thought to be at an advanced stage.",

      "The news that you have all been waiting for.",

      "Fenerbahce have reportedly reached out to Manchester United regarding the conditions to sign Jadon Sancho.",
      "Turkish journalist Yagiz Sabuncuoglu has claimed that Jose Mourinho's men have formally enquired about Sancho's availability. It's also said that Mourinho is the driving force behind the deal.",
      "Man United have identified FC Krasnodar's Eduard Spertsyan as a possible signing this summer, according to Tutto Atalanta.",

      "It's reported that Krasnodar value him at €25m.",
      "Marcus Rashford is one of the attacking players that Newcastle are targeting this summer.",
      "Eddie Howe is said to be keen on adding another forward to his arsenal this summer and are running the risk of missing out on Joao Pedro.",
      "Football Insider have reported how a possible loan move for Rashford could be on the cards.",
      "News of United's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo has taken another twist with news of Brentford's demand on the formalities of the deal.",
      "After being unsuccessful with a £55m bid including add-ons, United are expected to make another offer. However, the Evening Standard have reported that the Bees want the majority of the fee paid upfront rather than it being a payment plan over several years.",
      "A name that continues to be mentioned in United's hunt for a new attacker is Christopher Nkunku.",
      "L'Equipe journalist Loic Tanzi has reported that United have opened initial talks with Chelsea to sign Nkunku, who is under contract until 2029. It's said they contacted the entourage in recent days to discuss a possivle transfer.",
      "Unfortunately, it's not the news you were hoping for regarding Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "According to the Manchester World, Diego Leon will become United's next arrival from Cerro Porteno. The deal is reportedly set to be confirmed in July after reaching an agreement with the left-back in January.",
      "The £7m deal will see Leon assessed in the summer before a decision is made on his short-term future.",
      "Hello and good afternoon Manchester United fans!",
      "My name is Josh Holland and I will be guiding you through this Monday afternoon and evening. The latest transfer news, gossip and opinion will all be coming your way so stay tuned!",
      "Man United have been handed an inadvertent boost in their mooted pursuit for Emi Martinez.",
      "Speculation around the Aston Villa goalkeeper and his future remains at fever pitch this summer. Several reports have underlined Martinez, 32, as a potential replacement for Andre Onana.",
      "Earmarked as a potential target for United this summer, he's also thought to have admirers in Saudi Arabia with a lucrative move to the Gulf state on the cards. A transfer fee around £30-40 million has been suggested. Martinez himself is said to be \"open\" to a move to Old Trafford. And now United have seemingly been advised on why they might have the advantage in any transfer battle.",
      "Sean Dyche admitted he tried to sign Gyokeres before the striker joined Sporting CP in 2023.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"That boy, Gyokeres... I have to be honest and admit that he is a great player. I saw him play in the Championship for Coventry and then we managed to play a pre-season game with Sporting and I immediately thought to myself that he was a very strong striker.",
      "\"I say this and it's not because of the goals he scores, because his game is much more than that. I tried to sign him before he joined Sporting but his value only went up.\"",
      "And then there were four. Through just a couple of taps of his smart phone, Alejandro Garnacho has joined Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony on Manchester United's list of priority sales.",
      "Garnacho, through his talent and undoubted potential, still had a case for staying in the eyes of some. However, whereas United were previously prepared to offload him for the right price, they now need to ensure they get him off the books this summer alongside Rashford, Sancho and Antony come what may.",
      "Amorim is attempting to oversee the birth of a new dawn at Old Trafford and he cannot waste time dealing with the fallout and noise generated from social media posts that purposely attempt to stir the pot.",
      "They are unnecessary and avoidable. Garnacho has just become the fourth member of a three-man wantaway list.",
      "Chelsea striker Liam Delap has said the Londoners' project was what convinced him to seal a £30million move to Stamford Bridge earlier this month.",
      "Delap became available via a £30m release clause that was triggered following Ipswich's immediate relegation back to the Championship. He joined the Tractor Boys from Manchester City as last July.",
      "\"It was a nice position to be in, but also there are a lot of decisions you have to make,\" said Delap. \"You never know if it is going to be the right decision. You've just got to go with your gut and hopefully it works out. There are so many factors that go into it.",
      "\"I’ve got a good relationship with the manager. I know how he plays. I've played in this system before. I know a lot of the players here and the project of the club, how they see the future. That's what excited me.\"",
      "According to sources, Garnacho has told friends at Man United that Argentina would prefer him to move to a more competitive league ahead of next year’s World Cup in the USA, Canada, and Mexico - reports The Mirror.",
      "While the wages in Saudi Arabia are tempting, the 20-year-old is reluctant to risk his chances of making the World Cup squad.",
      "Argentina are said to favour a move to another Premier League club, or potentially to Spain or Italy.",
      "Man United are expected to be busy in the summer transfer market - both in terms of incomings and outgoings.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side now know they will kick off their Premier League campaign at home to Arsenal but the squad as it is now will look very different come August 17.",
      "United will hope to blood some new signings against the Gunners but there will be a number of departures this summer, too.",
      "United are expected to make at least one change to the goalkeeping department but the question is whether it is their first or second choice goalkeeper who leaves this summer.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Juventus are reportedly willing to offer Dusan Vlahovic to Man United as part of a potential swap deal for Jadon Sancho.",
      "However, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Juventus remain in the race and have ‘not let go’ of Sancho since first expressing interest in the England international over a year ago.",
      "It’s claimed that the 'direct link has never been broken' between Sancho’s camp and Juventus, with the attacker reportedly willing to accept a pay cut to facilitate a move to Turin, where he would have a chance to revive his faltering career.",
      "Sancho is said to view the Juventus shirt as 'prestigious' and discussions between Juventus and United continue through multiple intermediaries. The report indicates that both clubs might even explore a swap deal involving Sancho and Vlahovic.",
      "However, Vlahovic has been reluctant to leave Juventus so far, amid interest from clubs in Turkey and the Saudi Pro League."

      "You would be hard-pressed to find a striker who has not been linked with Manchester United in this summer's transfer window already.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, United have been left with no choice but to explore alternative avenues in their search for a goalscorer.",
      "Delap was available for £30million this summer via a release clause, meaning he would have been a relatively straightforward signing to have got over the line.",
      "However, despite scoring a respectable tally of 12 Premier League goals for relegated Ipswich Town last season, United are in need of someone more proven and experienced. It is why ongoing reports linking them with Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli ace Victor Osimhen make so much sense.",
      "The aforementioned duo have established themselves as two of Europe's most prolific and reliable goal-getters in the last couple of years. Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in the last two seasons for Sporting and Osimhen plundered 37 goals in 41 games on loan at Galatasaray in 2024/25.",
      "As a result, both of them will command hefty-sized transfer fees this summer. It is no secret United need to watch the pennies this summer, meaning outgoings will dictate what can be achieved amid their hunt for a striker.",
      "The Reds have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo looks set to command a similar fee. If they spend somewhere in the region of £120m just on those two, incomings are likely to cease until players are sold.",
      "It is why United, as desperate as they are for a No.9, may have to lower their expectations when trying to source a goal-getter and move away from those with such prestigious profiles.",
      "Among the strikers to have been linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent months is Crystal Palace ace Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Frenchman, who will turn 28 later this week, enjoyed an excellent 2024/25 campaign at Selhurst Park, scoring 17 goals across all competitions.",
      "Mateta has made impressive progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz in January 2021, initially on loan, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he did need time to adjust and it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to fulfil his potential.",
      "He scored 19 times that season, meaning he has scored 36 goals over the last two campaigns for Palace. He has also chipped in with ten assists during that time.",
      "Although he did not score during Palace's run to lifting the FA Cup at Wembley in May, he did play a key role. He was particularly key to their winning goal against Manchester City in the final.",
      "Using his physicality and strength to hold off Josko Gvardiol, Mateta played a cushioned pass to Daichi Kamada, got the return, took a few strides forward, slipped in Daniel Munoz, who had made an enterprising run down the right, and he sent in a low cross that was turned in by Eberechi Eze.",
      "Eze will always be remembered for scoring the goal that earned Palace their first major trophy, but Mateta played a key role in making it possible, showcasing what his profile is all about.",
      "First and foremost, Mateta is a goalscorer, but his all-round game is about much more, making him an attractive option. He would tick a lot of boxes for United.",
      "\"He's a boring striker to play against,\" Thierry Henry said of Mateta last year. \"He doesn't lose the ball much, and he goes at the last defender.",
      "\"He uses his physicality, he's good with his head, and he scores. It's important that a striker like that gives you another dimension.\"",
      "Although he would tie in with United's objective of signing proven Premier League players this summer, he is unlikely to be available at a price they could currently entertain. His contract was due to expire next summer, but Palace triggered the option they had to extend his stay until 2027 last December, meaning they have protected his value.",
      "Had his deal been up next summer, United may have been able to convince Palace into considering a sale at a cut-price fee amid the danger of him leaving for free next year.",
      "Instead, with two years remaining on his deal, Palace, in the event of suitors coming knocking, have plenty of leeway to try and demand as a high a price as possible for one of their star attractions. Their valuation is unlikely to be affordable for United right now."

      "You may have come across the late-night football programme El Chiringuito in Spain, a telenovela punditry programme where bad news is treated as a tragedy, almost cause for national mourning.",
      "It is so partisan that Florentino Perez, the Real Madrid president, used it as his platform to plug the Super League. Perez described Madrid as \"broke\" and went unchallenged. Months later, they bought Aurelien Tchouameni for €80million.",
      "The programme is live and much of it is undoubtedly scripted but it is not a parody. When Kylian Mbappe had the temerity to reject Madrid in 2022, José Félix Díaz, of Marca, turned to the camera and addressed Mbappe directly: \"You'll be a great player, but never a great man.\" Tomas Roncero vented that Mbappe must \"swallow the Eiffel Tower\" to ever play for Madrid.",
      "English football coverage is better off without its own El Chiringuito. You wonder how Marcus Rashford, who floated the possibility of playing at Barcelona in a chat with a Spanish influencer, would cope with the show's Catalan contingent if his body language regresses.",
      "Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have become content-creation collaborators in the Manchester United departures' lounge. United still pay their wages but they brazenly undermined their employers with a choreographed stunt on Sunday.",
      "Rashford was injured for that humbling at Wembley but was present at the boxing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium later that evening. We are long past the point where Rashford cared about the optics of his social life. He attended a birthday party on Deansgate hours after he was cheered off in a 3-0 Manchester derby defeat at Old Trafford.",
      "Any notion that Garnacho's post was not choreographed beggars belief. You can tell when he is uploading onto his Instagram page (his passive-aggressive pre-Europa League final story and return from the post-season tour).",
      "The other giveaway is Rashford's use of the word \"brother\" in the comments. It is the most hollow and meaningless noun in football. Rashford and Garnacho have only ever socialised during team-bonding dinners.",
      "Garnacho and Rashford rarely linked up on the pitch, never mind off it. Garnacho pinched Rashford's place on the left wing. One of Rashford's inner circle dubbed him a \"f*****g Ronaldo wannabe\". Now they are \"brothers\".",
      "In all probability, neither player literally posted or commented. Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, accidentally sent a tweet intended for Rashford's Twitter account from the DN May Sports agency he runs in September 2021. Having interviewed Rashford, a thoughtful talker, his often banal captions never sound like something he would ever say.",
      "Maynard was summoned to United's Carrington training complex after Rashford's Belfast bender in January 2024. They know their race is run at United but it is still unedifying to see a player who joined the club's academy 20 years ago publicly stoop to such a petty low.",
      "Garnacho's own advisers, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, have succeeded and failed with the Argentine. They have a client whose value was listed in excess of £100m last year but literally leave Garnacho to his own (smartphone) devices.",
      "He is a loose cannon, regularly sounding off on social media, and failing to gag his lippy brother. Cambeiro and De Lucas are part of the problem. They let the world know they were at Stamford Bridge in January, when Chelsea were giving serious consideration to bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho turns 21 next week yet acts like the finished article. He is finished at United and, in his desperation, has found an ally in Rashford.",
      "Rashford and Garnacho were both lucratively remunerated in 2023. Garnacho kicked on. It kicked off with Rashford. They had little in common other than their position until they irked Amorim in Plzen back in December.",
      "They were close on the morning of December 15, when both were training at Carrington having been dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby. Garnacho, to his credit, went in one direction and played in every remaining match last season bar the final day win over Villa. Rashford decided on a change of scenery.",
      "It is particularly sobering for United that the two upstarts are academy products that represent the best of both worlds. The local lad and the gem unearthed from abroad.",
      "Some in the United academy can be quick to pat themselves on the back when there is a history of some of their most talented products posing problems, from the frivolous to the serious. The academy cannot parent a player throughout their career or be held completely accountable, but it is cause to take stock.",
      "The brazenness of Garnacho's post and Rashford's comment is a throwback to Paul Pogba - another academy graduate - revelling in Jose Mourinho's sacking on Twitter with his 'Caption this' post. Pogba was never disciplined over that.",
      "United resisted selling Pogba, tolerated the late Mino Raiola declaring \"it's over\" for him on the eve of a decisive Champions League tie at RB Leipzig (that United lost) and released him. The Stretford End repeatedly chanted \"F**k off, Pogba\" after he was substituted against Norwich City in April 2022. He did. Pogba never played at Old Trafford again.",

      "Should Mbeumo join, he would be the second summer signing alongside Matheus Cunha, after he signed from Wolves.",
      "And if a deal is completed, United's business won't be stopping there, with the club looking to sign another forward in the form of a starting striker.",
      "Pre-season is on the horizon for Amorim as he hopes to inspire seismic change in order to rectify their horror show in the Premier League last term.",
      "They finished just above the relegation zone, marking their worst top-flight performance in over 50 years, before losing in the Europa League final against Spurs.",
      "United are set to return on July 7 before travelling Stateside, arriving in Chicago to begin their three-match tour."

      "Manchester United have streamlined their scouting system to ten first-team scouts.",
      "Christopher Vivell, the director of recruitment, has been empowered to oversee United's recruitment network since he arrived at the club last year.",
      "Vivell joined United last year, initially on a temporary basis, and helped oversee recruitment in the club's first summer since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became a minority shareholder in February 2024.",
      "United's scouting network was once so bloated it was in excess of 100 scouts but dozens have left the club across the two rounds of redundancies over the past 12 months.",
      "Armand Benneker, Marco de Sisti, Roy Beukenkamp, Giuseppe Antonaccio, Ben McFarlan (technical), Jose Mayorga, John Lambert, Norbert Düwel, Steve Head and Nicolas Cinalli are all still listed as United-employed first team scouts.",
      "United sources say they want Vivell to take ownership of the reduced scouting network after years of poor business in the transfer market.",
      "The strategy follows the trend of several clubs scaling back their in-person scouting network in favour of recruitment analysts. Brighton, widely acclaimed for their recruitment strategy, let go of the majority of their scouts last year due to their dependence on a bespoke data model that owner Tony Bloom relies on.",
      "Ratcliffe last season lamented that United are \"still in the last century on data analysis\". Former football director John Murtough championed a data-led approach to recruitment and hired Dominic Jordan as the head of data science. Both left within five months of the confirmation of Ratcliffe's stakeholding.",
      "Vivell, 38, previously worked at RB Leipzig and Chelsea, where he was the technical director for only six months."

      "Signing a new forward is imperative for Amorim's plan but they don't tend to come cheap. Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike, all of whom have been linked with United, would command hefty fees.",

      "Manchester United are heading into July, a month which could make-or-break their next 10 months, with a good deal of business still to complete.",
      "Ruben Amorim has already managed to add Matheus Cunha to his 2025/2026 squad planner and the Portuguese will be hoping to welcome Bryan Mbeumo to Carrington when pre-season starts in July.",
      "However, a move for the Brentford star has stalled, in recent weeks, and their pursuit of a centre-forward has also failed to gather pace. After recording their worst season in 51 years, United are on a mission to return to their peak.",
      "July means a new financial accounting period - and that usually comes with a flurry of transfer business. Two more attacking reinforcements are anticipated before the window shuts, ideally before Amorim and his players jet off to the United States, as well.",
      "They are relatively limited in what they can do in the market until they generate funds from player sales. Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho appear to be the two closest to securing exits, with Marcus Rashford and Antony also tipped to leave.",
      "Cunha is one part of three on United's attacking to-do list. Mbeumo would make it two out of three, but the final hurdle is a frontman. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshus Zirkzee failed to deliver, and the number of forwards linked with moves to Old Trafford point towards a marquee signing.",
      "Whether it's Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen or Ollie Watkins who arrive, United will have a new No.9 on their books for the start of the new season. Wildcard options, like Moise Keane and Tolu Arokodare, offer interesting cases.",
      "However, the transfer fees required for Osimhen and Gyokeres are currently too high. That's why Dusan Vlahovic is a striker United should be all over. Not only does the Juventus player come with top-flight experience and a decent track record in front of goal - 106 in 252 games in Italy - but he has a point to prove.",
      "After bursting on to the scene with Fiorentina and then rejecting Arsenal, Vlahovic has always appeared to have doubts over his quality. Interest seems to be floated about every window but a move never occurs. But with one year left on his deal in Turin, now could be the perfect time.",
      "Reports in Italy have suggested that Juventus could look to offer Vlahovic and Douglas Luiz to United in order to sign Sancho. If United aren't going to break the bank for Gyokeres or Osimhen, then Vlahovic should be a number one candidate.",
      "Depending on your personal view on certain individuals in Amorim's squad, this figure could - or should - be more than five. Selling players is a priority that United don't want to have but are forced to.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are all expected to be sold. Right now, there doesn't appear to be any concrete move on the cards, but there is interest. Bringing in a hefty transfer fee for Garnacho and Antony would significantly help United improve their squad, but Sancho and Rashford's monstrous wages are proving to be a problem to get them off the books permanently.",
      "The fifth name on this list is Hojlund. For large parts of this transfer window, I've backed Hojlund to stay at United and fight for his place with the anticipated newcomer. But, now, with Inter Milan and other Italian teams showing interest, the right deal would be enough to warrant a sale.",
      "If all five players did leave, I'm not sure there would be much dismay in Old Trafford. Should United get the transfer fees they have demanded for every player, they would welcome just shy of £200million.",
      "Amorim knows his current squad rather well now after last season but there have been some decisions that have provided more questions than answers; Andre Onana being dropped, only to come back in, starting Mason Mount in the Europa League final and misusing Bruno Fernandes all falling under that bracket.",
      "For me, Kobbie Mainoo's treatment has been the main head-scratcher. The midfielder was starting for England in the European Championship 12 months ago - and was destined for a huge first season as a first-team regular. That wasn't the case, though.",
      "He started 23 of his 37 appearances last season but spent the latter stages of the campaign off the bench. Coming on in the 90th minute in Bilbao against Tottenham was poor decision-making when you consider there's not many in the United team who offer the energy, passing range or passion that the academy graduate offers.",
      "There are still question marks over Manuel Ugarte and with Fernandes expected to own one of the two midfielder roles, Mainoo has all the tools to be the trusted ally for Amorim to settle things down in the middle of the park.",
      "Now for the wildcard signing, or signings, in defence. First of all, they should get Diogo Costa through the door to replace Onana. If United are going to return to their best, they have to eliminate the mistakes that Onana has been making between the posts.",
      "In defence, United are strong at centre-back and - with no European competition to contend with - there's little need for a replacement for Victor Lindelof. However, Lisandro Martinez's injury and fear over whether Ayden Heaven or Leny Yoro are necessarily 'ready' to carry the weight that comes with playing for United mean investing in Castello Lukeba, Dani Vivian or Antonio Silva would add security at the back."

      "Ugarte is a favourite of Ruben Amorim having worked with him at Sporting CP but hasn't quite lived up to the expectation that surrounded him when he arrived from PSG last summer.",
      "Mainoo was United's breakout star in 2023/24 and ended the season by starting for England in the final of EURO 2024. Last season proved more difficult, though, with injuries hampering his progress and Amorim seemingly not sure of his starting position.",
      "United will look to find a player to drive Ugarte and Mainoo on next season and compete to start alongside Fernandes. But if moves for Mbeumo and a forward prove to be expensive, United may look for a more cost effective option in midfield.",
      "And that search could bring them to Feyenoord captain Quinten Timber, twin brother of Arsenal defender Jurrien, who is out of contract at De Kuip at the end of next season.",
      "Transfermarkt value the Dutch international at around £30million and he is a player who Liverpool manager Arne Slot loves. Slot managed the 24-year-old at De Kuip and he described Timber as a 'special player'.",
      "When asked about links with Timber joining Arsenal, Slot told ZiggoSport: \"If he continues to develop as he has this year, then his ceiling is extremely high because he has undergone great development over the past year.",
      "\"He is a special player. He has the strength and speed to create an overload in midfield. I think he has a very good mentality and is a good lad. [Quinten and Jurrien] are both very, very good. I don't think it is ruled out that Quinten could also go to a club of [Arsenal's] calibre.\"",
      "Former Tottenham and Real Madrid midfielder Rafael van der Vaart has described him as 'incredibly good' while Dutch national team coach Ronald Koeman has spoken about how he feels Timber is ready to take the next step abroad.",
      "Given his situation, and the testimonies of Slot, Van Der Vaart and Koeman, United could do a lot worse than shopping in the Eredivisie again."

Initially featuring for the academy, Garnacho broke into the senior squad during United's 3-0 win over Moldovan team Sheriff Tiraspol in the 2022 UEFA Europa League, starting alongside Cristiano Ronaldo.",

      "Keane believes Garnacho cannot be trusted to start for United, suggesting he performs better as a substitute off the bench.",
      "Speaking to ITV during United's FA Cup tie against Leicester City in February, he said: \"I think it suits Garnacho when he comes off the bench. I don’t think you can trust him when he starts. But when he comes off the bench and you’re gambling and the team is stretched, that’s when he comes into his own.",
      "\"United put Leicester on the backfoot and the subs came on. That’s what Garnacho does well. The first half United were going sideways and sideways. He came on and tested Leicester.\"",
      "Before United’s Manchester derby against Manchester City, Keane shared his thoughts on what the Argentine winger needed to improve in his game.",
      "\"That's an area of his game that, if he wants to stay at this Man United team and get Man United competing towards the top, end product is key. If we go back to even Foden, when they're all fit it's the end product, the final pass or actually getting a goal.",
      "\"So Garnacho, huge questions, I was a big fan of him last year and thought he was going to kick on but this season, but he's not as of yet.\"",
      "After scoring in United’s 3-0 win over Leicester City last November, Keane criticized the Argentine’s muted celebration. The former midfielder argued that players should show respect to fans who travel to watch them play, adding that he should leave the club if he can’t even celebrate with them.",
      "\"If you can’t celebrate a goal, there is something drastically wrong with this game,\" the former Reds captain Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Whatever has gone on off the pitch for any player - it could be family stuff - you work all week, you’re playing the game to score a goal.",
      "\"When you score a goal, there should be nothing else on your mind. You’ve got fans who have travelled, paid fortunes to get there, and he’s [Garnacho] on about people having a go at him. People make sacrifices to travel to watch Manchester United, he scores a brilliant goal, they are having a tough time - and if a younger player can’t enjoy scoring a goal for Man United, then get a job somewhere else.\"",
      "Keane singled out Garnacho for criticism following the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea last month. \"Garnacho is immature,\" he stated.",
      "\"He plays in little moments, but he doesn't do enough. We spoke before the programme - you want players for the big clubs that turn up week in, week out. He doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent; he makes some good runs and threatens in behind. On his good day, you think, 'I like what I see.' But he's got too many bad days.\""

      "A potential swap deal involving Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic could be on the horizon.",
      "Sancho, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, where he clinched the UEFA Conference League, is expected to be sold this summer. His last appearance for the Red Devils was in the Community Shield last year, marking a disappointing stint for both player and club.",
      "One possibility being mooted is a move to Juventus in exchange for the Serbian striker. The 25-year-old, previously linked with Arsenal, has been largely confined to the bench at the Italian giants following the loan signing of Randal Kolo-Muani in January.",
      "Italian media reports suggest that Juventus are considering offering Vlahovic - who has a year left on his contract - to secure Sancho, whom they have been interested in since last year, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "Despite boasting a respectable tally of 57 goals in 144 games, Vlahovic has struggled to replicate the lethal form he displayed during his time at Fiorentina, reports the Mirror.",
      "This season, he has scored 16 goals across all competitions, just one less than Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee combined. This scoring prowess will undoubtedly be attractive to the Premier League giants.",
      "Regarding his uncertain future, the Serbian striker reportedly turned down an eye-watering £17million-a-year deal back in January, according to Corriere dello Sport. Despite not yet reaching his peak, Vlahovic's decision to stay in a top European league rather than accepting a lucrative offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr could be seen as a positive sign by United bosses.",
      "It shows that he has ambitions to compete for trophies on the top stage rather than take a big payday.",
      "Vlahovic's commitment to his club and team-mates, meanwhile, was evident last season during a challenging period for Juventus. After a fourth consecutive Serie A draw, which ended 2-2 against Venezia, the Juve players walked over to their fans to thank them for their support, as is tradition.",
      "However, the fans responded with insults and disrespectful chants. Vlahovic didn't take kindly to this and shouted back at the fans. Despite the players walking away, the fans continued with their insults, prompting the striker to give them a sarcastic thumbs-up, as reported by Sky Sport Italia.",
      "While it's not ideal for a player to have a row with their own supporters, it does demonstrate to United that Vlahovic isn't shy about expressing his views and will back his team-mates when he deems it necessary.",
      "Introducing such a robust character into the dressing room could yield both positive and negative outcomes, and Ruben Amorim will undoubtedly be weighing up a variety of factors as he continues his quest for additional reinforcements this summer, including a new striker.",
      "The Portuguese boss has so far welcomed one new signing this summer in Matheus Cunha, who they purchased for £62.5m from Wolves. While interest persists in Bryan Mbeumo and Viktor Gyokeres, United are facing competition for the attackers from Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, respectively."

      "United are desperate to recruit a striker this summer and Delap held talks with them about a move to Old Trafford. However, the former Hull City loanee, who also held talks with Everton and Newcastle United, settled on a move to Chelsea.",
      "\"It was a nice position to be in, but also there are a lot of decisions you have to make,\" Delap told the Athletic. \"You never know if it is going to be the right decision.",

      "\"I’ve got a good relationship with the manager. I know how he plays. I've played in this system before.",
      "\"I know a lot of the players here and the project of the club, how they see the future. That's what excited me.\"",
      "As a result of missing out on Delap, United are yet to identify their preferred alternative target in their search for a No.9.

But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle.

United need a centre-forward and want rid of Rashford, who often started ahead of Watkins for Villa in the second half of last season. Speculative for the moment, but it could become an option later in the summer.",

Getting rid of Garnacho would be the big win, but Nkunku is not the type of forward they really need. If they sign Bryan Mbeumo to play as a no.10 alongside Matheus Cunha, then they are sorted for forwards off the front man – it’s the central striker they badly need.

      "9) 🔽 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. But they are making slow progress, if any. Palace offered £35million; Sporting want closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Talks are talking place, Trafford wants the move… expect this to happen once the new PSR year starts next week, probably for around £30million. Prompting some good old-fashion keeper dominoes.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nSpurs are reported to have piqued Mbeumo’s interest and the prospect of staying in London to play for a manager he trusts would certainly appeal. But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nApparently, Arsenal are hot again for Gyokeres having failed to agree a deal for Benjamin Sesko. So they’re back trying to negotiate with Sporting, who blew them out last time. Assuming they are serious and don’t switch targets for the 427th time, Arsenal want Gyokeres through the door before their pre-season tour to Asia. We just want Arsenal to pick a lane for this to be over.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We wait to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m.",
      "",
      "2) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIn Merseyside for a medical. Assuming the left-back gets the all-clear from Liverpool’s doc, he’ll be unveiled shortly.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million."

      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top 10.",
      "These are the greatest decreases in market value since January 1 of players contracted to Premier League clubs, with figures taken from Transfermarkt.",
      "",
      "10) Joel Ndala (Manchester City)\nIt could still be that Ndala is soon entered into the Manchester City cheat code as the 19-year-old is yet to make his debut for the club he joined aged 10.",
      "But if this past season was designed to mark his professional breakthrough after forming part of the travelling Etihad squad for the 2023 Club World Cup and winning the 2024 FA Youth Cup final, the plan went awry somewhere along the line.",
      "A loan to PSV with an £8.4m option to buy went so well that Manchester City cancelled it in February to send Ndala to Nottingham Forest with the same clause, only this time worth £4m.",
      "That rather neatly captures the fall in value suffered by the forward, who will be stuck this summer until Manchester City get around to sorting new temporary homes for those players who have fallen through the cracks between the Academy and the first team.",
      "",
      "9) Deivid Washington (Chelsea)\n“Leaving was God’s plan. I wanted to stay at Santos, but I spoke to my parents and had the chance to go to Chelsea. We chose together. God spoke to me and we went to Chelsea,” said Washington in a risible endorsement of the divine one’s work as an agent earlier this year.",
      "The Brazilian forward is right to put his own personal slant and transparently brave face on things but if “God’s plan” as a footballer ever involves being signed for £14m, making three substitute appearances of a combined 25 minutes and being sent back to your former club within 18 months with five years remaining on your contract with the team which has clearly forgotten about your existence and bought a handful more younger players in your position, then God has messed up.",
      "“It was not a mistake,” Washington continued to insist as he slowly shrank and transformed into a corn cob, having scored one goal in 14 games back at Santos. “I left when I had to leave and came back when I had to come back,” he added, summing up the life of a Chelsea player destined to be loaned out about seven more times before his deal expires.",
      "",
      "8) Adrian Mazilu (Brighton)\nBrighton are far from above speculating to accumulate. The key difference which separates them from most in the transfer market is how phenomenal they are at it.",
      "But there are no cast-iron guarantees in player identification and recruitment; Brighton’s impressive hit-rate only means the chances of them developing the next Moises Caicedo or Alexis Mac Allister rather than Valentin Barco or Abdallah Sima’s successor is akin to a coin flip.",
      "Mazilu has fallen by that wayside hard. An exciting January 2024 signing made in advance, the Romanian forward was sent on an immediate loan to Vitesse as Brighton turned the tables and copied Chelsea’s homework.",
      "With opportunities difficult to come by in the Eredivisie, it was instead decided that Mazilu would spend this past season under the watchful eye of the Seagulls, who perhaps did not expect for him to suffer a foreboding hamstring injury and myriad recovery setbacks which have sidelined him until this summer.",
      "When Mazilu is introduced back into the fold, it won’t be as part of the first team. But it will be with three years left on his contract.",
      "",
      "7) Kendry Paez (Chelsea)\nNothing sums BlueCo Chelsea up quite like two of Mauricio Pochettino’s first ‘signings’ as manager: a player bought during the reign of his predecessor; and a player whose pre-arranged purchase means he will make his debut for the club under the Argentinean’s successor.",
      "Paez might consider his £17.27m move from Independiente del Valle to be a triumph if he makes it as far as actually playing for Enzo Maresca, who confirmed that the teenager had belatedly joined them on Club World Cup duty in the United States this summer after some confusion.",
      "But with that came a familiar harbinger of bomb squad ruin. “We’ll see what the plan is in the next few weeks,” said the head coach, who will presumably spend that time perfecting his phrasing of ‘You ever heard of Strasbourg, fella?’.",
      "",
      "6) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nEven with some eye-catching performances on loan, that filthy Leicester brush was bound to tar Buonanotte.",
      "Brighton had stockpiled more than enough talent to afford to send some down the Premier League food chain last season. Ipswich borrowed Julio Enciso, West Ham were loaned Evan Ferguson, Buonanotte was posted to Leicester and Southampton were left wondering what they’d done wrong.",
      "Buonanotte impressed in bursts as one of the bigger fish in a small and cursed pond, but also incited the fury of Ruud van Nistelrooy after one particularly wasteful substitute appearance and only featured infrequently thereafter.",
      "",
      "5) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nIt feels like Manchester United would take that £40m if offered again. It doesn’t bear thinking about how many people Sir Jim Ratcliffe would be willing to make redundant for Napoli to pick up the phone and start things where they left off in January.",
      "“You better pray that you can find a club to sign you,” Ruben Amorim told Garnacho in front of his Manchester United teammates at the end of the season, yet a willing buyer was right there in the winter to answer that invocation.",
      "The way Garnacho and his team have systematically decimated his value in a matter of months is almost impressive. A 20-year-old Argentina international forward who trailed just Bruno Fernandes, Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot for outfield minutes at Manchester United last season – and only Fernandes for goals – sounds entirely worthy of that £60m valuation.",
      "But it is preposterous considering his ostracisation under this manager is painfully public knowledge, Garnacho’s reaction to which has involved taking some increasingly childish measures specifically designed to court controversy.",
      "",
      "4) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nThere will be no rival shirts worn with the name of a similarly exiled teammate pointedly emblazoned on the back, no habitual middle finger deployment at the sign of a camera, no agent-based buffoonery.",
      "But the fall of Mainoo from teenage midfield sensation to an injury-prone potential sale with no fixed position needs to be studied and proves how deep the toxicity at Old Trafford runs.",
      "Amorim is yet to establish where he feels Mainoo best fits into his system. The England international has been trialled in more defensive roles and as a centre-forward but it is yet to click for player or manager.",
      "The idea Manchester United could still generate £150m from offloading both Mainoo and Garnacho feels absurd but a decision must be made as to whether they rehabilitate the former themselves or let someone else pay a knockdown fee for the honour.",
      "",
      "3) Ibrahim Osman (Brighton)\n“When you perform at Brighton, you get to play. That’s why I chose Brighton,” said Osman recently, having had neither the chance to perform nor play on the coast.",
      "Brighton announced Osman’s signing from Nordsjaelland in February 2024 and sent him on loan to Feyenoord by that August in the hope it would provide some extra seasoning, including Champions League experience.",
      "The Ghanaian forward received precisely that, even starting and impressing against runners-up Inter in the knockouts.",
      "The expectation from Brighton might have been for Osman to start more than six Eredivisie games before returning but three goals and assists apiece for the country’s third-best team suggested there is a player for Fabian Hurzeler to work with if he so wishes.",
      "",
      "2) Luis Guilherme (West Ham)\nAs a £25.5m signing from Palmeiras, Luis Guilherme might have foreseen an easier path to the West Ham first team.",
      "A Brazilian teenager living and playing outside of his home country for the first time, the winger would have accepted a period of acclimatisation was necessary.",
      "But his 13 appearances for the Hammers last season were spread out across 139 underwhelming minutes under two different managers, neither of whom seemed to know what to do with former Liverpool target Guilherme. It doesn’t feel like Graham Potter will have learned over the course of the summer.",
      "",
      "1) Evan Ferguson (Brighton)\nThe West Ham curse is real, although again it is ultimately Brighton whose model has harmed some players as much as it has helped others.",
      "An ankle ligament injury requiring surgery did the most damage to Ferguson’s stratospheric ascent through the ranks and onto that most inevitable of places for a thriving teenage goalscorer: the transfer shortlists of Chelsea and Manchester United.",
      "But managerial changes and the club’s general shift away from a style of play which more suited Ferguson has seen him crash to maybe fifth in the centre-forward pecking order.",
      "Brighton felt they had a £100m asset and for a time they probably did, but one goal in his last 44 games across all competitions has seen Ferguson’s stock fall as hard as it rose.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho’s latest antics have seen him labelled a ‘little dope’ in need of a ‘clip around the ear’ by one prominent football pundit.",
      "A Manchester United transfer reportedly hinges on one condition, while a Red Devils star has been pictured wearing the shirt of a rival Premier League club.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea are targeting eight players for two positions, including four Premier League stars, to revamp Maresca’s attack as Mudryk faces a four-year ban.",

      "The Blues have been heavily linked with Garnacho over the past six months as he’s been an option for Enzo Maresca’s side since the January transfer window.",
      "In January, Man Utd opened the door to Garnacho leaving as they looked to sanction pure profit sales to balance the books, but they are currently actively looking to offload their academy product.",
      "This follows his major fallout with head coach Ruben Amorim, who has reportedly told Garnacho to ‘find a new club’ after he spat his dummy out following Man Utd’s loss to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho endured a disappointing campaign in 2024/25 as the talented winger was often infuriating to watch as he was consistently wasteful in the final third.",
      "The Argentina international is also unsuited to Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation as he has struggled to adapt to the No.10 role. He slipped in the pecking order during the run-in and only made a 20-minute cameo off the bench in the Europa League final.",
      "READ: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?",
      "Garnacho subsequently hit out at Man Utd’s sh*t season and has recently further alienated himself, posing in a Aston Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford’s name on the back.",
      "Now, a report from The Telegraph confirms Chelsea are still in the running to sign Garnacho, as they and Man Utd are ‘weighing up’ deals for the winger and Christopher Nkunku.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Nkunku and Garnacho both want to quit their respective clubs and the prospect of them trading places has not been ruled out, although there is no expectation of a swap deal being negotiated.",
      "‘Separate transfers involving Nkunku and Garnacho moving in opposite directions would solve headaches for both United and Chelsea, but the clubs are yet to hold direct talks on the matter this summer.’",
      "The Athletic have provided more details on Garnacho’s situation, as he’s decided that a move to London is at the ‘top of his list’ of options.",
      "Chelsea are mentioned as an option, but Man Utd’s huge demand for Garnacho has ruled out a move to Bayer Leverkusen. The report adds:",
      "‘A price of £70million has been communicated to suitors, which is too high for Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "‘The German side had been linked, with their head coach Erik ten Hag having brought Garnacho through to the first team while in charge at Old Trafford, but they will not be pursuing an approach at that cost.’",
      "Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are also expected to leave Man Utd this summer, with the report claiming the latter’s potential exit is the ‘most advanced’ as ‘Real Betis wishes to turn his loan move into a permanent transfer’.",

      "Brentford forward Mbeumo has reportedly expressed his preference to join Ruben Amorim’s side and is unmoved by them being utter sh*te.",
      "He will not be the first to do so, nor the most expensive at around £60m. But he will find himself among these, the biggest ever signings involving a player joining a club lower in the Premier League.",

      "N’Golo Kante – £32m in July 2016",
      "From: Leicester (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (10th)",
      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi – £34m in August 2019",
      "From: Arsenal (5th)\nTo: Everton (8th)",
      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",

      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",

      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",

      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford.",

      "62) Radamel Falcao (£6.8m loan fee) (42)\nAnother player who joined with a huge reputation; Falcao failed to rediscover his FC Porto and Atletico Madrid form during his spell with Man Utd and then Chelsea.",
      "",
      "61) Antony (£80m) (16)\nThe Brazilian has been a catastrophic signing and Man Utd will be lucky to get £15m for him if he is put up for sale…is what we did say before an amazing loan spell at Real Betis. They might get £30m now. Still a huge loss but damage limitation and all that.",
      "",
      "60) Angel Di Maria (£67.5m) (43)\nJoining off the back of a man-of-the-match performance in a Champions League final, Di Maria flopped at Old Trafford. The only saving grace from his stint in Manchester is that the club recouped £56.7m when he was sold to PSG less than a year after arriving.",
      "",
      "59) Memphis Depay (£30.6m) (39)\nWearing the No. 7 shirt has become something of a curse since Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2009; even for the Portuguese himself.",
      "Depay came in as a terrific youngster from the Netherlands and took on the famous number. The forward scored seven goals in 53 games and left for Lyon for a little over half of what Man Utd paid for him.",
      "",
      "61) Morgan Schneiderlin (£31.5m) (37)\nSchneiderlin was great for Southampton, so Louis van Gaal brought him to Old Trafford where the Frenchman was nowhere near good enough. He left for £20m, so it’s not all bad. Bloody Everton.",
      "",
      "60) Martin Dubravka (£2m loan fee) (41)\nWhen Dubravka joined from Newcastle United, many expected him to feature in the Europa League group stage, but Dubravka only played three cup games before having his loan terminated in January. What a pointless transfer.",
      "",
      "59) Jack Butland (loan) (39)\nBrought in for the rest of the season in January 2022 after Dubravka’s loan ended. Butland did not make a single appearance for the club.",
      "",
      "58) Odion Ighalo (£10.8m loan fee) (34)\n£10m is a lot of money for a loan deal, especially when the player doesn’t improve the squad.",
      "",
      "57) Guillermo Varela (£2m) (33)\nThe Uruguayan right-back played four times in the Premier League for Man Utd.",
      "",
      "56) Donny van de Beek (£35m) (36)\nThe pain has finally ended for poor Van de Beek, who is officially free, joining Girona in the 2024 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "55) Bastian Schweinsteiger (£8m) (35)\nSchweinsteiger is a Bayern Munich legend and a forgettable Manchester United midfielder.",
      "",
      "54) Lee Grant (£1.5m) (31)\nFits the home-grown quota and joined Manchester United for no other reason.",
      "",
      "53) Victor Valdes (free) (30)\nBoth player and club could have done without this move.",
      "",
      "52) Paul Pogba (£94.5m) (38)\nPogba left United for Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, only to be re-signed by the Premier League club for a world-record transfer fee, to then return to Turin on a free transfer in 2022.",
      "He was excellent in fits and starts but nowhere near consistent enough.",
      "",
      "51) Harry Maguire (£78.3m) (41)\nOften the scapegoat and always mocked, the former Man Utd captain has put in many good displays for the club. However, the bad outweighs the good and as a result, he has not even come close to nearly justifying his hefty price tag.",
      "",
      "50) Tom Heaton (free) (29)\nSee Lee Grant. But Heaton was a free transfer.",
      "",
      "49) Dan James (£16m) (24)\nJames was never good enough for Man Utd and was probably only signed as he was seen as Young And Hungry. The best thing to come from his move is that they turned a rare profit when they sold him to Leeds United.",
      "",
      "48) Mason Mount (£55.4m) (22)\nHe cost an absolute fortune with only a year left on his Chelsea contract and even when fit, he has been very underwhelming.",
      "We all know the ability Mount possesses but we have not seen it since 2022, which is quite a while ago.",
      "",
      "47) Eric Bailly (£34m) (22)\nErratic and amusing, Bailly was signed for big money and was more of a comical than he was convincing at defending. Injuries didn’t help him, to be fair.",
      "",
      "46) Romelu Lukaku (£76m) (35)\nHe scored a decent amount of goals but didn’t do enough to merit a £76m transfer fee.",
      "",
      "45) Tahith Chong (free) (17)\nHaving paid no transfer fee for the young Dutch winger, Man Utd looked like they did pretty well. He didn’t get much of a chance and was sold to Birmingham City for £1.5m after a successful year on loan before getting his chance in the Premier League with Luton Town, who he did quite well for.",
      "The Red Devils were right to sell Chong but definitely could have got more for him.",
      "",
      "44) Timothy Fosu-Mensah (£342k) (28)\nFosu-Mensah was pretty cheap and the club turned a profit in the end. He made 30 first-team appearances and was quite useful due to his versatility.",
      "",
      "43) Matteo Darmian (£16m) (27)\nThe Italian was bang average for United and was only sold for £2m.",
      "",
      "42) Marcos Rojo (£18m) (25)\nOften erratic, Rojo was box office at times but had an average spell at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "41) Wout Weghorst (£2.6m loan fee) (23)\nWeghorst came in to fill a gap between January and June 2023 and was signed for peanuts, unlike Ighalo. Even still, it was a weird spell for everyone involved.",
      "",
      "40) Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£37.8m) (21)\nThe other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",
      "",
      "39) Hannibal Mejbri (£9m) (18)\nBought from Monaco in 2019, Mejbri spent the 22/23 campaign on loan at Birmingham and wasted the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla. He is now at Burnley in the Championship.",
      "",
      "38) Nemanja Matic (£40m) (23)\nMan Utd signed Matic four years too late.",
      "",
      "37) Facundo Pellistri (£7.6m) (20)\nThere was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m in the summer.",
      "",
      "36) Rasmus Hojlund (£64.7m) (17)\nIt’s make or break for Hojlund next season…if he’s still at the club.",
      "",
      "35) Tyrell Malacia (£13m) (15)\nMalacia quickly shifted Luke Shaw out of the starting XI before generously giving his spot back to the England international. Not a good signing, even for the price.",
      "",
      "34) Joshua Zirkzee (£36.5m) (26)\nZirkzee has had a horrible time of it since moving to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer. Ruben Amorim hung him out to dry with his first-half substitution against Newcastle. He actually bounced back pretty well but it would be very generous to say he looks like he belongs.",
      "",
      "33) Daley Blind (£15.7m) (16)\nBlind was a handy player to have. Versatile, consistent, rarely outstanding. He played over 140 times in four years at Old Trafford and is currently thriving at Girona.",
      "",
      "32) Alex Telles (£13.5m) (14)\nTelles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford. He joined Al Nassr permanently last July and is now playing for Botafogo.",
      "",
      "31) Marouane Fellaini (£29m) (26)\nFellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "30) Anthony Martial (£54m) (12)\nMartial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He joined AEK Athens on a free transfer in September.",
      "",
      "29) Sofyan Amrabat (£8.5m loan fee) (24)\nIf Amrabat played like he did in his last month at Old Trafford all season, he would be a lot higher.",
      "",
      "28) Victor Lindelof (£31.5m) (11)\nAnother expensive centre-half, Lindelof has not been a bad signing. But ‘not bad’ doesn’t really cut the mustard for Manchester United. After all, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. Leaving on a free transfer this summer. He’s so Turkish Super Lig, isn’t he?",
      "",
      "27) Patrick Dorgu (£25m) (NE)\nThe jury is most certainly out on this one.",
      "",
      "26) Manuel Ugarte (£42.3m) (23)\nA signing that looks amazing on paper, Ugarte is not up to speed yet.",
      "",
      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£49.5m) (40)\nWan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "24) Matthijs de Ligt (£38.4m) (24)\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another.",
      "",
      "23) Raphael Varane (£36m) (7)\nVarane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como in the summer and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "22) Sergio Romero (free) (8)\nAs far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "21) Andre Onana (£45.2m) (11)\nUpgrading on David de Gea should have been Ten Hag’s top priority when he took over and it took him a year to realise the Spaniard needed to be replaced. Do not be blinded by his 2022/23 Golden Glove.",
      "We thought Onana would be a big upgrade on De Gea but that’s not been the case. He makes far too many errors and his distribution is shaky, despite that being a compelling reason for ditching DDG for him.",
      "",
      "20) Jonny Evans (free) (38)\nIt is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "19) Leny Yoro (£52m) (12)\nYoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "18) Marcel Sabitzer (loan) (21)\nAs far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "17) Ayden Heaven (£1.5m) (NE)\nHe might already be United’s best centre-half.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Cunha (£62.5m) (NE)\nSurely…surely this can’t go wrong.",
      "",
      "15) Juan Mata (£40m) (15)\nDavid Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "14) Fred (£53m) (10)\nA few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club.",
      "£53m is still pretty bloody steep, mind.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Eriksen (free) (4)\nA lot of us fancied Eriksen to be the bargain of the 2022/23 campaign and his transfer fee – or lack of – is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Will leave for nothing this summer.",
      "",
      "12) Edinson Cavani (free) (9)\nSeventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "11) Amad Diallo (£19m) (19)\nAfter a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was being written off by many (myself included). However, his time with Sunderland was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which is beginning to look like decent value for money…finally.",
      "",
      "10) Lisandro Martinez (£50m) (5)\nMartinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. The Argentine World Cup winner attracted interest from Arsenal before joining the Red Devils and it is clear to see why. His return from injury at the end of 2023/24 helped Ten Hag win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (£32m) (6)\nHerrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "8) Noussair Mazraoui (£12.8m) (17)\nHe is comfortably the best signing Man Utd made last summer.",
      "",
      "7) Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) (4)\nThere’s not a lot to say that has not already been said. £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "6) Casemiro (£61.5m) (3)\nAfter spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was sitting right there willing to slot straight into their midfield.",
      "This is such a weird one now. In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25, he was one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "At this stage, the Red Devils shouldn’t be too bothered about what transfer fee they get; it’s all about getting Casemiro’s monstrous contract off the books. We’re not sure Saudi Arabia are even that stupid.",
      "",
      "5) Luke Shaw (£33.7m) (3)\nFitness issues and injuries have been the bane of Shaw’s Manchester United career.",
      "",
      "4) Diogo Dalot (£19.8m) (13)\nDalot’s time at the club looked up in the summer of 2021 with Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma circling, however, he has since established himself as the club’s first-choice right-back ahead of Wan-Bissaka, before it became the flip of a coin for Ten Hag.",
      "",
      "3) Alejandro Garnacho (£400k) (10)\nWhat a bargain and Man Utd intend to make some lovely profit in the summer.",
      "",
      "2) Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) (2)\nThis is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 63 players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (£56.7m) (1)\nAlthough his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",
      "He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and a rare bit of great business by the Red Devils. It will take a lot to bump him off top spot – especially after he proved his loyalty by snubbing silly Saudi Arabian money to stay.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United star is on the brink of leaving the Premier League side as he has ‘said yes’ to a move to a European giant.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are in ‘direct contact’ over a swap deal ‘solution’ with Serie A giants Juventus regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "A Manchester United transfer reportedly hinges on one condition, while a Red Devils star has been pictured wearing the shirt of a rival Premier League club.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’.",
      "Juventus have joined Serie A champions Napoli in the race to bring in a Premier League winger in the summer transfer window.",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award."

      "",
      "9) Brighton – £51.3m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos, and the 21-year-old Diego Coppola.",

      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £131m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. And the splurge is not done yet with at least Milos Kerkez to follow."

      "Mbeumo is said to be keen on a move to Old Trafford despite interest from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham, and having had an opening bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rejected by Brentford, they’ve now returned with a second offer ‘in excess of £60m’, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "It’s claimed United bosses ‘have been working in the background to find an agreement with Brentford’ as they ‘did not want to be dragged into repeated bids’ for the 25-year-old.",
      "Despite those supposed close conversations with their Premier League rivals ‘it remains unclear whether that latest offer has been accepted’ as the Red Devils look to ‘accelerate’ the deal to get the Cameroon star on board for pre-season with the players due to report back to Carrington from the week commencing July 7.",

      "It’s claimed the ‘loss of prominence’ last season as Marcus Rashford often started ahead of him, as well as the ‘unclear technical decisions’ of Unai Emery may have ‘sown doubts’ in the mind of Watkins amid United’s interest.",
      "A number of forwards look set to leave Old Trafford this summer, with Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all told that they will not be welcome on their tour of the USA in July, while the Red Devils are also open to offers for Rasmus Hojlund amid interest from Serie A.",

      "Troy Deeney has urged Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes to “smash” Alejandro Garnacho in training after the winger stirred up controversy by wearing a rival club’s shirt while on holiday.",
      "Garnacho, currently on a break in Ibiza, posted a photo of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt belonging to Marcus Rashford, a move that has infuriated sections of the Man Utd fanbase and baffled pundits.",
      "Rashford, recently on loan at Villa, is also expected to leave Old Trafford this summer, speaking of his desire to play with Lamine Yamal at Barcelona.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, presenter Shebahn Aherne questioned why Garnacho would risk such a public stunt amid uncertainty over his Utd future.",
      "“Did you see that picture of Garnacho wearing the Rashford Villa shirt on holiday? The guy is an absolute wind-up,” she said. “Why would you not try to fall into line when you’re trying to make your way back into the manager’s good books?",
      "“That’s the most immature thing I’ve seen from Garnacho. It’s so immature. I didn’t think you’d get that from Garnacho.",
      "“What are you doing? Why are you trying to wind everyone up and wind up the club that’s paying your wages?”",
      "Former Watford striker Deeney didn’t hold back in his response either.",
      "“They obviously think they’ve got a move lined up. It’s a new generation so I’ve got to be careful not to sound like the old, grumpy man,” he said.",
      "“But he needs a clip around the ear. Give him a clip around the ear. He’s bored and has got no respect.",
      "“If it was me at United, if I was Fernandes, I’d wait until he came back and smash him in training. I genuinely would.",
      "“I’m not even trying to make headlines, I’d smash him and say to him, ‘this is Man United, who do you think you are you little dope?’”",
      "Garnacho was once viewed as one of the club’s brightest young stars but endured a frustrating 2024-25 campaign. He fell down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim, and the new manager is understood to have told him he is free to leave if a suitable offer arrives.",
      "His limited minutes and unwillingness to adapt tactically, particularly in terms of defensive work rate, have reportedly contributed to Amorim’s decision. Garnacho is believed to be unhappy with his role, and the relationship between player and manager appears strained.",
      "Former Utd full-back Paul Parker recently echoed Deeney’s sentiments, suggesting the time has come for Garnacho to move on.",
      "“Garnacho has to go. There’s no way around it, because things will never work out at Manchester United. He doesn’t have the right mentality, and he doesn’t like to work hard. I don’t think that will ever change,” Parker told Tipsbladet.",
      "“It’s unbelievable because his idol, Ronaldo, was the complete opposite. He worked his ass off, so if Ronaldo really is his idol, then I think he should model himself a bit more on him and do what he does.",
      "“He needs a bit of fresh air, he needs a change of environment, and I think he could benefit from a move to another country.",
      "“Maybe going somewhere else will help him grow up and take on some responsibility. I think it’s become clear that his family isn’t good for him when it comes to football, so maybe a move with a new agent and some new advisors could help him too.”",
      "Both Napoli and Chelsea are said to be monitoring Garnacho’s situation, with Utd open to negotiating a sale if the right bid comes in. As it stands, few would be surprised if the Villa shirt incident proves to be one of his final acts as a Utd player.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "A Manchester United transfer reportedly hinges on one condition, while a Red Devils star has been pictured wearing the shirt of a rival Premier League club.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea are targeting eight players for two positions, including four Premier League stars, to revamp Maresca’s attack as Mudryk faces a four-year ban.",
      "Chelsea are now reportedly ‘discussing a loan to buy’ move for the Man Utd star, with ‘more and more noise’ emerging over his transfer this week."

      "‘In this context, adding Rashford would only increase competition in an already crowded area of ​​the pitch, which could generate internal tensions and hinder the development of key players like Lamine and Ferran. Furthermore, Rashford’s own inconsistency in recent months raises doubts about his immediate fit with Flick’s proposed style.’",

      "It’s fair to say that Liverpool fans are giddy about Florian Wirtz and their summer transfers, even if rival fans want to remind them of Chelsea.",
      "Send your views to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Apologies Richard Hughes\nI’m not sure how many contributors write in to offer an apology, but after a scorching (and hungover) Sunday morning run while catching up on podcasts, I feel I owe Liverpool’s Director of Football, Richard Hughes, a sincere one. So Richard, I apologise for doubting you. Not that you’d care one jot.",
      "It’s now clear that far from being paralysed with fear à la Roy Hodgson, that you, along with Michael Edwards and the data team have been meticulously laying the groundwork for what might turn out to be our most significant transfer window in six years, if not ever.",
      "I’m absolutely astonished we’ve landed Wirtz, the best player on the market this year. Like many fans, I’m dying to know what Arne Slot said to convince him to choose Anfield. Over pints at the pub this weekend, a few mates and I concluded it might’ve just been three simple words: “My Bobby Firmino.”",
      "On top of that, the potential replacements of Trent, Robbo, Diaz, and Alisson with Wirtz, Frimpong, Kerkez, and Mamardashvili drop the average age of our starting XI from 26.7 to 24.3. That’s no small feat, and it’s been done quickly and quietly.",
      "Now, I can’t wrap this up without a gentle jab at our rivals.",
      "I love how certain respected journalists continue to cozy up to Sir Alex Ferguson by framing the signings of Cunha and possibly Mbeumo as proof Man United still have pulling power. Hmm. Back in SAF’s day, they’d have been in for Wirtz and prising Nico Williams out of Spain. Now, they’re celebrating buying the best player from a side that finished below them, who spent 77.6% of the season walking (for comparison, VVD was 76%). Oh, and he gets a 67% pay rise for the privilege. It’s not quite taking Margot Robbie home!!",
      "As for Arsenal, their current blend of self-righteousness and transfer window anxiety is best summed up not by me, but by Paddy Power’s Instagram feed. Nothing I write here could possibly top that.",
      "And to Manchester (115) City and Chelsea, enjoy being pawns in Infantino’s U.S. experiment while Salah, Mac Allister, and Gravenberch are recovering on a beach somewhere. I’m sure playing in 35°C heat all July will have zero effect on your squad fitness come spring.",

      "Nobody wins the transfer window\nA few days ago, another reader wrote in claiming the Club World Cup was going to be the second-best club tournament in the world – after berating English fans as being biased against the tournament and lauding the teams (South American) who were taking it seriously. Ironic that he didn’t consider that those same teams might consider their equivalent of the Champions League – the Copa Libertadores – as either the best or, at worst, second-best club competition. No?",
      "Of course, being mid-season probably helps those clubs – still early enough in their season, they are fresh, while having a chance to gel as a team. Compared to those from Europe who have played non-stop for almost 11 months, and with the international break and bedding in new players, it will take a game or two to get back up to speed. Notwithstanding the heat they are dealing with.",
      "On that topic. I am reading about how baseball players are throwing up, needing to be withdrawn, and requiring misting and hydration stations to survive games. And this is in a sport that doesn’t require the same level of endurance, stamina, and cardiovascular exertion. Of course, this was all predictable. Not a great portent for next year’s World Cup. Not sure what’s worse though, all the fawning over the competition by pundits, totally ignoring all the issues or the competition itself.",
      "Lastly, no one wins a transfer window. It’s exciting when new players are brought in. I get it. But if past transfer windows are any gauge…just recently, Chelsea acquired 12 players in 2023, including Jackson, Palmer, Caicado and Lavia, with many Chelsea fans lauding ‘winning’ Caicedo and Lavia over Liverpool. But Liverpool did better during that season and the following year won the league with just one signing to Chelsea’s 10 signings.",
      "Some assumptions around Liverpool doing well are for signings that haven’t yet happened but might happen. And what if any of those new guys, particularly Wirtz gets injured? Frimpong is not a like-for-like exchange for TAA, and his defending stats are actually worse. Kerkez isn’t a Liverpool player yet, and Wirtz still has to be slotted (pun intended) into the current team without disrupting what worked well last season.",
      "The point is, there is a long way to go. City and Chelsea have a chance to get some early pre-season in for new players, as they are going to have a shorter traditional pre-season.",
      "For United fans bemoaning little transfer action so far, it isn’t just related to the quality of the management team in place (which is poor to be fair) but the fact that once you drop down a level, have no Champions League draw card and have to reduce the wage budget – as the past overpaying for mediocre players takes its toll – means waiting until the ‘big boys’ have had their pick of the crop.",
      "While things could be turned around – as other teams have shown – picking an only-one-way-to-play manager, playing a style that doesn’t suit most of the current squad and hasn’t shown itself to be that effective, was probably the worst decision the club could have made at this point. He’s not a draw card either. So while I said there’s no winning a transfer season, Utd are going to show the downside of being the ‘second best’ in this case.\nPaul McDevitt",

      "Big up yourselves and leave Liverpool flop talk\nWhilst there’s not much football to watch. although the U21’s game was a good watch (why do they keep losing the ball 30/40 yards from goal!} and the CWC is a grossly inflated pre-season friendly tournament, the mailbox and comments section are dominated by talk of transfers and next season.",
      "There are always people who treat all supporters of other teams with petty prejudices and outlandish generalisations, there also exists a large group of people who I would say is far more common and exemplifies an awful lot of fans, it’s the “it’s more important you fail, than we succeed” band.",
      "All teams will spend or have spent money in the belief that there squad will be improved, some clubs will sell their prized assets but will aim to re-invest this in other hidden gems. And yet, rather than talk up their team’s chances of a better season than last, a large number of people are fixated on the potential “flops” of their rivals.",
      "Man City have spent in excess of £400mil since the turn of the year and have signed a fabulous forward from the Bundesliga, the “midfielder of the season” from Serie A, a French “wonderkid” and some others at around the £40mil mark. Chelsea have bought a centre forward who may able to stay on the pitch for more than four minutes. Arsenal are seeking the mythical “centre forward” that has cost them the last three titles and a world class DM to allow Declan Rice to flourish. Even ManU look to have upgraded on their mis-firing forward line and are not finished yet.",
      "Despite this, quite a number seem pre-occupied with talking about how much Liverpool’s signings may “flop”. The fact that last season’s champions have (to use comments from last season) replaced a right back who can’t defend, an over the hill left back, signed a creative ball playing midfielder/forward to replace their non creative, non goalscoring, stagnant midfield and appear to be keen to add a centre forward to replace their megaflop and possibly strengthen their centre back options, would worry me immensely if I supported any other team.",
      "I know people will/can be ridiculed if they make big statements (e.g. the title is won already) but surely any “normal” supporter should be saying, “our signings have made us better, our signings will mean we will do better than last season”, otherwise, what’s the point, talk about your team, your hopes and dreams, don’t tie yourself up in knots wishing others to fail, embrace your own possibilities!",
      "Unfortunately this is not new, many (many) years ago, I asked a friend who supported a team in blue what his hopes were for the coming season, his initial response was, “I hope you don’t win anything”!\nHoward (is the quad on?) Jones",

The teams are all under strengthen in comparison to the actual eligible players.  Spain are not fielding Yamal for example. So the results of the tournament are not exactly one-to-one match ups with World Cup or Euro results.",
      "But there’s obviously something qualitative that happens to dip between the U21 and senior England teams. Not just the inevitable drop off subtracting merely talented footballers with the absolute top of approximately 24 players remaining. Have the U21 players simply got things to prove still and peak as teens? While the senior players are just maintaining earned privileged status and a lavish mortgage?",
      "The game is also trending young btw. Especially with the Mbappe example of 2018 World Cup which he’s not repeated once he got the fame and big salary. Yamal wins the Euros at 16-17 and may be on the same trajectory as Mbappe, not likely to repeat the international feats of his teen years in his 20s.",
      "Historically European players are said to peak around 26-27 blending their gifts with hard won experience. Recent international football results have been produced by fast fast running teenagers who cheekily trounce slightly older men.",

      "PSG’s Warren Zaire-Emery, Barcelona’s Marc Casado and Real Madrid’s Eduardo Camavinga represent unlikely options thought to be of interest to Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, with Agoume a more realistic option along with Lille’s teen sensation Ayyoub Bouaddi.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes has confirmed that Arsenal see Agoume – whose game has been compared to N’Golo Kante – ‘as an interesting option for its balance between physical, tactical criteria and projection’.",
      "The report claims ‘Arsenal seems to be the closest destination’ but with ‘nothing closed yet’, both Tottenham and Manchester United have entered the race.",
      "‘Tottenham see in Agoume an opportunity to add a young and versatile profile in the centre of the field’, while United ‘consider the Frenchman an alternative to rebuild an area of the team that showed many shortcomings last season’ after a less than impressive first campaign for £42m Manuel Ugarte.",
      "It’s claimed that without European football the Red Devils will ‘seduce the player with minutes and a solid project’…",
      "United are also desperate to land a new striker after a poor season for Rasmus Hojlund, who’s been heavily linked with a move to Serie A, and after top target Viktor Gyokeres confirmed he has no interest in a move to Old Trafford, a very surprising move for Everton’s Beto – who moved to Goodison Park for £21m from Udinese in 2023 – has been mooted by the president of Uniao Tires, the striker’s first club.",
      "“Everyone thought Amorim would sign Gyokeres as he had him at Sporting, but the Premier League is completely different to Portugal,” Lopes told The Sun.",
      "“Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it is quicker and more competitive. Gyokeres would struggle to play as a lone No 9 waiting for service.",
      "“Beto’s a more physical player, who fights with defenders and doesn’t lose duels. He is a real headache for opponents — if he gets the service. In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces but haven’t had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there is an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "“Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate — plus he is very fast. When Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he is for defenders to stop. He’d be like Amorim’s ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.”"

      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Omar Berrada: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course. We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it?\"",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",
