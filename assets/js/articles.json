      "Premier League clubs are due to vote on the potential to introduce rules capping spending on playing squads, but concerns are growing that the concept may be adopted by the Championship.",
      "On November 21 the clubs will vote on top-to-bottom anchoring (TBA), which would cap the amount any club could spend on their squad at five times the smallest central Premier League broadcasting and prize money payout.",
      "In theory the move will create more competition and stop a club at the top with huge wealth spending sums that a newly promoted club could only dream of. Those in opposition of TBA say it would effectively create a salary cap with both Manchester clubs and Aston Villa voting against looking at it further last April.",
      "Now clubs who would be deemed mid-table outfits or lower are becoming concerned that the idea could be taken on lower down the pyramid. Whilst they're in the top flight they are, generally, in favour of it, because it brings them closer to the top clubs.",
      "But were any team to be relegated to the Championship they would have the benefit of parachute payments and, theoretically, be among the richest teams in the second tier. But their ability to reinvest ahead of a promotion push would be limited if their spending is limited to five times that of the lowest team.",
      "EFL chairman Rick Parry has spoken in the past about parachute payments creating huge inequality in the Championship and would certainly look at having TBA introduced if the Premier League adopted it.",
      "The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) is also opposed to the idea and has enlisted legal help to support its challenge. They have warned the Premier League it would be in \"flagrant breach\" of rules requiring it to consult. ESPN reports that the TBA proposal will be dropped before the meeting or fail to gain sufficient support in a vote.",
      "Clubs also need to decide whether they want to stick with the existing, but still divisive, profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) or replace them with the new squad cost rules (SCR).",
      "SCR would bring Premier League clubs into closer alignment with UEFA regulations and have been on trial in shadow form since the start of last season.",
      "On the European scene clubs can only spend up to 70 percent of revenue on squad-related costs. The Premier League proposal is to introduce a limit of 85 percent for those not involved in European competition. Some though argue it would bring about a stronger correlation between success and revenue.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s shock 2-1 win over Liverpool appears to have breathed fresh life into their season when all hope seemed lost. Ruben Amorim’s Red Devils fought hard against the reigning Premier League champions to clinch their first victory at Anfield since January 2016 on Sunday.",
      "Despite all of the recent talk surrounding his potential sacking, Amorim’s side got off to a flying start as Bryan Mbeumo finished clinically to open the scoring inside two minutes. Both sides went on to miss big chances before Cody Gakpo equalised from close range with just over ten minutes left to play.",
      "But it was United that dealt the final blow as Harry Maguire rose to head home Bruno Fernandes’ cross and secure all three points just minutes later. One of the standout contributors to Amorim’s first successive league triumphs was Senne Lammens, as we now take a look at two major headlines surrounding the in-form goalkeeper.",
      "The 23-year-old shot-stopper, who arrived from Royal Antwerp at the end of the summer transfer window for £18million, has stepped up to replace the much-criticised and recently-departed Andre Onana in recent weeks. The win at Anfield marked just his second start for United, though Lammens has already benefitted from Amorim’s managerial skills.",
      "Discussing his under-fire head coach, Lammens noted Amorim’s ability to take all of the pressure off his players during times of hardship, which has helped the Belgian come into his own.",
      "Lammens said: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Lammens was signed in the summer despite the Red Devils being linked with far more established names such as Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa and Gianluigi Donnarumma, who ended up joining rivals Manchester City. That was due to his younger age profile and relatively meagre wages.",
      "However, Lammens had to be patient in his first month with the English giants, having been left on the bench for September’s three clashes in favour of the shaky Altay Bayindir. That patience appears to have paid off, with club legend Rio Ferdinand seeing enough from Lammens’ Liverpool performance to speak highly of the youngster.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents after the game, the former defender said: \"He’s only played two games, I don’t want to get carried away, but in the two games he’s played, he’s been very dependable, and that’s the word you want with your goalkeeper.\"",
      "Ferdinand added five glowing words to describe the new United goalkeeper. \"Safe, dependable, assured, assertive, calm,\" he said \"These types of words are what you want with your goalkeeper. Long may that continue because that then instils confidence in the back line.\"",
      "Sunday’s match winner Maguire echoed that same sentiment by saying post-match: \"I must say I am heavily impressed by Senne Lammens. I don’t want to get carried away because he is playing in the position with the most pressure, it’s the most difficult position at Manchester United. But he’s got everything. Great personality.\"",

      "Fulham are set to open formal talks with manager Marco Silva over a new contract. Silva, 48, has enjoyed four successful years at Craven Cottage, while he was recently linked with Manchester United amid question marks surrounding Ruben Amorim's long-term future.",
      "The ex-Everton and Watford boss took charge of Fulham in 2021, winning promotion from the Championship in his first season as title winners. Since then, Silva has helped Fulham establish themselves as Premier League mainstays and was rewarded with a new contract in 2023.",
      "That deal, which includes a release clause in the region of £15million, expires at the end of this season. According to The Athletic, however, Fulham's ownership have told the Portuguese that they want to offer him an extension.",
      "Detailed talks over the prospective contract are yet to take place, as Fulham chiefs continue to prioritise on-field matters. But the report explains that there's goodwill on both sides.",
      "As well as being linked with United, Nottingham Forest considered an approach for Silva before then turning to out-of-work Sean Dyche, who's expected to succeed Ange Postecoglou in the City Ground hot-seat. The 48-year-old previously worked under Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis as Olympiacos manager - while the two maintain a friendship.",
      "Speaking before Saturday's narrow 1-0 loss at home to leaders Arsenal - their third consecutive defeat - Silva was quizzed on his future. Fulham owner Shahid Khan was in town, having flown over from the United States to watch his NFL team, the Jacksonville Jaguars, play at Wembley.",
      "Silva replied by confirming that Khan had informed him that he's still his man to lead Fulham. \"I've met him already,\" the Cottagers boss explained. \"The main reason was not just the contract, we have many things to talk about.",
      "\"I've felt always part of this football club, from the first day until day. Like the players, it's normal they (other clubs) show interest in myself and my staff. It's a normal situation. (But) Full focus on us and working with the club on the future, too.",
      "\"I've been here five years, why not more. It (the contract situation) is not gonig to be something that disrupts our season. If I have to, I'll speak with you (about it) every single week as well.",
      "\"I think it's not necessary to speak every week about it. The right time to speak, it will arrive.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo was overcome with joy when Harry Maguire netted the decisive goal in Manchester United's win over Liverpool. Anfield was a cauldron of tension on Sunday, as Ruben Amorim's team took on Arne Slot's Premier League champions in the north west derby.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo put United ahead just two minutes into the match-up, slipping the ball past Giorgi Mamardashvili from close range before then celebrating wildly in front of the Kop. Despite Cody Gakpo sneaking in to equalise 78 minutes into the game, Liverpool were denied a share of the spoils.",
      "Six minutes later, England defender Maguire headed home at the far post, securing a hard-fought win for United over their fiercest rivals. The away fans naturally exploded with delight - and United's official social media account caught Amorim's animated reaction to the goal.",
      "The clip also captured Mainoo's ecstatic response, as he was lifted into the air by a member of the Reds' coaching staff, his face beaming with happiness. It occurred just moments before Mainoo was brought on as a replacement for Bruno Fernandes - as Amorim sought to preserve the advantage his team had secured.",
      "And that's precisely what United managed, withstanding a relentless Liverpool assault that continued throughout the eight minutes of additional time. Following that triumph, United rose to ninth in the Premier League standings, boasting four wins, three defeats and one draw from their first eight matches.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, endured their fourth successive loss in the encounter, having entered the clash following defeats to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea. United now benefit from a week's respite before hosting Brighton at Old Trafford - with clashes against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham away from home scheduled before the November international break.",
      "Reflecting on the victory after the full-time whistle , Amorim said: \"Every day is special, but of course, this was a very special win. To see our fans singing during the game, in one moment, the biggest rival, they are champions on their field, in their stadium.",
      "\"This win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team - because I believe that we can play so much better. We will try to analyse the game in the same way that we analyse the other ones.",
      "\"Try to see the good things and the bad things, but for me the special thing is the togetherness that they showed during this game. That is special for me.\"",
      "Slot, however, will not have the same break that United have been afforded ahead of their next match-up. That's because Liverpool return to the fold to face Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League on Wednesday evening.",
      "When asked if the current run of poor form has had an impact on his confidence as a manager following a loss to United, the Dutchman said: \"I think as a manager you face constantly challenges. When I just started, you face the challenge of being a new manager and then you need to win games.",
      "\"Then when you do well you go to a bigger club and people are like; 'Oh, let's see how he does over there.' Then you go to be the successor of Jurgen Klopp and people say this is the biggest challenge you ever faced. Now we have lost four times in a row and that's also a challenge.",
      "\"So, the life of a football manager is an ongoing challenge. If you win games you want to keep winning, if you lose games you want to start winning again. Do we lose confidence? I can't see it yet, because every single game we've lost, we were able to create in the second half an unbelievable amount of chances.",
      "\"If you look back at all the three games we've lost in the Premier League, if you just put all the highlights [next to] each other, you would say it's hardly possible that they lose this game. So if we can keep producing what we are doing and do a few things a little bit better, then there is every reason to expect that we will start to win football games again.",
      "\"But I can't promise you that on Wednesday evening we are again able to create eight, nine or 10 open chances. I hope so - and with the players we have then it will lead in the end to us scoring more goals.\"",

      "Having netted 20 Premier League goals last season, the 26-year-old joined Ruben Amorim's squad following extensive negotiations. Thus far, Mbeumo has found the net twice in the Premier League for United and was amongst their goal-scorers in Sunday's 2-1 triumph over Liverpool.",
      "The striker capitalised on Amad's pass - within the opening two minutes - before defeating Giorgi Mamardashvili. Cody Gakpo levelled matters for the Premier League champions in the 78th minute before Harry Maguire struck a decisive blow to secure United's first Anfield success in almost a decade.",
      "Previously, Rooney confessed that he had harboured doubts around Mbeumo's capacity to flourish at Old Trafford. However, after emerging as one of Amorim's most threatening assets, the ex-United forward has acknowledged his initial assessment was mistaken.",
      "\"For me he [Mbuemo] has been Manchester United's stand-out players this season and he hasn't got his rewards for his hard work and the sacrifices he's made for the team,\" he said on his BBC Podcast. \"It was a great goal.",
      "\"I'll be honest I was a bit sceptical when United signed him, I don't know if he had the ability to come and play for Manchester United, but he's proved me wrong. I think he's been a great addition to the team and is by far United's best player of the season.\"",
      "Rooney also showered praise on United head coach Amorim following his successive Premier League triumphs since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November. \"It's such a huge win for the manager,\" he continued.",
      "\"I've questioned decisions, I've questioned tactics, I've questioned players' desire over this season and last season. That win is massive. To win at Anfield is not easy to do.",

      "Manchester United cult hero Diego Forlan was rushed to hospital with three broken ribs and a partially collapsed lung after a nasty fall during an over-40s match in Uruguay. Forlan, 46, was playing for Old Boys against Old Christians on Saturday afternoon.",
      "The ex-United striker reportedly fell awkwardly following an aerial collision with an opposition player. Forlan was visibly in pain on the turf and a video recorded from the sidelines shows several of his team-mates running over.",
      "After being transported to a nearby hospital, doctors had to drain his lung because fluid had entered it. The incident 'gave everyone a scare', according to Uruguayan outlet El Observador, but he's now in a 'good condition' and has no qualms with his opponent.",
      "Forlan, who'd scored two goals to help Old Boys win 4-1, reportedly sent a message to friends via WhatsApp from his hospital bed. \"They're going to admit me and put a tube in to drain the blood,\" the former Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan and Villareal forward wrote.",
      "\"I'll be hospitalised until Tuesday. In 20 years as a professional, this has never happened to me before.",
      "\"It wasn't his fault. The truth is, it wasn't his fault. He knocked me off balance and I was in the air, you see? And my hand stayed there… I couldn't get it out to support myself. I fell like a sack of potatoes.\"",
      "Forlan announced his retirement from professional football in August 2019, having briefly played for Kitchee in the Hong Kong Premier League in which he scored seven goals in five games. But in a surprise career change, the 46-year-old is now a professional tennis player, making his ATP debut at the 2024 Uruguay Open.",
      "\"I need something where I can run,\" Forlan explained in an interview with the Athletic. \"Golf, you play in beautiful places – I like it and I still do it, but I need something different, something more similar to football.",
      "\"I started training and playing tennis and I was getting better and better. At first, I would play the top players at the club and players from around Uruguay and it was easy for them to beat me.",
      "\"Then it became more difficult. Now I can win. At the club tournaments, I was losing in the first round, now I'm winning a lot of them.\"",
      "Forlan spent three-and-a-half years at United, with Sir Alex Ferguson having signed him from Atletico Independiente for £6.9million in January 2002. The Uruguayan scored 17 goals across 98 appearances at Old Trafford before being sold to Villarreal in a £2m deal.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "Six years ago, Manchester United and Liverpool played out a Premier League draw at Old Trafford, Adam Lallana’s late goal cancelling out a first-half opener from Marcus Rashford. And Roy Keane was furious.",
      "He was furious before the match had even started because he had watched live footage of the two sets of players being convivial in the tunnel. They were embracing each other.",
      "“I’m disgusted,” he said. “You’re going to war … (and) they are hugging and kissing. Don’t even look at the opposition. You’re going into battle with them. Chat to them after the game - or don’t even chat to them after the game.”",
      "In the contest that followed, referee Martin Atkinson produced his yellow card only once, sanctioning Fabinho for a cynical foul on Dan James. Presumably to Keane’s chagrin, there was certainly no war.",
      "And, in this fixture, there have been few wars since. For the first time in some considerable time, I was not at the latest instalment of the Liverpool-Manchester United rivalry, often billed as, arguably, the fiercest in sport. Occasionally, through the TV, it sounded as though there was a feisty atmosphere in the stadium, but on the field, it was hardly fierce.",
      "Remember the days when some Liverpool and United players looked like they might get booked in the warm-up? Remember when Steven Gerrard was sent off 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute for stamping on Ander Herrera?",
      "There has been the odd nasty moment since the pre-match love-in that sent Keane into meltdown - VAR upgraded Paul Pogba’s two-footer on Naby Keita in October, 2021, to a straight red - but not many. Fierce? In terms of the tempo of the game, maybe.",
      "Fierce? When referring to the supporters, definitely. But in physicality and enmity on the pitch? Hardly.",
      "Not a single Liverpool player was booked in Sunday’s 2-1 defeat. In fact, over the past 11 Premier League meetings between these two teams, Liverpool have collected only 13 yellow cards.",
      "Of course, discipline has been a big part of Liverpool’s superiority over United in recent times, the latter averaging over three yellows a game in those 11 meetings, with Pogba and Diogo Dalot (two yellows) seeing red. (Amad Diallo got a second yellow for taking off his shirt to celebrate a late FA Cup winner a couple of seasons ago).",
      "But watching remotely at the weekend, it was striking to see how little needle there appeared to be. And this is a trend that is not just confined to Liverpool and United’s rivalry.",
      "For a spell, the mutual disrespect between Liverpool and Manchester City supporters seemed quite intense. And the teams have produced some memorable contests in recent times.",
      "But aggro on the pitch? In their last six Premier League meetings, there have been a total of 16 yellow cards. They often look like pals, which, as it happens, a lot of them are. Mates and neighbours.",
      "That might have something to do with the relatively good spirit in which the Liverpool-United and Liverpool-City games seem to be played nowadays. But a more significant reason is surely that VAR has become established and anyone thinking of a challenge that could be bookable knows there could be more serious consequences.",
      "With VAR, a yellow can become red with a few looks at a TV monitor. And yes, that’s a good thing. No-one wants to see tackles that endanger an opponent’s safety.",
      "Yes, that’s a good thing. Everyone likes to see a match being played in a good spirit. But it’s still hard not to think one of the fiercest rivalries in football has gone a little bit tame.",

      "Paul Scholes had suggested that he lacked the athleticism required to excel at United just days before the fixture. But, following the encounter, McTominay lauded Shaw's contribution on social media.",
      "The Scotland international posted on Instagram with a brief three-word message, writing: \"What a player\" under Shaw's own Instagram upload. Shaw began the contest and was withdrawn in the 85th minute for Leny Yoro, as Liverpool sought to increase their aerial threat in the penalty area.",
      "It proved a memorable afternoon for Shaw and his team-mates, who had to resist wave after wave of Liverpool pressure in the dying stages of the encounter. Sadly for McTominay, it wasn't such a positive weekend for him and his Napoli colleagues, though.",
      "The midfielder sustained an injury prior to the match and he was forced to observe from the touch-line as his side suffered a 1-0 defeat to Torino, marking their second league loss of the season. The setback saw them drop to third in the standings, although sitting just one point behind table-toppers AC Milan.",
      "Amorim was delighted with his own side's performance, securing one of his most impressive victories since taking charge. The triumph also marked United's first consecutive pair of Premier League wins under his leadership.",
      "Speaking after the match, the Portuguese manager said: \"Every day is special [as United boss]. But this was a very special win.",
      "\"To see our fans singing during the game, in a moment that the biggest rivals are champions - on their field and at their stadium - this win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team. I believe we can play so much better.",
      "\"We will analyse the game in the same way we analyse the other ones, try to see the good things and bad things. But, for me, the togetherness they [the players] showed during this game, that'is special for me.\"",
      "The victory propelled United into the upper half of the standings. Following defeats in three of their first six fixtures, their double-helping of Premier League wins leaves them just two points off the top four spots - while they'll be aiming to make it three for three when Brighton and Hove Albion visit Old Trafford on Saturday, October 25.",

      "\"We knew that Liverpool had weaknesses, and that's their full-backs,\" he admitted to ViaPlay. \"We were all really hyped, and the focus was very high. Today was a game that you really have to be concentrated in.\"",
      "One moment that summed up Liverpool’s afternoon came in the second-half when an attempted clearance from Van Dijk smacked off the face of Kerkez and went over the bar. And former Premier League midfielder Craig Burley has taken aim at the way the Dutchman reacted.",
      "“Virgil van Dijk, to me, is not leading at the moment. He’s blaming,” he told ESPN FC. “Kerkez is having a bad time, there’s no doubt about it.",
      "“He’s getting swallowed up by the pressure of going in with these big players in this huge football club with these big expectations, but I don’t think it helps when your captain’s looking at him every two minutes and blaming him or digging him out.",

      "Further question marks over Liverpool's two most expensive summer signings in Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz have been raised after Arne Slot's side fell to a fourth consecutive defeat against Manchester United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Isak, 26, was the final - and most expensive - acquisition of an unprecedented summer of spending from the Premier League champions, who broke the British transfer record twice to land the former Newcastle striker and Wirtz, the latter joining in a deal worth £116m from Bayer Leverkusen back in June.",
      "Unfortunately for Liverpool and Slot, both Isak and Wirtz have failed to hit the ground running in the early weeks of the season, with scrutiny growing on both players in the wake of another loss for the Reds.",
      "Wirtz has failed to register a goal contribution in his first 10 appearances in a Liverpool shirt and started a second successive Premier League game on the bench against United. Isak, meanwhile, looked off the pace after taking no part in pre-season for Newcastle. But while Slot says now is the time to judge Isak after stressing that the Sweden star is now up to speed, Wayne Rooney believes the former Real Sociedad star should not currently be first-choice ahead of Hugo Ekitike, who has impressed since moving to Anfield.",
      "“I wouldn't play Isak, he hasn't looked ready since coming from Newcastle,” the former England and Manchester United forward said on The Wayne Rooney Show. “He hasn't trained, hasn't had a pre-season. It's so important. While Newcastle were training he was probably sat at home on the phone to his agent for six hours a day trying to get a move.",
      "“It's so difficult when you don't have a pre-season. He might've done stuff by himself but he's paying the price of it.",
      "“On performances, he doesn't deserve to be playing ahead of Ekitike.”",
      "While Isak's latest display has been scrutinised, Wirtz has also been singled out by pundits; Emmanuel Petit claimed ahead of Sunday's big game against United that the Germany playmaker is not worth the £116m that Liverpool paid back in the summer.",
      "Isak at least has the benefit of being a proven Premier League player but Wirtz is a different entity and Jamie Carragher conceded that question marks over the former Leverkusen star are likely to continue, with some maybe even wondering if signing him was a mistake if he is unable to hit top form before the early months of 2026.",
      "“But, if I’m being honest, if I think of the great foreign signings - Sami Hyppia, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Luis Suarez, Didi Hamann - they all hit the ground running.",
      "“I can’t think of many, who had an average, poor start - I’m not talking seven games by the way but if you’re getting to Christmas and January and being like ‘oh’. History doesn’t tell me that foreign signings coming into England take a year.”",
      "He continued: “Seven or eight games is too early [to judge] but once we get to January, February, March when is the time we can start saying ‘maybe this was a mistake?’",
      "“Especially at Liverpool, players who are great foreign signings for the club hit the ground running.”",

      "The son of England football legend Stuart Pearce has been killed in a tractor crash at the age of 21. Harley Pearce died last Thursday after losing control of the farm vehicle on a country road near his family home in Wiltshire.",
      "It is thought that the tractor sustained a possible tyre blow-out which caused him to veer off the road. Gloucestershire Police confirmed a man in his 20s died at the scene in Witcombe.",
      "Harley was the youngest of Pearce’s two children with his ex-wife, Liz. They also share an older daughter, Chelsea, from their 20-year marriage, which ended in 2013.",
      "Harley didn't follow his father into football and instead ran his own company, Harley Pearce Agricultural Service, and worked on farms across the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire border. He lived near Marlborough in Wiltshire.",
      "However, he also appeared to be a football fan, with Stuart, who enjoyed a long football career playing for the likes of Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Manchester City, once sharing a touching story about how he helped Harley win his school’s Fantasy Football League when he was just eight years old.",
      "During his tenure as the England U21s head coach between 2007 and 2013, Stuart once rang former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson to ask whether he was planning to play Phil Jones or Chris Smalling, under the guise that he wanted the information for his England team.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Pearce explained how his son was just one point behind his school headmaster in the popular game with only one game left to play of the season.",
      "After Ferguson gave him the answer, Pearce's son signed that player for his Fantasy Football side (he could not recall whether it was Jones or Smalling), and the subsequent clean sheet points United earned during the game saw him win the league.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Pearce said: \"I done Fantasy Football with my son Harley, he was eight years old at the time, and they done it at the school with all the kids and all the teachers.",
      "\"We worked our way up the league to that final week where it was my son Harley and the headmaster were neck and neck at the top of the table.",
      "\"I think we were one point behind. I picked the phone up to Alex Ferguson on the Wednesday before this game on the Saturday and I asked him the question under the guise of the England under-21 manager 'who are you going to be playing - Jones or Smalling in the back, because I'm thinking of coming to the game to watch them?'",
      "\"He told me which one he was going to play. I transferred a player, that player went into our Fantasy team and we won.\"",
      "Pearce added: \"All I can say in my defence is Campione, campione!\"",
      "Following the announcement of Harley's death, a family tribute read: \"Our family is truly shocked and utterly heartbroken at the loss of our cherished son and devoted brother, Harley. A soul who left an unforgettable imprint on all who knew him.",
      "\"He was a golden boy with an infectious smile, and this shocking tragedy will leave a huge hole in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to have known him.",
      "\"With a quiet, understated strength and deep kindness, we are so proud of the young man he had become, exhibiting a wonderful work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit in the farming industry.",
      "\"He will always be our shining star. Rest in Peace, our beautiful son and brother. You will never ever be forgotten.\"",
      "Emergency services were called at around 2.30pm on Thursday to a report of a collision involving a tractor on the A417, Old Birdlip Hill in Witcombe. A source told the Daily Mail: \"From what we've been told is Harley's tractor had a blow out and he lost control.\"",

      "United have picked up some big wins under Amorim, including at Manchester City last season and away at Liverpool on Sunday. However, they remain in mid-table and suffered a shock early Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby.",
      "Even before the latest victory, though, Jones was making the case for United still leading the way in the 'big club stakes. \"People say... United's not the biggest club any more - it is,\" he told Stadium Astro pitchside at United's September win over Chelsea.",
      "\"It is, unfortunately and you don't realise that, and people think 'How?' and 'Look where you are' and no, it doesn't work like that,\" he added.",

      "United boss Amorim found himself under significant pressure after a return of just seven points from the first six games of the season. Things have improved since, though, with wins against Sunderland and Liverpool in back-to-back games.",
      "It's the first time the club have won two in a row in the league since the end of the 2023/24 season. Harry Maguire was the match-winner on this occasion, delivering a crucial late goal after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's early opener.",
      "\"It is really important for me that is back-to-back, it doesn't matter about the opponent it is just the feeling of winning. The important thing is to think three in the row and that's the focus,\" Amorim told BBC Sport after the latest win.",
      "\"Sometimes we struggle to choose the right time to press. We didn't start well after the equaliser but we controlled the momentum and pushing them to their half when they had the ball is important and that is where we won the game.\"",
      "With United having no European responsibilities this season, their very next game will provide an opportunity to earn three league wins on the spin for the first time since February 2024. They're back at Old Trafford, with Brighton the visitors - nine months on for a Seagulls win which prompted Amorim to claim his United squad might have been the worst in the club's history",

      "Carlos Baleba says he's returned to top form ahead of Brighton's showdown with Manchester United. The 21-year-old midfielder, who was linked with a move to Old Trafford in the summer, will be eager to show Ruben Amorim exactly what he can do when they meet this weekend.",
      "Baleba commemorated the Seagulls' victory over Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon with an Instagram post. Captioning a collection of images from the Amex Stadium, the Cameroon international wrote: \"Good team win and I'm feeling like myself again. #areyouabaleba.\"",
      "United players Leny Yoro and Andre Onana featured among the thousands of users who 'liked' the post. Baleba endured a rocky beginning to the campaign, with Fabian Hurzeler openly demanding he raise his game, but he impressed at the weekend.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of the Magpies fixture, the Brighton manager challenged him to 'step up and show personality'. Hurzeler said: \"I think we're getting to a time now where it's up to him, where he has to take responsibility as well.",
      "\"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton. No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.",
      "\"Now he has to make a step up and show personality, that's his next step in his personal development for sure. Like I said in the last weeks, there are waves in development, but you can only get out of it if you take ownership and if you take responsibility, there are some moments where nobody can help you.",
      "\"You have to be your own support, your own help. He has the best environment here he can get, he has great teammates who are there for him and support him.",
      "\"But now it's also up to the player that he steps up, that he shows personality and takes ownership of his development. That's what I demand from him in the future.\"",
      "Tony Bloom recently spoke about Baleba's future, confirming that United had indeed shown interest in securing a deal. Speaking to The Argus, the Seagulls' owner said: \"I don't think Baleba was a saga.",
      "\"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.",
      "\"But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "United didn't see bolstering their midfield as a pressing need, hence the signing of three high-profile forwards in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Baleba stayed put at the Amex Stadium, but it seems the Red Devils are ready to make another attempt to secure his signature.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has lifted the lid on Manchester United's tactical plan against Liverpool as they deliberately targeted two players during their 2-1 victory over the Reds on Sunday. Harry Maguire netted a late winner for the Red Devils, inflicting a fourth consecutive loss on Arne Slot's side and first home defeat to their fierce rivals since 2016.",
      "United got off to a flying start with Bryan Mbeumo finding the back of the net early on, slipping the ball past Giorgi Mamardashvili after play continued despite a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "Liverpool managed to claw back an equaliser in the 78th minute thanks to Cody Gakpo, but their joy was short-lived as Maguire headed home a Bruno Fernandes' cross just six minutes later, piling more misery on the Reds.",
      "Despite creating numerous opportunities, Liverpool were left ruing missed chances, with Gakpo hitting the woodwork thrice. The Dutchman and Mohamed Salah also both squandered golden opportunities, while Alexander Isak was thwarted by Senne Lammens in a one-on-one situation.",
      "However, it was their defensive frailties that proved costly once again, as they conceded twice for the seventh time in just 12 matches across all competitions this season, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "Summer recruit Milos Kerkez had a tough time at left-back, having to deal with the threat of Amad Diallo, as well as both Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha at different points in the match.",
      "De Ligt confessed that United had intentionally exploited the Hungarian, along with right-back Conor Bradley, identifying Liverpool's full-back positions as a 'weakness'.",
      "\"We knew that Liverpool had weaknesses, and that's their full-backs,\" he admitted to ViaPlay. \"We were all really hyped, and the focus was very high. Today was a game that you really have to be concentrated in.\"",
      "Kerkez played the entire 90 minutes at left-back against United, whilst Bradley was substituted after 62 minutes for Florian Wirtz, with the German's arrival forcing Dominik Szoboszlai to shift to right-back.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong was subsequently brought on to replace Mohamed Salah as a right-winger, with United's decisive goal originating from Liverpool's right flank after their opening strike had come from being played through down the left side of the Reds' backline.",
      "Kerkez faced harsh scrutiny following the defeat as former Liverpool captain Jamie Redknapp branded the left-back a 'nervous wreck'.",
      "\"The game is happening a bit too fast and Diallo is causing him problems. With Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha they've gone for a different approach with a bit more pace.\"",
      "Meanwhile, ex-Reds defender Stephen Warnock also criticised Kerkez's display as he raised concerns about his partnership with Virgil van Dijk on the left side of Liverpool's defence.",
      "\"Kerkez and Van Dijk's relationship on this left-hand side is not working,\" he commented on BBC Radio 5 Live.",
      "\"There is a lack of communication and the ball is getting slipped down the side far too many times.",
      "\"Again they are far too easy to get at. Far too vulnerable to the turnover of possession.\"",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher also expressed his confusion over the Reds' defensive issues on Kerkez's side.",
      "\"The United system is causing Liverpool all sorts of problems. Kerkez doesn't look comfortable.\"",

      "Given his role as co-commentator, fans on social media voiced their displeasure with Neville's reaction with one X user writing: \"I get it but this is so unprofessional from Gary Neville loool.\"",
      "It was an opinion shared by many online with another user taking aim at Neville's objectivity by commenting: \"Gary Neville turned from pundit to full-time United ultra in 0.5 seconds. Man forgot he’s live on Sky, not in the away end.\"",
      "The ex-England man has had to contend with accusations of being unprofessional in his commentary role and even admitted to doing so during United's 4-0 defeat to Liverpool in April 2022.",
      "Neville's praise of Hannibal Mejbri led to widespread criticism after the now-Burnley midfielder committed two aggressive fouls within minutes of coming on in the 84th minute.",

      "\"That is why I aired on to the slightly unprofessional side of commentary tonight,\" Neville said. \"When I said that the kid [Mejbri] to be fair I was proud of him because he was going round trying to top people and trying to kick people.",

      "David Beckham has been approached to front a takeover bid for Manchester United. Beckham spent over a decade at Old Trafford, making almost 400 appearances.",
      "Rumours swirled this month that United could be set for some investment or a takeover. Turki Al-Sheikh first claimed that talks had begun with a prospective bidder and later clarified that it was not Saudi Arabia who were interested.",
      "Now, an unknown consortium from the UAE is preparing an offer for the Glazer family's majority shares, and they want Beckham to be an ambassador for the bid, rather than back it with his mammoth net worth.",
      "Beckham has amassed a considerable fortune from his days on the field and his exploits off of it. He currently owns stakes in both Inter Miami and Salford City.",
      "The Englishman's net worth currently stands at a reported £300million. Beckham retired in 2013 whilst playing for PSG and by the time he called it quits, Business Insider claims he had earned a staggering £580m.",
      "He was the highest-paid player globally at one stage and the groundbreaking five-year contract he signed with LA Galaxy in 2008 would be worth around £190m in total these days.",
      "But the 50-year-old added to this fortune through various endorsements and brand deals. Beckham has worked with the likes of Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and Adidas.",
      "Beckham has also put his name to various products over the years, including his own fragrance line, video games and some signature sunglasses.",
      "An eponymous Netflix documentary that aired in 2023 reportedly earned him roughly £20m and in that year alone he raked in just over £72m from various products and brand deals.",
      "Beckham also signed a 10-year contract to serve as an ambassador for Qatar, reportedly earning around £125m in total from the country. Besides generating enormous income from his various ventures, Beckham is known for his lavish spending.",
      "He has a portfolio of over a dozen properties valued at approximately £70m. This includes a luxury penthouse in Miami purchased for £17.5m and a London townhouse estimated at about £30m.",
      "His wife, Victoria, famed for being a member of the Spice Girls, has a net worth of £200m. If combined, the power couple has an accumulative fortune of over £500m. Though none of this will go into the consortium's potential bid.",

      "Ruben Amorim hit back at Jamie Carragher's forecast that he'd be sacked from his Manchester United role before Christmas after securing a crucial triumph over Liverpool. The United manager secured his first Premier League away victory in seven months as his team emerged 2-1 victors at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "United claimed their first triumph at the reigning champions' fortress since 2016 courtesy of strikes from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire. Beyond handing Liverpool a brutal loss, Arne Slot's outfit have now suffered four consecutive defeats across all competitions for the first time since 2014.",
      "While Amorim achieved successive league victories for the first time since assuming control nearly 12 months ago. During his post-match media briefing, Amorim specifically mentioned predictions that he would be dismissed by Christmas - an opinion put forward by Carragher earlier this month.",
      "The Portuguese tactician declared: \"It is really important. I don't have many wins in Manchester. It is really important back to back, every detail of this game, the spirit when we suffer a bad moment or control, all the small things was perfect.",
      "\"Let's try to do that next week. It is really important for our fans, they struggle against Grimsby and Brentford and today they saw a different team.",
      "\"I think it is not normal, it is hard to find something like this, so many bad moments and to have the fans always supporting the manager when every one of you (the media) is saying he is gone before Christmas.\"",
      "Despite United's 2-0 triumph over Sunderland before the international break, it didn't prevent Carragher from predicting that Amorim will be given his marching orders within the next two months.",
      "\"It's inevitable that this is going to happen before Christmas. His stats are unbelievable for a Manchester United manager. Fifty games as Manchester United manager, he's only scored two more goals than he's conceded.\"",
      "Amorim didn't downplay the significance of the Anfield victory but was quick to shift attention to their upcoming home match against a high-flying Brighton side this weekend.",
      "\"We fought for every ball, we lost our composure in the second half but the spirit was there and that is the most important thing, if you have the spirit you can win any game. It was a good day and now I am concerned about Brighton. I will enjoy it but let's focus on Brighton.\"",

      "Senne Lammens confessed Manchester United's triumph over Liverpool was the most significant match of his career.",
      "Lammens secured a clean sheet against Sunderland prior to the international break, but featuring against Liverpool at Anfield was certain to pose different challenges for the keeper. And the 23 year old rose to the occasion.",
      "Lammens wasn't fazed by the Anfield atmosphere and delivered a pivotal performance in a memorable triumph, producing several vital stops and easing the pressure with his distribution.",
      "\"I think it was like ten seasons ago we won here [in 2016], so you can feel it as well with the fans. This atmosphere was one of the biggest games I was looking forward to when I came here, so I'm so happy we could win today.\"",
      "Lammens was questioned whether it represented the most important fixture of his career. \"Yeah, it has to be, I'm not even close, I think,\" he said, before outlining how his preparation remained largely unchanged from any other encounter.",
      "\"I think you just try to be like yourself, don't really overthink it, it's just a game, to be honest, at the end of the day. Just in my preparation, the same as usual. I concentrate on the pitch.",
      "\"Not really looking or hearing what's going on outside of the pitch, and I think with this team today, how we fought, it feels so good that we got what we deserved, I think. So it's really good today.\"",
      "Mason Mount heaped praise on Lammens for easing the pressure with his lengthy clearances following the Sunderland triumph, and the tactic proved incredibly successful against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"We know how they press, they're gonna go man-vs-man, so I think being realistic, coming into Anfield, it's quite difficult to build up, I think, so from the beginning on with the defenders, I think I made the decision that we should get more of a long ball and do it with the second ball,\" Lammens said.",
      "\"Even though we didn't really have a target striker. But I think even though we didn't have one, the second ball we did quite good, so that's how we could still push them away, and how we also scored the first one, I think, it was because of the long ball, second ball and then a counter.\"",
      "When questioned whether that was his own choice, he responded: \"No, it's also the team, the coach, they try to give you as much information as they can, but yeah, you have to be realistic as well, especially in the beginning of the game, if it really works like this, then you should just stay with this tactic, and I think today it worked out.\"",
      "Lammens went on: \"Like I said, it was ten seasons ago since we win in here, so that's kind of special, and also, I don't know for sure, but two [league wins] in a row is also something we've been looking forward to, to get the momentum going.",
      "\"I think that was a big part of what the coach showed us this season, get the momentum going, and there's been quite some disappointments this season, some games that we wanted to take momentum but we couldn't, and I think today could be a start of a good momentum, and we should next week at home as well (against Brighton), so with the fans behind us we should try to win that game as well.\"",
      "United displayed tremendous spirit to net a decisive goal following Cody Gakpo's leveller.",
      "\"Yeah, I've not been here a long time, but you can feel it. With the team, we've all got players who are really experienced, and we know that even if they score we've still got a chance,\" he said.",
      "\"I think last year as well and this season we scored some goals after the opponent scored, so we knew with the crosses on Harry [Maguire] and stuff, he scored quite a lot of them.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"So you never want a game like this, but especially defending in the last 20 minutes, defending the box and how we throw ourselves in front of the ball, also the players who came in, it's not difficult in this environment, and the type of game it was, so I'm really proud of the team today.\"",
      "When asked about blocking out external pressures, he replied: \"Yeah, I try my hardest, I think I'm quite OK at this, trying to keep the noise out from outside, like I said, just prepare the same way as I've always done, treat it like any other game, of course you have to be realistic, it's not like any other game.",
      "\"But you still try to prepare like this, and I think just from the first minute on you be realistic, and like I said with the game plan we did as well, I think we executed it quite good, so we knew before the game it was going to be really difficult, and we had to defend with 11 people, and we did, so it was really good.\"",
      "Speaking about Ruben Amorim, Lammens stated: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Lammens' life has taken a dramatic turn since his move to Old Trafford. \"Of course from the outside I try to keep my best friends close, my family and the rest is a little bit like outside noise, now I'm doing good. So it's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it goes not so good it will be all bad commentary,\" he expressed.",
      "\"I think my social media has exploded, but they told me before the transfer, I already knew it a little bit, but it's just a really good feeling that you get the praise, also with the wins, it's a really nice feeling.",
      "\"It's [Manchester] really nice, I've been in my apartment now a couple of weeks, so it's quite easy.\"",
      "Will Lammens celebrate the victory?",
      "\"I think I'm going to go quite easy tonight,\" he smiled. \"One of my best mates is here, so I'm going to spend the evening with him a little bit, enjoy this.",
      "\"But I think we've tasted it and now we want more, that's the most important, so this is not the end station, so now we just have to keep going.\"",

      "We knew we had to win our duels. In the first 10 to 15 minutes, we knew they would try to start the game very strong.",
      "During the first half, we knew they were under pressure when they had time on the ball. Their fans were putting themselves in a difficult position because they were booing a little for them to play a bit quicker. That's how Liverpool likes to play.",
      "Manchester United could financially benefit again from the sale of Mason Greenwood - more than a year after he left the club.",
      "The forward joined Marseille in the summer of 2024 with United receiving a fee rising to £26.6 million. As part of the deal, United added in 50% a sell-on clause.",
      "Should Greenwood move on from Marseille any time, it means that United could be due a sizeable sum of money. The player was linked with a move away in the summer transfer window with clubs in Saudi Arabia interested, but he remained with the French side.",
      "Barcelona are now the latest club said to be keeping an eye on the player. TBR Football report that scouts were in attendance to watch Greenwood in Marseille’s 6-2 win over Le Havre on Saturday.",
      "Greenwood would have impressed those watching on, scoring no fewer four of his team’s six goals. The scouting trip comes as Barcelona assess their forward options ahead of next summer.",
      "Dermot Gallagher has backed referee Michael Oliver's decision not to halt play ahead of Manchester United's opening goal against Liverpool at Anfield. The incident occurred just before Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock.",
      "Bruno Fernandes intercepted a lax header from Virgil van Dijk, who collided with Alexis Mac Allister while jumping to win a header. The Liverpool midfielder fell to the ground in a heap, but Michael Oliver allowed play to continue.",
      "Gallagher said:",
      "Is there a foul? No, because it's Van Dijk who comes in behind Mac Allister. Michael Oliver assesses it and says 'no foul' and play goes on very quickly.",
      "He's forced to break with and so is the assistant, so neither see Mac Allister behind them. Within five seconds, the ball is in the net. The first time they see Mac Allister down, the ball is in the net so they can go back. It's just an unfortunate incident.",
      "Harry Maguire's winning goal for Manchester United against Liverpool came a few days after Paul Scholes said he was \"not athletic enough.\" Maguire, 32, rose above the Merseysiders' backline and directed Bruno Fernandes' lofted volley back across Giorgi Mamardashvili and into the far corner.",
      "In the build-up to United's trip to Anfield, Scholes said Maguire, Luke Shaw and Casemiro are no longer physically up for the task and below Premier League level.",
      "However, Amorim clearly doesn't see it that way, with Shaw, Casemiro and Maguire all starting against Arne Slot's side. Maguire was the only one out of the trio to play the full 90 minutes, with Casemiro making way for Manuel Ugarte and Shaw coming off for Leny Yoro.",
      "Eric Cantona has been mentioned in the latest Manchester United takeover claim following fresh investment talk from the Middle East. The Glazer family recently opened the door to outside funding with Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquiring a minority stake in the club last year.",
      "Even though he only recently made an investment, takeover rumours were sparked over the international break when Saudi official Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for United. He was later forced to clarify that he was not the potential investor, with talkSPORT stating the belief was they are UAE-based.",
      "Their report added that some United legends had been approached over being involved in any potential bid, with some clarity on exactly that and specifically one name that was approached, being revealed.",
      "According to The Guardian, Cantona has held talks over potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him back a prospective consortium in a bid for United. Other former players have also been contacted.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee showed his true colours following Manchester United's 2-1 win over Liverpool. The 24-year-old striker, who has recently been linked with a move away, was one of the first players to celebrate the victory at Anfield on Sunday evening.",
      "Despite being an unused substitute, Zirkzee squashed suggestions that he's unhappy when he darted onto the pitch at full-time. As the Netherlands international approached his teammates, Bruno Fernandes jokingly tried to put him in a headlock before bumping chests with Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "One fan wrote on X wrote: \"Love the guy. I feel bad that he's not playing more but that's the situation we're in. Hopefully we can string together a few wins/momentum and he'll be able to get more minutes. He's a joy to watch.\"",
      "Harry Maguire savoured scoring against Liverpool during what could be his final visit to Anfield for Manchester United.",
      "Maguire has entered the final year of his contract, and he admitted scoring was sweetened by securing a victory on what could potentially be his last Anfield visit with United.",
      "He said:",
      "I've been here seven years now, so it's been tough for the seven years not getting that win",
      "It's been on my mind a little bit, to be honest. I'm in my last year now, so this could be the last time I played at Anfield for this club, so it's really important that I've come here and tick that one off because it has been playing on mind.",
      "Manchester United's pursuit of Morten Hjulmand rests on Ruben Amorim's future as manager, according to reports.",
      "Journalist Gianluca Di Marzio says Amorim 'loves' the midfielder and United will only move for him if the Portuguese remains in charge.",
      "Amorim signed Hjulmand, 26, for Sporting CP from Lecce in 2023.",
      "Roy Keane has shut down suggestions that Manchester United might be back after Sunday's huge 2-1 win at Liverpool.",
      "Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire - either side of a Cody Gakpo equaliser - saw United earn their first victory at Anfield since January 2016 under Louis van Gaal. The three points was also the first time United had earned back-to-back wins under Ruben Amorim in the Premier League after beating Sunderland before the international break.",
      "The Reds will now be hoping that their first win at their fierce rivals in almost a decade can lead to a revival under Amorim, with the Portuguese coming under huge pressure this season. Sunday's win has moved them up to ninth in the table - just two points off fourth-placed Liverpool.",
      "But former Reds midfielder Keane has urged caution over any notion that his old side may now be back. United host Brighton & Hove Albion next, who have a good record at Old Trafford.",

      "It's not easy to play here, but all of them have an opportunity to play for us and then they leave and life is like that. Harry Maguire is really important for us and was today. He is a great example, everything he has been through, a great example of every kid.",

      "Senne Lammens admitted Manchester United's win against Liverpool was the biggest game of his career.",
      "Lammens kept a clean sheet against Sunderland before the international break, but starting against Liverpool at Anfield was bound to ask different questions of the goalkeeper. And the 23-year-old had the answers.",
      "Lammens was not intimated by the Anfield atmosphere and played a crucial role in a special victory, making some important saves and releasing pressure with his goal kicks.",
      "\"I think it was like ten seasons ago we won here [in 2016], so you can feel it as well with the fans. This atmosphere was one of the biggest games I was looking forward to when I came here, so I'm so happy we could win today.\"",
      "Lammens was asked whether it was the biggest came of his career. \"Yeah, it has to be, I'm not even close, I think,\" he said, before explaining his approach was more or less the same as every other game.",
      "\"I think you just try to be like yourself, don't really overthink it, it's just a game, to be honest, at the end of the day. Just in my preparation, the same as usual. I concentrate on the pitch.",
      "\"Not really looking or hearing what's going on outside of the pitch, and I think with this team today, how we fought, it feels so good that we got what we deserved, I think. So it's really good today.\"",
      "Mason Mount praised Lammens for releasing pressure with his long kicks after the Sunderland win, and the approach was hugely effective against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"We know how they press, they're gonna go man-vs-man, so I think being realistic, coming into Anfield, it's quite difficult to build up, I think, so from the beginning on with the defenders, I think I made the decision that we should get more of a long ball and do it with the second ball,\" Lammens said.",
      "\"Even though we didn't really have a target striker. But I think even though we didn't have one, the second ball we did quite good, so that's how we could still push them away, and how we also scored the first one, I think, it was because of the long ball, second ball and then a counter.\"",
      "When asked if that was his own decision, he said: \"No, it's also the team, the coach, they try to give you as much information as they can, but yeah, you have to be realistic as well, especially in the beginning of the game, if it really works like this, then you should just stay with this tactic, and I think today it worked out.\"",
      "Lammens continued: \"Like I said, it was ten seasons ago since we win in here, so that's kind of special, and also, I don't know for sure, but two [league wins] in a row is also something we've been looking forward to, to get the momentum going.",
      "\"I think that was a big part of what the coach showed us this season, get the momentum going, and there's been quite some disappointments this season, some games that we wanted to take momentum but we couldn't, and I think today could be a start of a good momentum, and we should next week at home as well (against Brighton), so with the fans behind us we should try to win that game as well.\"",
      "United showed immense character to score a winner after an equaliser from Cody Gakpo. \"Yeah, I've not been here a long time, but you can feel it. With the team, we've all got players who are really experienced, and we know that even if they score we've still got a chance,\" he said.",
      "\"I think last year as well and this season we scored some goals after the opponent scored, so we knew with the crosses on Harry [Maguire] and stuff, he scored quite a lot of them.",
      "\"So you never want a game like this, but especially defending in the last 20 minutes, defending the box and how we throw ourselves in front of the ball, also the players who came in, it's not difficult in this environment, and the type of game it was, so I'm really proud of the team today.\"",
      "Asked about shutting out the noise, he responded: \"Yeah, I try my hardest, I think I'm quite OK at this, trying to keep the noise out from outside, like I said, just prepare the same way as I've always done, treat it like any other game, of course you have to be realistic, it's not like any other game.",
      "\"But you still try to prepare like this, and I think just from the first minute on you be realistic, and like I said with the game plan we did as well, I think we executed it quite good, so we knew before the game it was going to be really difficult, and we had to defend with 11 people, and we did, so it was really good.\"",
      "Discussing Ruben Amorim, Lammens said: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Lammens' life has changed dramatically since moving to Old Trafford. \"Of course from the outside I try to keep my best friends close, my family and the rest is a little bit like outside noise, now I'm doing good. So it's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it goes not so good it will be all bad commentary,\" he said.",
      "\"I think my social media has exploded, but they told me before the transfer, I already knew it a little bit, but it's just a really good feeling that you get the praise, also with the wins, it's a really nice feeling.",
      "\"It's [Manchester] really nice, I've been in my apartment now a couple of weeks, so it's quite easy.\"",
      "Will Lammens celebrate the victory? \"I think I'm going to go quite easy tonight,\" he smiled. \"One of my best mates is here, so I'm going to spend the evening with him a little bit, enjoy this.",
      "\"But I think we've tasted it and now we want more, that's the most important, so this is not the end station, so now we just have to keep going.\"",

      "\"What have you got for us, then?\" someone jokingly said to Liverpool legend John Barnes as he left Anfield.",
      "Despite Manchester United's victory, Barnes was in good form and laughed as he stuck up his middle finger to journalists. The chuckles from the media would have been heard from the dressing room.",
      "\"There are not a lot of feelings in the world like this, I think,\" he said. \"Playing in front of the fans two weeks ago was a dream come true, with the clean sheet and the win, but today is a different kind of day.\"",
      "Omar Berrada (United CEO) and Jason Wilcox (director of football) clasped hands with a United staff member. Berrada was asked what he made of the 2-1 victory and responded: \"Happy!\"",
      "Wilcox said he was \"very happy\". Both United chiefs had huge smiles on their faces, a contrast to the expression on Virgil van Dijk's face when he came out to front up to the Liverpool pack.",
      "“It’s been a while… not in my time we’ve been losing four in a row,\" said Van Dijk. “We’ve been through difficult times in different circumstances and it is always a challenge, but it is one we have to deal with.\"",
      "Van Dijk was interrupted by Joshua Zirkzee as the forward emerged from the dressing room and the pair exchanged a few words.",
      "Zirkzee also embraced fellow countryman Tijjani Reijnders in the mixed zone after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City.",
      "Luke Shaw would have found his car keys, wallet and Alexander Isak on his kitchen table at home when he emptied his pockets on Sunday evening. Isak walked through the mixed zone with his hood up.",
      "Liverpool forward Hugo Ekitike walked through next with an entourage the size of a small army.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha walked side-by-side, laughing and sharing jokes as they left for the United team bus. Cunha has not scored since joining from Wolves, but his impact has been huge.",
      "Diogo Dalot spoke to Manchester-based correspondents: \"You can imagine the feeling inside the dressing room, it took me eight years to win at Anfield.",
      "\"So obviously really proud of everyone involved, the players, the staff, everybody on the bench. Great feeling, a beautiful day for us and the fans. Everybody has to enjoy today.\"",
      "Harry Maguire couldn't wipe the smile from his face as he spoke. \"Yeah, the battery's going,\" he smiled about the messages on his phone.",
      "\"Amazing moment. I've had some great, great times at this club and some big winners. Obviously, Lyon and then to get the winner at Anfield, it's a great moment for me, a great moment for my family, and yeah, one I'm really proud of because it has been tough coming here.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot could feel \"positive energy\" in Manchester United training in the days leading up to the Liverpool game.",
      "Ruben Amorim became the first United manager since Louis van Gaal to win at Anfield, and the victory meant he claimed back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time.",
      "Amorim granted additional time off for the players who had been travelling for international duty or trained throughout the break, meaning United had just a few days to prepare with a full squad to face Liverpool.",
      "That didn't prevent United from securing the biggest win of Amorim's tenure at Anfield.",
      "\"To be honest, it's hard, especially when you come from the national team to prepare for a game like this,\" said Dalot after the game. \"You have the full squad for two or three days, no more than that, but the lads who stayed... and the last few days we had were really good.",
      "\"Even the players who were not going to start, you could feel the energy and the positive energy they were giving to those who were going to start, because at any moment they can be important.",
      "\"You saw the substitutes, they came on and they had to help us defend the game and go after the result again. I'm really proud of everyone, the boys and everyone involved.\"",

Great feeling, a beautiful day for us and the fans. Everybody has to enjoy today.\"",
      "When asked if it was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",

We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",
      "Dalot added: \"It's part of our job [to deal with outside noise], I've been here long enough to understand everyone will have opinions, everyone will have something to say about Man United.",

      "\"But it's the way you show it, the way you work every day, sometimes, especially this season, we've been doing really good in training at Carrington, but then the results are not coming on.",
      "\"But that's what everybody sees. They don't see what you do every day. So ultimately, they will judge what you do on the pitch on the weekend, and we have to win games, that has to be the mindset.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo drew first blood when he opened the scoring within two minutes. Liverpool pushed hard to score an equaliser and finally found a breakthrough thanks to Cody Gakpo in the 78th minute.",

      "Manchester United supporters have had too many disappointing journeys home on the M62 in the last decade but not on Sunday night.",
      "The Reds were good value for their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. Bryan Mbeumo set the tone early as he fired home thanks to an excellent Amad through ball. Cody Gakpo hit the post twice in the first half and again in the second before his luck eventually turned. He scored from close range to level proceedings and the momentum looked to have turned.",
      "But up stepped Harry Maguire. He rose highest at the back stick to divert Bruno Fernandes' cross in and spark jubilant scenes in the away end.",

      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Maguire reaction speaks volumes",
      "The long-lasting image in the minds of United fans after that victory will be of Maguire with his arms aloft being adored by the travelling contingent. However, a more important image was the centre-back repeatedly thumping the badge after the game.",
      "For too long United have been accused of having some players in their ranks who don't show the commitment expected of the fans. Maguire isn't one of those players and the Reds should ensure that a new contract is prepared for him.",
      "Slot confusion",
      "With the benefit of hindsight, Ruben Amorim mastered Arne Slot before a ball was even kicked. There were a couple of positions up for grabs heading into the game but few thought that Benjamin Sesko would be dropped.",
      "The decision even caught Slot by surprise as shown in his pre-match interview. He was left guessing when asked how United would line up in the forward area and that confusion paid dividends inside two minutes as the Reds scored on their first attack.",
      "Schmeichel transfers his powers",
      "As United's players exited the team bus at Anfield, Senne Lammens was greeted by Peter Schmeichel who gave the Belgian a big hug.",
      "Lammens oozed confidence between the sticks and he was not worn down by the intimidating atmosphere at Anfield. Amorim said the goalkeeper was not Schmeichel yet but the away end reinvigorated that chant again in the first half when he stood up to Alexander Isak and made a huge save.",
      "Two legends",
      "It was a blood-and-thunder atmosphere at Anfield and there was no love lost on the pitch. But in the stands, two club legends managed to move rivalries to one side to enjoy some Chocolate Buttons.",

      "\"I want you guys to continue with the narrative that you are so I will not increase the goal,\" said Ruben Amorim following Manchester United's win against Liverpool.",
      "\"What we need to do is try to win three games in a row and then forget about top four top six we already said we want to go to Europe. This doesn’t change nothing, we are the same team we were 90 minutes ago.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether United are \"through the storm\" and said: \"I have no idea. If we show the spirit we show every day I think we are going to win so many games, but for that we need to show action.\"",
      "It certainly feels like the clouds above Old Trafford have lifted after a superb win against the Premier League champions in their back yard, but Liverpool must be the turning point.",
      "United are just two points adrift of the top four and suddenly the outcry after Brentford looks like an overreaction. Amorim might be able to turn the Reds around after a rollercoaster start to the season.",
      "United have refused to do anything the easy way throughout Amorim's tenure, so it felt appropriate that he claimed successive wins in the Premier League for the first time against Liverpool.",
      "The Liverpool game was a resounding success for Amorim for different reasons. He claimed successive league victories, made decisive team selection decisions and won the tactical battle against Arne Slot.",
      "The decision to revert to a striker-less attacking line was brave and it paid off in spades. Amorim placed his faith in Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha and the trio rewarded his judgement.",
      "Nobody would have blamed Amorim for naming Amad on the bench in favour of picking more defensive minded wing-backs on both sides, but the 23-year-old was unplayable at times in the first half.",
      "There had been teething problems with Mbeumo and Amad down the right but the pieces beautifully came together at Anfield.",
      "The pair combined like a double act on the West End in London. They linked up ruthlessly to open the scoring within two minutes and continued to dance down the right side.",
      "The decision to recall Harry Maguire at the expense of Leny Yoro was a genuine masterstroke, with Maguire rising highest in the 84th minute to score a brilliantly headed matchwinner.",
      "Amorim explained that Maguire was starting because of his \"experience\" in big games and his ability to deal with crosses. He must have forgotten the 32-year-old has a goal or two in his armoury.",
      "Casemiro performed like a wily old fox and it was a big decision to start him, considering he played 90 minutes twice for Brazil in South Korea and Japan during a lengthy international break trek.",
      "United's boss said he picked his team based on his \"gut\" - he should listen to his instincts more often.",
      "Amorim must use the Liverpool win as a springboard to further success. It cannot be a false dawn, a dreaded two words which have been trotted out under various different United managers down the years.",
      "United have no European football this season, something that can be spun as a positive or a problem.",
      "\"It's difficult sometimes when you only have one game a week because there's a lot of time to think,\" Mount admitted after the victory against Sunderland before the break.",
      "\"After a game like Brentford, we're hurt. As a team, as a staff, because we know we can do better. It really hurts us, obviously, as a club as well. It feels like a long time until the next game.\"",
      "United will welcome Brighton to Old Trafford on Saturday and the evening kick-off slot should help the team make a fast start - the atmosphere tends to be better under floodlights.",
      "Nottingham Forest come next - they have sacked two managers this season - and a trip to Tottenham follows. United could be in the Champions League places by the time the November international break begins.",
      "That will only be possible if the Liverpool victory is not a false dawn.",

He is said to have informed his representatives that, unless there is a dramatic change over the coming weeks and months, he will have to leave during January.",

Sport have also named Real Sociedad and Valencia as the leading La Liga clubs with an interest while there are tentative links to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Alonso, however, addressed the potential of Endrick and Garcia leaving on loan in January after their 1-0 over Getafe on Sunday. \"I'm not thinking about it at the moment,\" he said, \"it's not on my mind. Both are ready to play. It's a position where competition is fierce.\"",

      "Cunha took his opportunity with both hands and has left the United boss with a major selection headache heading into the next match at home to Brighton. Speaking exclusively to MEN Sport as an ambassador for Escapist Magazine, Yorke insisted that the United coaching team need to be careful to avoid denting Sesko's confidence.",
      "\"One of the narratives for any coach is that you want to create a team that is competitive on all fronts,\" the current Trinidad and Tobago head coach explained. \"From front to back you want two players in every position competing so that way you keep the level high.",
      "\"Sesko for me is as good as a striker they have had for a number of years and I feel like you have to trust him and have to believe in him to get the best out of him. With any good player, you want a reaction from him when they have been... 'resting' is the word they tend to use now, not dropped, but you need a reaction from that.",

      "\"On this occasion it has worked, the manager will get the plaudits from that, but ultimately you have got to make sure that you manage those players equally so you don't end up losing a player that was meant to be your No.1 striker. Your No.1 striker wants to play in these massively important games and can understand when he has been left out, but not in a massively important game.",

      "Manchester United have made their fair share of transfer mistakes. Some transfer decisions were proven to be mistakes very quickly, while others have taken a little longer to be filed in the 'error' category; Danny Welbeck falls into the latter.",
      "Welbeck had scored 29 goals for United in 142 appearances for the club when he was sold, aged 23, for £16million. The striker's record at the Emirates Stadium was slightly better, bagging 32 goals in 126 appearances, but there was no sign that Welbeck would become as reliable in the Premier League as he has done.",
      "Moving to Brighton in 2020, the now 34-year-old has managed to reinvigorate his career.",
      "Welbeck seems to be getting better with age and has goals tally has been impressive despite him not starting every game for the Seagulls. Last season was Welbeck's best goalscoring Premier League campaign as he reached ten goals in 30 top flight appearances.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "But it is not just the goals that have been impressive, his performances for the team have shone through too. He is strong, a handful for defenders and is still managing to stretch the backline even though he is now one of the veterans in the division.",
      "On Saturday, Welbeck managed to steal the headlines once again as he scored twice in a 2-1 win over Newcastle at the Amex Stadium. He now has four in eight matches for Brighton and next in his sights is United.",
      "Since leaving the club, Welbeck has enjoyed his reunions with the Reds. On his first game back at Old Trafford in the 2015/16 season he scored in a 3-2 defeat and he bagged another against them in the following campaign, this time at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Since joining Brighton, Welbeck has managed three goals against United, including last season when the Seagulls won 2-1 at the Amex. The forward has shown since moving on from Old Trafford that he may never be a prolific scorer in the Premier League but he is always capable of chipping in and linking up play, and someone who could work perfectly in today's squad with Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Manchester United's surprise 2-1 victory over Liverpool has injected a new lease of life into their season when they needed it most.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side battled valiantly against the current Premier League champions to secure their first win at Anfield since January 2016 on Sunday. Despite all of the recent speculation about his potential sacking, Amorim's men made an impressive start as Bryan Mbeumo finished clinically to open the scoring inside two minutes.",
      "Both teams missed big chances before Cody Gakpo levelled the score with just over ten minutes remaining. Yet, it was United who delivered the final blow as Harry Maguire rose to head home Bruno Fernandes' cross and clinch all three points just minutes later.",
      "One of the key contributors to Amorim's first consecutive league victories was Senne Lammens, as we now turn our attention to two major headlines surrounding the in-form goalkeeper.",
      "The 23-year-old shot-stopper, who was signed from Royal Antwerp at the end of the summer transfer window for £18million, has stepped up to fill the shoes of the much-criticised and recently-departed Andre Onana. The win at Anfield marked just his second start for United, though Lammens admits he has already reaped the benefits of Amorim's managerial prowess.",
      "Speaking about his under-fire head coach, Lammens highlighted Amorim's ability to absorb all of the pressure off his players during difficult times, which has aided the Belgian in finding his form.",
      "Lammens said: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Despite being linked with more established names like Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa and Gianluigi Donnarumma, who eventually joined rivals Manchester City, Lammens was brought in by United during the summer. This was due to his younger age profile and relatively modest wages.",
      "However, Lammens had to bide his time in his first month with the English giants, having been left on the bench for September's three matches in favour of the shaky Altay Bayindir. That patience seems to have paid dividends, with club legend Rio Ferdinand impressed enough by Lammens' performance against Liverpool to speak highly of the youngster.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents after the game, the former defender said: \"He’s only played two games, I don’t want to get carried away, but in the two games he’s played, he’s been very dependable, and that’s the word you want with your goalkeeper.\"",
      "Ferdinand used five glowing words to describe the new United goalkeeper's key strengths. \"Safe, dependable, assured, assertive, calm,\" he said. \"These types of words are what you want with your goalkeeper. Long may that continue because that then instils confidence in the back line.\"",
      "Echoing the same sentiment, Sunday's match winner Maguire said post-match: \"I must say I am heavily impressed by Senne Lammens. I don't want to get carried away because he is playing in the position with the most pressure, it's the most difficult position at Manchester United. But he's got everything. Great personality.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo couldn't control his emotions when Harry Maguire scored a match-winning goal in Manchester United's win over Liverpool.",
      "It was a tense state of affairs at Anfield on Sunday, as Ruben Amorim's squad faced Arne Slot's Premier League champions in the north west derby. Bryan Mbeumo took the lead for United just two minutes into the fixture, slotting the ball through the legs of Giorgi Mamardashvili from close-range before wheeling off in celebration in front of the Kop.",
      "And while Cody Gakpo snuck in behind enemy lines 78 minutes into the fixture to make it 1-1, fate had other plans that prevented Liverpool from taking a point from the clash. That's because, six minutes later, Maguire sealed the deal for his club with a well-placed header at the back post and that ensured United claimed a hard-earned victory over their fiercest rivals.",
      "While the away crowd naturally erupted with jubilation, United's official social media account captured Amorim's animated reaction to the ball crossing the line. And, in the background, the clip also showed elation from Mainoo, who beamed with joy as he was hoisted up into the air by a member of the Reds' coaching staff.",
      "It came just moments before Mainoo entered the fray as a substitute for Bruno Fernandes, as Amorim looked to hold on to the lead that his side had earned. And that's exactly what United managed to do, repelling a thick and fast Liverpool onslaught which took place for the duration of the eight additional minutes for stoppage time.",
      "United now enjoy a week-long rest before they face Brighton at Old Trafford - with fixtures against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham away from home to play before the November international break. Speaking after the win, Amorim said: \"Every day is special, but of course, this was a very special win.",
      "\"To see our fans singing during the game, in one moment, the biggest rival, they are champions on their field, in their stadium. This win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team, because I believe that we can play so much better.",

      "Regarding the team news, Noussair Mazraoui is a doubt, while Lisandro Martinez remains sidelined.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up at Anfield:",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Casemiro played the full 90 minutes against South Korea and Japan during the international break, so Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will not be on Amorim's Christmas card list.",
      "Manuel Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad and he is fresh in comparison. Amorim hinted that Casemiro could be rested during his press conference, but he should start if he is physically ready to play. Ugarte has been disappointing, albeit he did emerge with credit from the first half against Manchester City.",
      "I prefer Harry Maguire on the left side of the back-three, while I would also bring Patrick Dorgu into the side at the expense of Amad. Liverpool have superb attacking quality and starting 'defenders' at wing-back is logical.",

      "This of course means no place for Kobbie Mainoo once again in the United starting line-up. Mainoo has yet to start in the Premier League this season.",
      "In the front three, we can expect to see Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko joined by Mason Mount. Mount's determination and commitment to the team can never be questioned and if he remains injury free, he could play a key role under Amorim.",
      "Predicted XI: Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Mount; Sesko",

      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" Ratcliffe told The Business podcast.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over those first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Amorim then reacted to Ratcliffe's comments in his pre-match press conference on Friday and stated that he feels the full support of United's senior management.",
      "Now, United great Keane has weighed in on the situation - and admitted he isn't sure Amorim is going to get the time to turn it around, should results and performances not improve.",
      "\"Whether he will get three years to play with depends how they do over the next few months. They have picked up a little bit - with the new attacking players they look more of a goal threat.",
      "\"But the big test is games like today. Are they going to show their quality or are they going to grind a result out? There are still question marks away from home. Yeah, they have picked up, but coming to Liverpool is a huge test and there are still huge questions marks over this group.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",

      "When former Blackburn Rovers academy coach Mike Sheron first became aware of Adam Wharton, the midfielder was just 12 years old and while it was far too early to make a judgement on what type of player he would become, there were already hints of the talent he possessed.",
      "\"I have been in and around Adam on a daily basis throughout his time at Blackburn,\" Sheron told MEN Sport this week. \"He has always been a fairly quiet young lad but he had an inner confidence about himself.",
      "\"He had a velvet touch, straightaway you were drawn to his ability to control a football and he used his body particularly well. His weight of pass was exceptional and as he got older you became more critical on how to build your team and you just had to go through him.",
      "\"He would never give the ball away, nine times out of ten he was picking the right pass out and it has been a joy watching him develop, it has been brilliant this last 18 months to see what he has been doing.\"",
      "When Palace paid £18million for Wharton in the 2024 mid-season transfer window, he was relatively unknown to most in the Premier League bubble, but at Ewood Park he had already become a firm fan favourite.",
      "Wharton grew up in a Blackburn-mad household with an incredibly supportive family and network surrounding him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reminiscing over one particular trip to Middlesbrough, it was easy to see why Sheron holds Wharton in such high esteem. \"From our point of view, as coaches, if you had a flaw in your set-up, in your session design, he would find it and he would exploit it,\" the 53-year-old who departed Blackburn in September explained.",
      "\"He would always find a solution to increase his chances of winning for his team and he made you a better coach as well, not just influencing the players around him, he made you a better coach and it was really enthralling to work around him. It is definitely rare [for a player to better you when you're a coach] and it is not something that you come across too often.",
      "\"I felt, as a coach, you never had to give him too many details, he would just figure it out for himself. Like everything else, there is more than one way to do things, so you don’t tell him what to do, you give him a broad landscape of: ‘This is the way that we are wanting to try and do things today, but overall it is down to yourselves how you go about it’.",
      "\"One story I do have of him is that we went to a day event at Middlesbrough, an Under-14s player-led tournament. Basically, all of the players would pick the teams, come up with the tactics and we just had to watch from afar.",
      "\"We actually went with an Under-13s set-up because we knew our group at the time at Under-13s was very good. It was Adam’s group, which also had Harry Leonard who is now at Peterborough and Kristi Montgomery who is in and around the first-team now, and they did exceptionally well, but I think Adam, again, was pivotal and was a major factor in us winning that tournament that day.",
      "\"He had that quiet leadership, he doesn’t shout, he doesn’t dictate but he has that inner belief about what he is doing and how to be successful. A lot of the time, he was right.",
      "\"He didn’t agree with everything that you would tell him, you would sometimes criticise his work ethic but he didn’t expend a lot of energy if he didn’t have to, and he was quite good at that. You see him doing elements of that now.",
      "\"You don’t see him running around everywhere, he just gets himself into good positions, he reads the game and that technical ability has ensured he has done fantastically well.\"",
      "A common theme of the conversation about Wharton was the midfielder's 'inner confidence and belief'.",
      "Wharton never needs to be the loudest voice in the room but he knows he can influence players and the game with his own ability. Sheron spoke with pride when remembering how Declan Rice and Harry Kane spoke so glowingly of him after his first England appearance.",
      "When quizzed about Wharton's best position in the midfield pivot, Sheron, who also worked in the youth set-up at Liverpool, insisted that the England international has the ability to suit whichever role the manager needs at any given time - even comparing him to a United favourite. \"Personally, I always felt he was best suited in and around the No.6 role,\" he continued.",
      "\"I like how they have done it at Palace as a lot of the time he is in with a Will Hughes or he is in with another player and there are two sitters. But in a team that is dominating possession, I don’t think there is much of a problem if he is the single pivot.",
      "\"His composure on the ball is second to none, he hardly ever gives the ball away, he can use both feet, read situations, he is so intelligent with his positioning to intercept but it has been a shock to see how well he is doing because you just never know.",
      "\"His game has really gone to the next level around more dynamic players and I would have him down as someone like a Michael Carrick who is really football-intelligent and composed, it really has been a joy to watch him develop.\"",
      "Such a talented player is exactly what United need to mix up their midfield next summer. The midfield department went untouched this previous window as focus gravitated towards the attack.",
      "The concern for the Reds is whether they would be able to attract Wharton without necessarily having the Champions League football which Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish suggested he would crave in the future. Fortunately for the Reds, Sheron believes that an immediate move to a Champions League club is not necessarily the be-all and end-all at this stage.",
      "\"We are all aware of United’s standing in the game and the frustrations they have had in the last couple of years, but who would have thought that going to Crystal Palace would have been a fantastic move?\" Sheron said.",
      "\"If a team sells the club to him and his family and advisors, and he feels that it is the right move for him, then I don’t think it is a case of him needing to go to Manchester City or Liverpool or Arsenal, I think it is a case of whether he gets the vibes that he is going to be valued, be a big part of the team going forward and we all know the animal that Manchester United can become. So I wouldn’t say it is a yes or a no on United, but rather whether the move is the right fit for him.",
      "\"I would put my faith in Adam, who has made a few good decisions, to make the right decision and if he thinks Manchester United is the right fit then it will be. Adam will make other players play better and other players will get their confidence up playing with him.\"",

      "Manchester United might have dropped a hint on who will start against Liverpool this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Matheus Cunha and Amad were among the players to miss full training, albeit club sources confirmed some of the absentees completed recovery work.",
      "Casemiro was absent from training because he played 90 minutes in away friendlies for Brazil against South Korea and Japan during the break. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will not be on Amorim's Christmas card list.",
      "Casemiro would have been a nailed-on starter against Liverpool, but his workload during the break raises questions over how ready he will be to start.",
      "It seems unlikely that Amorim will start the 33-year-old against Liverpool, given he has trekked halfway around the world to Asia and played the entirety of both friendly matches.",
      "That means Manuel Ugarte will be under consideration to start at Anfield. Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad for the international break and will be fresh compared to Casemiro.",
      "Ugarte was also a surprise starter against Manchester City when domestic football resumed following the September international break. He had last been seen on a pitch in the defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Casemiro was named on the bench against City and Ugarte performed well in the first half, although he didn't cover himself in glory when he made his next start against Brentford.",
      "Ugarte was expected to be a big winner from Amorim's appointment because he had thrived when they worked together at Sporting Lisbon, however, he has been unable to earn a consistent starting role.",
      "It did not reflect well on Ugarte that United looked at midfielders of his ilk in the summer transfer window.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, in the summer of 2024, and United have already conceded they need a new signing in the same mould.",
      "Fernandes and Ugarte are the most likely midfield partnership at Anfield. Ugarte does not inspire confidence, but his performance at Anfield in January should provide some encouragement ahead of Sunday's clash.",
      "Ugarte started alongside Kobbie Mainoo in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at the beginning of the year. The pair worked brilliantly together and Ugarte looked like the player United thought they were signing.",
      "Perhaps another start at Anfield will spark another improved performance from Ugarte.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "With the benefit of hindsight, Manchester United, not Liverpool, were winners of this summer transfer window as their £214m quartet shine…",
      "In the summer, Man Utd’s transfer business split opinion as they narrowly found themselves in our losers column.",
      "Meanwhile, it was difficult not to be uber-positive about Liverpool‘s business as they made an almighty statement with their £400m+ overhaul.",
      "But eight games into the 2025/26 campaign, on-field performances have forced a rather significant U-turn regarding the Premier League giants’ respective work.",
      "With Marc Guehi being the only notable exception, Liverpool secured most of their top transfer targets in key positions. They also recouped cash via sensible market opportunities, with Jarell Quansah and Harvey Elliott offloaded and given a route back, while Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz were sold for large fees.",
      "Given how well Diaz and Quansah have been performing for Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen, there is an argument that they should not have been sold, but Liverpool get a pass here due to the form of their best attacker, Cody Gakpo, on the left and the safety net of the buy-back clause for the centre-back.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim, Slot, Man United, Liverpool, Arsenal and so many more",
      "There is also no doubt that Hugo Ekitike has been a great buy as he’s comfortably been Liverpool’s best-performing summer signing, though this is where the positivity ends.",
      "Liverpool broke the British transfer record twice in the summer to sign Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, but each player has massively underdelivered this season.",
      "Isak is suffering a lasting effect of an inactive summer, and the Man Utd game, which Arne Slot said was the first to properly judge him, was another non-event for the former Newcastle United striker, who will inevitably come good even if it takes him a few months.",
      "It’s a similar story with Wirtz, who has at least shown in flashes what he is capable of, but he has not been put in the right positions to shine and is currently not doing enough to ease the scrutiny directed his way.",
      "More pressing concerns are at full-back, as highlighted as a “weakness” by Man Utd, because Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong have been nowhere near the level previously set by Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold in those positions.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "Though Ibrahima Konate had one of his better games of this season against Man Utd, Liverpool’s failure to land Guehi has had a negative impact as Virgil van Dijk has been miles off it, thus ensuring that their defence is incredibly fragile.",
      "So, in this summer’s window, FSG were far from transfer masters and were actually pretty inept as they forced through too many changes in a single window, signed the wrong profile of player in certain positions and overlooked glaring weaknesses in other departments (i.e. at centre-back).",
      "Man Utd and INEOS, meanwhile, are currently coming out smelling of roses following the summer window.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, they are far from perfect; their failure to sign a No.6 continues to bite them as they were still too easy to play through against Liverpool and were fortunate not to be punished.",
      "There is also the situation of some of the ‘bomb squad’, obviously except Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, returning to form elsewhere, but they were dead weight at Old Trafford and INEOS were at least patient enough to secure straight fees/loan with obligation to buy deals for these players.",
      "READ: Johnny rages against ‘misrepresentation’ and sympathises with Bellingham and Rashford over ‘outright lies’",
      "And unlike previously, each of Man Utd’s marquee summer signings have made a positive impact pretty much immediately this season.",
      "It is too soon to go all in on Senne Lammens being the messiah, but it is already clear that he is a clear upgrade on Andre Onana, as his calm presence has made a big difference.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are showcasing that they have the ability and mindset to step up and thrive at Man Utd, with their performances against Liverpool their best to date for their new club.",
      "And Benjamin Sesko, too, was really strong against Liverpool as he carried on where he left off before the international break when he scored in two straight games.",
      "Sesko has the necessary physical attributes to eventually become a great Man Utd striker with him, Cunha and Mbeumo giving Amorim the benefit of being able to adapt his forward line to cope with different styles of opposition.",
      "So, it is clear that Man Utd’s squad is stronger than it was before this summer’s transfer window and they have a high success rate with their signings; in the case of Liverpool it is quite the opposite.",

      "In years to come, Harry Maguire’s redemption arc will be studied. More immediately, it should be used as the template for his manager and many of his Manchester United team-mates.",
      "Maguire added to his increasing catalogue of huge goals for United by heading in a late winner to seal the Red Devils’ first victory at Anfield since 2016. No player in the near-year Ruben Amorim has been in charge has come up clutch for the manager more than the 32-year-old.",
      "A winner at Anfield. Sparking bedlam when completing the comeback against Lyon. Another late header to beat his old club Leicester in the FA Cup. He almost dug Amorim out at Grimsby with a last-minute equaliser.",
      "Those are just the goals. A theme running through Amorim’s biggest victories is Maguire’s rock-solid presence at the back. In the manager’s first derby at the Etihad, Maguire pocketed Erling Haaland. At Arsenal, in the FA Cup, he was a outstanding. Twice now at Anfield for Amorim, the centre-back has been huge at both ends.",
      "Maguire has been talismanic for this manager, and considering the depths from which he has recovered, he more than anyone else is the example to follow in the United dressing room.",
      "The apologies are never as loud as the disrespect, or in Maguire’s case, criticism, mockery and abuse. But if those who vilified the defender queued up to give him his dues, the back of the line would stretch to Ghana and the constituency of MP Isaac Adongo.",
      "He was the politician who fired a cheap-shot from his nation’s parliament when Maguire was struggling for form. Yes, that’s putting it mildly. Maguire endured a truly wretched 2021-22, coinciding with his arrest on holiday in Greece. Maguire was a man down and the world relished in piling in to give him a kicking.",
      "At least Adongo went on the record to apologise to Maguire – ‘sorry’ isn’t as shareable on socials, though, is it? – who accepted with the grace and dignity he showed for the most part through a tortuous two years.",
      "Roy Keane also admitted he took at least one of his rants against Maguire too far. But Keane and MP Adongo were just jumping aboard the biggest bandwagon of the time.",
      "Maguire was panned by pundits and singled out as a figure of fun by a media playing to its public. We were probably guilty of that somewhere along the line. And United fans – players, even – cannot claim they were above the treatment meted out to their man under seige.",
      "He was booed across the world on pre-season tours, from Australia to America and back to Dublin. Stretford Enders will always differentiate themselves from the tourists and the online fanbase, but Maguire was also jeered at Old Trafford.",
      "His club hardly helped. Erik ten Hag stripped Maguire of the United captaincy in 2023, which may or may not have been the correct call, but it is a demotion from which many players’ egos would never recover.",
      "If that was too subtle on United’s part, that same summer, Maguire would have got the message that he wasn’t wanted anymore when the club publicly agreed to sell him to West Ham. At that point, it was almost a mercy mission on the Hammers’ part, and to anyone outside Maguire’s circle, a change of scene and a fresh start seemed the only sensible choice.",

      "But Maguire showed the kind of stubbornness and mental fortitude not often seen at Old Trafford in recent years. Unlike many ex-team-mates who couldn’t run away from the circus quick enough, Maguire has repeatedly proven his determination not only to achieve personal redemption, but collective too.",
      "Amorim cannot claim to have fixed Maguire. Within half a season of rejecting a move away from United, he won Premier League Player of the Month for December 2023 under Ten Hag. But Amorim and Maguire have certainly been good for one another.",
      "It helps Maguire that his manager prefers an abundance of centre-backs in a system we know he won’t change. Perhaps the defender is fortunate too that his particular skillset is back in demand while Premier League managers explore again the aerial route to goal.",
      "That includes Amorim. When he and United get really desperate – an all-too-often occurrence in the last 12 months – Maguire is dispatched from his own box to the opposition’s to serve as Amorim’s trusted cross magnet.",
      "Do not simply attribute Maguire’s aerial prowess to size or stature. The art of winning such duels is in timing and judgement. Crosses and set-pieces were seemingly viewed as boorish by many coaches desperate to prove their purity for a while then. Now, though, the bullet header is back. And few do it better than Maguire, evidenced by the moments that will define him as a cult hero when he leaves Old Trafford of his own accord, with his bulbous bonce held higher than even he could reasonably have dreamed two years ago.",
      "Arsenal are title favourites because they are top of the actual table, but also because of a huge improvement in another Bournemouth are leading.",
      "‘Can we just bin him now despite the title?’ asks one Liverpool fan of the ever-moaning Arne Slot. He and a fair few of his players receive both barrels.",

      "Johnny Nic has the utmost sympathy for Marcus Rashford and Jude Bellingham living ‘inside a constant torrent of assumption, judgement and outright lies’.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney insists that it’s “so important” that Harry Maguire makes the England squad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Obviously it’s ridiculously early to be talking about a Premier League team of the season so far, but it’s also bloody good fun."

But the fact two have come against Big Six opposition, along with a home win over Sunderland that seems far more compelling than those previous successes against promoted teams, and even the encouraging opening-day performance against Arsenal does hint that something might actually be changing for United.",

      "Man Utd legend Dwight Yorke reckons Ruben Amorim’s side can start looking towards a possible top-six finish after beating Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "The Red Devils won at Anfield for the first time since 2016 with Amorim victorious in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since taking over last season.",
      "Amorim is still under pressure if he doesn’t keep up current form after picking up just 40 points from his first 35 Premier League matches in charge at Man Utd.",
      "And Yorke has now urged Man Utd and Amorim to build on their shock result on Merseyside and warned them not to now “fall back into the decline”.",
      "Reacting to the win over Man Utd, Yorke exclusively told Football365 on behalf of Escapist Magazine: “Massive win. I think a lot of people didn’t probably give United any chance of getting three points there, despite, you know, Liverpool not really being on song with the three defeats prior to that game. Man U getting the first win [at Anfield] for a while.",
      "“But it was never going to be an easy task with it at Anfield, we know that we haven’t won there in 10 years either, so the likelihood of getting the result, I think it was very slim. However, the boys have turned up and delivered another fantastic performance and a result that not too many people had given them a chance. And on top of that, winning two games back to back, which they haven’t been able to do. So it’s been a real uptick, and a lot of happy United fans including myself yesterday.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim, Slot, Man United, Liverpool, Arsenal and so many more",
      "“Is this the kind of result that can change United’s season? You should hope so, beating one of your rivals. We know the City derby is huge, but nothing like Liverpool. The history between those two clubs, and so you would have thought that will.",
      "“If that doesn’t give you the incentive and the additional confidence to go forward, I’m not so sure what will. So I hope that with this result and the back-to-back wins will then inspire the players that it can be done, and that will inspire them and give them the extra confidence going into the rest of the campaign.",
      "“The one thing they’ve got to be safeguarding against is the fact that after they win against Liverpool, everyone is coming after them, and you have to have a reaction for that. So what you can’t afford to allow to happen is getting these two good results, which are huge results against Liverpool, and then falling back into the decline. So it’ll be interesting.",
      "“All eyes will be on them the next game that they play. And you don’t want to make one step forward and two steps backwards. I hope they don’t fall into that old cliché one and get carried away and think that’s it and they could live on the back of just the Liverpool results. They need to kick on.”",
      "When asked what the target is for the rest of the season, Yorke added: “I think top four, it’s usually the usual standard. They’ve got to get back to the top six. Top four will be a remarkable return.",
      "“No one envisaged that, even myself, who is obviously a United fan. I’ll be happy with top six considering where we finished last season, because that’s an uptick. It’d be an uphill task. But what we see is that everybody can beat each other at any given time and United certainly can do that. But they gotta get back on a much more consistent base.",
      "“I always revert back to just beat the teams around you. Beat the teams who you are supposed to beat on paper. It’s when you’re getting beaten against those teams that it’s a bit worrying. We know they can produce these kinds of performances against Liverpool and City in the past, and you’ve got to roll your sleeves up and get results against the lesser teams.”",
      "Liverpool are not dealing well with “becoming the hunted” after winning the Premier League title last season, according to Dwight Yorke."

Slot’s Liverpool had all the flair but none of the plot. If this is Amorim’s “cunning plan,” long may the chaos continue.",

Honestly, Gakpo’s missed header near the end, you have to wonder how. While also worth noting United could have scored a couple more too with Bruno missing quite badly.",

The tiniest bit of pressure (most of that being self inflicted after spending HALF A BILLION of the king’s finest) has seen them panic.

He’s still young, some time studying Robbo would do him well.\nSalah – should swallow his pride, work on his game, come back stronger.

      "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot proved that he’s a salty Jurgen Klopp regen with two stupid comments about Manchester United on Sunday…",
      "Slot has been a media darling for most of his tenure at Liverpool and has been widely praised for his forthright assessments of games in front of cameras immediately after the final whistle.",
      "However, cracks in his image are starting to appear as pressure mounts on the Liverpool boss amid a dire run of four straight losses in all competitions.",
      "Liverpool’s mini-crisis before the international break turned into a full-blown crisis on Sunday afternoon as they were deservedly beaten 2-1 by arch-rivals Manchester United at Anfield.",
      "Subsequently, Wayne Rooney has raised a worrying change he’s seen in Slot, who has been showing similar character traits to his predecessor, Klopp, when on the end of a disappointing result.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "Klopp was the sorest of losers when things didn’t go his way and Slot stopped short of praising Man Utd by making daft comments about their playing style and Ruben Amorim’s decision regarding Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“If you play United – who come here with a low block and playing a lot of long balls and you know that is going to be difficult as it’s not easy to play through them and you don’t get the chance to win the ball high up – and you concede after one or two minutes, it makes it harder,” Slot said.",
      "“It’s always difficult to defend against a team that defends in a low block, that mainly plays long balls.",
      "“But it makes it even more difficult when you go 1-0 down after one minute when a player of ours is on the floor.",
      "“If you would have told me before the game that against the low block, against the team that plays so many long balls, we would have created as many chances as we did, I would not have expected us to lose this game of football.”",
      "READ: Slot ‘ain’t the guy’ – he’s a ‘d***head’ who can’t ‘manage his way out of this hole’ at Liverpool",
      "Before the game, Slot commented on Amorim’s decision not to start Sesko. He said: “We’ve seen Sesko play the last three, four, five or six times, but they go to Liverpool they change the line-up.",
      "“That’s not the first where we’ve faced a team and they’ve done that.”",
      "Starting with the long balls, Man Utd did play more than Liverpool (75-47) and their long pass proportion was 25.5% compared to 9.8% for their opponents.",
      "But this is only an issue in Slot’s mind because his team came up short, having been outsmarted by Amorim and his team.",
      "Put simply, Slot needs to focus on being better to quell the threat of Man Utd and other teams that have had success against Liverpool, with the Reds and their head coach made to look pretty inept by Amorim.",
      "According to Opta, Man Utd’s ratio of long passes against Liverpool was their highest since the 3-1 win over Arsenal in December 2017, so this was a tactic deployed to increase their chances of success at Anfield, which is also the case with the rotation of Sesko.",
      "Sesko being on the bench amid his strong form before the international break raised eyebrows, but this, like the focus on long passes, was an inspired decision from Amorim as Man Utd’s fluid and mobile front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount caused Liverpool’s fragile defence no end of problems.",
      "And Amorim is obviously within his rights to tinker with his XI from game-to-game to get the better of an opponent, which is exactly what happened against Liverpool and Slot.",
      "Amorim got all of his major decisions spot on as he schooled Slot, while blind panic got the better of the Liverpool boss as he and his team were deservedly punished.",

      "The 24-year-old has largely performed well for the French side since moving with 21 goals and five assists in 34 Ligue Un appearances last term.",

      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd have ‘decided to take an ambitious step in the market and is preparing an outlay of close to €100m to repatriate’ Greenwood in the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘Manchester United let Mason Greenwood leave for Olympique Marseille in 2024 for around €26 million and retains a 50% release clause on his future sale. Sources close to the English club indicate they are not satisfied with receiving that portion and want to rectify the situation with an outright purchase.",
      "‘In Manchester, they suggest that the €100 million fee would allow Mason Greenwood to be brought back without sharing profits or depending on subsequent release clauses. The club values ​​both his performance in France and his commercial potential following his improved image.’",
      "Despite a sale elsewhere meaning Man Utd ‘would still receive a significant percentage thanks to his resale clause, they prefer to assume the cost now and gain full control of the player’.",
      "When asked whether Greenwood can become one of the world’s elite if he keeps up his current form, Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi replied: “It’s true that Mason can do more, not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn’t need to do better. He’s already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",
      "“He can improve in helping the team when it needs it, when it’s necessary. But I want to protect Mason from criticism, he’s always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.”",
      "Previously speaking of Greenwood’s potential, De Zerbi said: “All the credit goes to his mother and father. And I’m here to help him become more complete. When he needs a hug, a word of support, I gladly give it. And when I need to push him to give more, I have to do that too because that’s my job.",
      "“I would especially like to help him be remembered, in this stadium and by these supporters, as one of the greatest players to have played here at the Velodrome. There have been so many great players here, but I think Greenwood has the qualities to be remembered that way. And I’m trying to help him progress.”",
      "De Zerbi continued: “If he wants to become a great player, he must run off the ball. I saw Mbappe, I saw Dembele pressing without the ball, and Greenwood has to do it too. He has worked on pressing, but not always. When he wants to, he does it, and he must understand that this effort is what separates the greats.”",

      "Liverpool are still one of the most frequent TV picks in the Premier League so far this season, with Chelsea replaced at the top by three other teams.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Leeds and Manchester United were the biggest winners from the initial December selections with four more games each.",

At least until next week’s inevitable back-to-earth-with-a-bump home defeat to Brighton, anyway.",
      "",
      "2. For Liverpool, the crisis is no longer mini. If that sounds dramatic, it is nobody’s fault but theirs. They crisised themselves here with their frankly absurd approach to a second half of a game that remained very much there to be won – or at least not lost – by more conventional methods.",
      "Liverpool gave the game away – in every sense – with their breakneck, chaos-strewn approach to the second half. Every single one of the last 30 minutes was played like it was the last, and while we suppose Liverpool’s record in injury-time means there is some logic to playing more of the game as if it was in fact injury-time, it did all just look a little bit mad.",
      "Even if it had worked here – and had Cody Gakpo’s astonishingly interesting game in front of goal not ended with a header sent impossibly wide when a second equaliser appeared certain then it may well have done – it would still have ceded the title advantage further toward Arsenal.",
      "While the Gunners go about their business for now in a composed and thoroughly sustainable manner, Liverpool have become a team for whom the Hail Mary has become too regular and too early a choice from the playbook.",
      "",
      "3. There can be no doubt that Arne Slot is under pressure like never before at Liverpool after a third straight league defeat and fourth in all, and one in which his part can be significantly questioned. There was barely an hour on the clock when he went to a sh*t-or-bust 4-2-4 formation in which Florian Wirtz was, at least theoretically, one of the two central midfielders.",
      "That is not a play a title-winning team is making when one goal down with 30 minutes remaining at home against a mid-table team that had conceded 11 goals in its first seven league games of the season.",
      "If there was one word to describe Liverpool and their manager and their star players here it was this: rattled. From quite literally the very first minute.",
      "It is not a word generally linked to serious title contenders.",
      "",
      "4. And the worst thing for Liverpool is who the most rattled players were. It is not even particularly mischievous to suggest the two worst players on the pitch today were Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah.",
      "The two players more responsible than perhaps any others for the success the club has enjoyed over recent years both had absolute stinkers in the worst possible fixture.",
      "",
      "5. Van Dijk’s day to forget began in the very first minute. He made not one, not two, but three individual errors in the immediate build-up to United’s opening goal. Four if you count colliding with team-mate Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "A poor headed clearance and clattering of Bryan Mbeumo (and Mac Allister) was followed by a tackle attempt that registered as weak-to-non-existent on the tackle-ferocity-o-meter, and then a gentle jog back towards the escalating trouble in front of Liverpool’s goal as he let Mbeumo run beyond him while airily suggesting to Ibrahima Konate that he might like to deal with this unpleasantness, please.",
      "It was a string of uncharacteristic errors from a man who has been the most reliable of all Liverpool players for so long now, but on whose 34-year-old shoulders Liverpool have placed a frankly irresponsible level of faith and expectation across this long and in theory multi-competition season.",
      "",
      "6. And he never really did regain his composure. Having had to nurse Konate through much of the first chunk of this season, today the roles were reversed to an alarming degree, with Konate clearly Liverpool’s most – and at times apparently only – accomplished defender on display.",
      "Despite a role in the build-up to the equaliser, Van Dijk’s story was one of further errors and increasing rattle. Every close-up from the TV director appeared to be of Van Dijk walking away from some new unexpected unpleasantness shaking his head.",
      "With United playing most of the game with no real number-nine, Van Dijk didn’t really seem to know what to do with himself or where to go. He was dragged out wide by Mbeumo and into midfield by Matheus Cunha, with Milos Kerkez outside him similar uncertain about who precisely should be his primary concern out of Mbeumo and an impish Amad Diallo.",
      "The visible headloss reached its peak when Van Dijk shanked a clearance into Kerkez and set about berating his team-mate for the apparent crime of not being hologrammatic.",
      "",
      "7. And then there was Salah. That was… very not good. Liverpool are missing Trent Alexander-Arnold desperately, but nobody more so than Salah, who has lost all confidence and appears to have forgotten who he is.",
      "As can often happen to great players in a rut, his decision-making has gone out of the window. Passing when he should shoot, shooting when he should pass. Running at defenders in general is just something he probably shouldn’t be doing right now; he has still yet to complete a dribble this season and lost possession 16 times today.",
      "The nadir came shortly after the hour, though, when his big chance came to bring Liverpool level as a cross arrived to him barely six yards from goal and with time to take a touch before finishing.",
      "It was just bizarre. We are talking about one of the great players of the Premier League here, but he took that chance like someone who had only had football badly explained to him by someone who’d watched half a game several years earlier while not really paying attention.",
      "We want to say he mishit his shot well wide of the target, but it wasn’t even that. It was like he couldn’t even work out which part of his boot he wanted or needed to use. He kicked it really bloody hard, in entirely the wrong direction. A slice would be bad, but it would be easier to explain than this apparent total failure to even realise what was required.",
      "",
      "8. Salah was probably fortunate to stay on as long as he did given the performance, but such is his status here and across the league that it was nevertheless striking to note he was withdrawn when Liverpool went in forlorn pursuit of their second equaliser.",
      "That new Salah contract is not looking the best piece of clear-eyed decision-making right now. Nor the starry-eyed decision to chase ever greater attacking coups in the transfer market while the more mundane but necessary business of sorting out the centre of that defence were left unfinished.",
      "",
      "9. It also feels a bit of a worry that with the player of the year in their ranks and having spent hundreds of millions of pounds on new attacking talent, Liverpool’s most effective attacking player for most of the game was Cody Gakpo, and for the last few minutes of it was Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Gakpo had an extraordinary game really, hitting the woodwork three times, very nearly slicing an attempted clearance into his own net, scoring from a yard out while getting far too close to comfort to hitting the post with that effort as well, given the whole goal was available to him, and then heading badly wide when seeming certain to equalise again.",
      "The first and third shots that hit the post were wonderful efforts, the second an attempted cross, but it is that missed header that will haunt his dreams tonight.",
      "",
      "10. Liverpool’s best moments down the right-hand side came in the few minutes Frimpong spent out there rather than the 90-odd of Salah. It was his cross from which Gakpo really should have done so much better, with another dangerous delivery arriving soon after.",
      "By this point Liverpool’s formation was barely even worth giving hypothetical consideration, but with this being not the first time we’ve seen Frimpong playing a more advanced role and Dominik Szoboszlai deployed at right-back, it all adds to the bizarroworld sensation that this is a Liverpool team where nothing is quite operating as it should, or very often where it should.",
      "",
      "11. And we’ve not even got to Isak yet. Or Wirtz. Sometimes even 16 Conclusions isn’t enough and we really do want to make at least a couple of these about what United did right rather than what Liverpool did wrong.",
      "But it was another painful afternoon for both big-money summer arrivals, with Isak’s sole contribution being to tamely fail to score a one-on-one after being brilliantly found by Konate’s throughball, and doing so in precisely the kind of way that forces the entire punditocracy by strict co-commentary law to stroke their beards and ponder thoughtfully that a confident Newcastle Isak definitely scores there.",
      "",
      "12. United, though. Let’s talk about them for a bit. Because this is a huge day for Manchester United. The performance was good, and in places excellent. But it still feels a lot like this was a day more about what Liverpool did wrong than what United did right.",
      "It’s not to downplay United’s role in it all, just that Liverpool brought such uncontrolled chaos and wildness to proceedings that in a curious way their own total lack of control and composure meant United never really had any chance to introduce their own to the game.",
      "What they did was produce a full-blooded effort all over the pitch for all 98 minutes or whatever it was in the end, and take the fullest advantage of Liverpool’s confusion.",
      "",
      "13. And that was right from the off. There was one team switched on and aware of what was happening as that first moment of significance unravelled itself before them. Mbeumo was so smartly up off the canvas and back into play after being initially clattered by van Dijk, and expertly found by Amad who was excellent throughout.",
      "His finish was more power than precision, but that was very much enough. It rattled Liverpool, and they never truly recovered.",
      "There were further chances – most involving Bruno Fernandes and/or Amad in some capacity and, even when Liverpool were making some headway of their own, never any sense of a game spiralling out of United’s control. They surely can’t have predicted or expected Liverpool’s gameplan to become quite so wild quite so quickly, but they kept their heads admirably in the face of it all, especially given what was at stake.",
      "",
      "14. But most impressive was their response to the equaliser when it finally came. It would have been so easy then for heads to drop, for the apparently inevitable to be accepted. Especially for a team that has had so many more bad days than good ones over the last year or so.",
      "Gary Neville said just before Harry Maguire’s winner that he felt there was still a goal for United here, and while the speed with which that proved true was spectacular, it was also just a straightforwardly true observation.",
      "Liverpool had chosen chaos so early and thoroughly that after the equaliser there was no way to get that toothpaste back in the tube. No way to revert to any semblance of a more measured approach.",
      "And it was a delightful winning goal, with Bruno’s cushioned volleyed cross from a cleared corner a thing of beauty that arced inexorably onto the head of Maguire with an outcome that felt a certainty from long before it played out in apparent slow-motion.",
      "And who was that marking absolutely nobody as it all played out? Mr Virgil van Dijk.",
      "",
      "15. No, there was nothing particularly surprising about United’s second goal in a game long since handed over to chaos and where reason had left the building. What was surprising was that Maguire’s 84th-minute goal, despite having far more the feeling of a goal arriving in the 94th minute, would prove to be the last.",
      "It just felt certain that this game, especially given this Liverpool team and its penchant for injury-time shenanigans, had one more nonsense in store. A Van Dijk equaliser, perhaps, for the narrative.",
      "But no. Liverpool had already treated the last 30 minutes of this game like it was injury-time, to such extent that by the time eight minutes of actual injury time rolled around they had little of their usual energy for such moments to call upon.",
      "Liverpool were beaten, United victorious, and with it a seismic shifting of the Premier League crisis plates.",
      "",
      "16. This is not yet the end of Liverpool as title contenders this season. Having seen their own five-point lead swallowed up so quickly, they should know better than ever what could happen to the four-point deficit they now have to make up on an Arsenal side who in recent history have not made good pacesetters.",
      "But it does feel now like Liverpool are back to their bit-part role in the title race, watching Manchester City duke it out with the Gunners.",
      "They are not out of it, but absolutely could be by the time the November international break comes around if upcoming games against a rejuvenated Aston Villa and Manchester City go anything like this one, with Eintracht Frankfurt and Real Madrid providing the sort of opposition that could even see the Champions League, with its safety nets designed to protect big teams at all costs, now at risk of becoming dicey.",
      "The speed with which the season finds itself in danger of collapse really is remarkable.",
      "Roy Keane has told Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk to “start with the man in the mirror” after the Reds lost to Manchester United 2-1 on Sunday.",
      "Cody Gakpo has scored a Premier League goal for Liverpool against every other member of the Big Six, with only Mo Salah ahead of him in the current squad.",
      "Jamie Carragher hit out at a Liverpool ‘baby’ who Gary Neville was left ‘stunned’ by in Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat to Man Utd at Anfield.",
      "Van Dijk was labelled a “baby” by Carragher, Salah looked more like a toddler and Isak doesn’t look worth £25m let alone £125m. The Liverpool trio were awful in defeat ...",
      "Liverpool are officially in a ‘mini crisis’ which Arne Slot and two players in particular seems to be making worse. Chelsea and Enzo Maresca took advantage.",
      "One Liverpool supporter is particularly riled at the idea Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk have ‘downed tools’. Maybe Arne Slot’s transition will just take time."

      "Former FIFA referee and ex-PGMOL chief Keith Hackett has given his verdict on Bryan Mbeumo’s controversial opener for Manchester United in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool, which “surprised” Jamie Carragher.",
      "Harry Maguire scored the late winner for United after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Mbeumo’s first-minute goal, which led several Liverpool players to confront referee Michael Oliver as Alexis Mac Allister lay on the ground clutching his head.",
      "Reds captain Virgil van Dijk had elbowed his teammate in the build-up to the goal, and the contention was that Oliver should have blown his whistle, as is the custom for head injuries.",
      "But Hackett believes the correct decision was made, with VAR unable to intervene if – as Oliver suggests was the case – the referee did not see the head injury.",
      "“Three players challenged in a fair manner for the ball which bounced and put Man United on the attack. They went in to score a good goal,” Hackett told Football Insider.",
      "“It appeared that Referee Oliver had not seen the head injury and play was allowed to continue. Goal scored and correctly allowed.",
      "“VAR cannot intervene on this it is not a clear and obvious error.”",
      "Offering up his thoughts on the incident, Carragher said on commentary: “I have been frustrated that players have taken advantage of that rule. There was an incident in the Arsenal game yesterday near the dugout, and the referee pulled it back.",
      "“I am very surprised Michael Oliver hasn’t brought it back.”",
      "Gary Neville was left stunned by Van Dijk’s role in the goal, saying on commentary: “Mac Allister goes down, but what stuns me is Van Dijk. Mbeumo runs off him; he can’t see him. That is the big surprise.",
      "“Mbeumo reacts like a boxer off the ground, and he is away. Mamardashvili can’t keep it out, a stunning start for Manchester United. I can’t work out if Van Dijk is trying to play him offside. He points towards Konate as if to say, ‘That is your man.’ It is a strange handover from him.”",
      "Redknapp added: “It is brilliant from United but Van Dijk makes a big mistake. He has to sprint back. Yes there is a collision but you have to get back into shape. He can’t just pass it on to [Ibrahima] Konate.”",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been working on a ‘secret’ Manchester United mission for ages but it’s public knowledge now, while Liverpool are always transfer geniuses.",
      "Man Utd forward Bryan Mbeumo is attempting to convince Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to move to Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Owen Hargreaves would like to see Benjamin Sesko dropped for Bryan Mbeumo in a tactical reshuffle.",

      "Virgil van Dijk was labelled a “baby” by Jamie Carragher, Mohamed Salah looked more like a toddler and Alexander Isak doesn’t look worth £25m let alone £125m. The Liverpool trio were awful in defeat to Manchester United.",
      "The narrative this season surrounding Liverpool’s defensive woes has been that Ibrahima Konate’s downturn – amid a contract standoff and interest from Real Madrid which is now cooling as a result of his slump – has been too dramatic for the brilliance of Van Dijk to nullify.",
      "But after an extraordinary passage of play in the first minute at Anfield which saw Manchester United take the lead, we were forced to consider the possibility that Konate’s decline and Liverpool’s collective malaise is in part down to their captain not quite being ‘at it’ this season.",
      "Either that or Van Dijk’s mind and body hadn’t yet woken up – and never really did – to a game against Liverpool’s fiercest rivals in which nothing short of victory would put paid to doubts over their ability to stay the course with Arsenal in the title race. Neither reflects well on him.",
      "He goes games, weeks, months, often seemingly full seasons without making mistakes, but made three – four if you count the head injury he inflicted on Alexis Mac Allister – in less than ten seconds at the start of this game, and spent the rest of the it, as Gary Neville said on commentary, “not knowing whether to stick or twist”.",
      "After clattering into the back of Bryan Mbeumo while failing to deal with a long ball, nailing Mac Allister with an elbow in the process, Van Dijk then dangled a leg in an almost comically weak effort to block Bruno Fernandes’ pass to Amad Diallo, before Mbeumo ran off the back of him to score.",
      "We’ve seen him jog back into position thousands of times, but typically in an ‘I’m far better than you so don’t need to break a sweat’ sort of way, rather than with the air of negligence we saw here, exacerbated by him vaguely pointing Mbeumo out to Konate rather than marking him himself.",
      "Milos Kerkez was having another nightmare alongside him and we must also ask questions as to what Arne Slot has done since their 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace to coach Liverpool to play against the 3-4-3 formation given their evident problems with dealing with it again here.",
      "Without a true No.9 to play against, Van Dijk was continually dragged out of position and looked genuinely uncomfortable no matter if he was out wide being faced up by Mbeumo or pulled into midfield, with those moments scrambling his brain to such an extent that by half time he was losing a physical battle to Matheus Cunha.",
      "Slicing a cross into the face of Kerkez before shouting at the full-back for failing to talk to him combined his new-found defensive inadequacy and the all too familiar Van Dijk quirk of blaming anyone else for his own mistakes. And while the Van Dijk aura returned briefly to create Liverpool’s equaliser through a fine tackle to prevent a United counter-attack, he was then seen marking no-one as Harry Maguire scored the Red Devils’ winner, with Matthijs de Ligt also free at the back post.",
      "“For most of the season Van Dijk’s been looking after a baby in Konate; it’s now the other way around,” Carragher said on commentary. But short of his much-maligned centre-back as a scapegoat, Liverpool did have two other very willing, highly respected patsies to draw focus from the entirely rattled captain.",
      "Alexander Isak missed a golden opportunity having been sent through beautifully by Konate, but hit his shot straight at Senne Lammens. He dragged another one wide, and could have played Mohamed Salah in when well place on another occasion. Slot said this week that Isak has now completed his delayed pre-season, so this is now just bad football from the £125m man.",
      "Not quite as bad as Salah though, who was as poor as we’ve ever seen him for Liverpool against the team he loves playing against most, with the nadir evidenced by him kicking the ball with the wrong part of his boot, like he was a toddler lining up the effort at the back post, when granted a golden chance to make it 17 goals in 18 games against United.",
      "The surprise wasn’t that Salah was replaced by Jeremie Frimpong in the 85th minute when chasing the game but that it took Slot that long to realise that the Egyptian was proving a hindrance to Liverpool, now in attack as well as defence.",
      "And on the back of a first United win at Anfield for a decade, after which Ruben Amorim and his players obviously deserve huge credit (which you will find in 16 Conclusions later), although the visitors played their part in the mini-crisis becoming a full-blown one, the upgrade is mainly Liverpool’s doing.",
      "Thanks to Slot for treating the last 30+ minutes as though it was the last, to two Liverpool legends in Salah and Van Dijk for shrinking when they really needed them and to the summer signing who was supposed to take this brilliant team to the next level rather than ushering in this dramatic fall from grace.",

      "Jamie Redknapp thinks “any manager in any league in England” could win back-to-back matches with Ruben Amorim’s current Man Utd side.",
      "Amorim is yet to win back-to-back Premier League matches since becoming Man Utd manager around a year ago with the Red Devils boss picking up just 37 points from 34 matches.",
      "That has led to rumours that Amorim could be sacked if those poor results persist but Sir Jim Ratcliffe hinted that the Portuguese coach could remain at Man Utd for three years as he gives him a chance to proove himself.",
      "After Ratcliffe’s comments were put to him, Keane said: “Listen, I think it’s probably good getting the backing off the club and the board, but results obviously have to improve. You hope, of course, any manager is given time. Whether he’s going to get three years to play with, it will depend on how they do over next few months.",
      "READ: Why Ruben Amorim is ‘really annoyed’ with Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes",
      "“They have picked up a little bit, we said at the start of the season, with a couple of attacking players they look like more of a goal threat, and particularly at home, they’ve improved their home record, and on the back of a nice result to home to Sunderland, which I fully expect them to win.",
      "“But the big tests are still games like today [against Liverpool]. What kind of group they have? Are going to turn up here today and show their quality going forward? Are they trying to grind the result out? Are they going to be physical? Are they going to put tackles in? So there’s still huge question marks away from home. Yeah, they’ve picked up, but coming to Liverpool a huge test for me.",
      "“There’s still huge question marks over this United group. I just don’t see it at this moment in time, but the signs are a little bit better going forward, but you still worry about in midfield, in terms of the physicality, and you worry about them defensively. And again, question marks still over the goalkeeper situation.”",
      "Carragher chipped in: “I actually want to come in on those comments, because I understand what the owner is trying to do. He’s trying to quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“So he comes out to defend his man. He talks about, you know, he’s got three years. But he almost doesn’t help him by saying it, because nobody believes it. Nobody believes for one minute that Ruben Amorim will be the manager of Manchester United in three years.",
      "“If he just said, ‘we’ve got no plans to change our coach over the next 12 months.’ I think we’d go ‘okay, maybe they could get to the end of the season. Maybe things can improve. They can get someone in January.’ That would almost feel like a vote of confidence in that, you know, quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“But to come out and say three years, we all know that, as Roy’s just said, if the results keep going as they’re going he’s going to lose his job, unfortunately. So even though he’s come out trying to help him, I don’t think he has actually helped him with those comments in the end.”",
      "Before Redknapp went in hard on Amorim for failing to win back-to-back matches at Man Utd, he said: “When you’ve not won back-to-back games in the Premier League as Man United manager, you are coming under intense pressure. I think you could get any manager in any league in England and I fancy him to pick a team with this Man United squad, and win back to back games, that would be the challenge.",
      "“And it can’t be that difficult, but he’s making it look difficult every single week, like Roy says, some weeks you watch him and say: ‘yeah, there’s glimpses here, they’ve got a chance. They’ve got some good players, good performances.’ Then it will just go back to the madness and the same substitutions. Forget the system, he’s  not going to change it whatever we say.",
      "“But you can’t not win back-to-back games as Manchester United manager and then say that he’s going to still be there three years. It just doesn’t make any sense.",
      "“It’s not the real world. And also, if he’s still there after a year, and this is not changing, the fans will dictate that. They won’t suffer it because they want to see change. They don’t like the situation the club are in.”",

      "Other than the brief spell when Cristiano Ronaldo returned to take responsibility for spot kicks, Fernandes has been United’s designated penalty taker since his joined the club in January 2020, and has scored 39 of his 45, excluding shootouts.",
      "There have been doubts raised as to whether he will continue in the role, particularly following Bryan Mbeumo’s arrival from Brentford in the summer. The Cameroon international scored 11 of his 12 penalties for the Bees.",
      "But Amorim insists he has no plans to change his penalty taker, backing Fernandes to improve his record under him, which he admits is “really annoying” given his excellence since joining the club.",
      "“I know that it’s not easy for him [Fernandes], but I think he has 70 penalties, and he misses like nine. Two with me, so I’m really annoyed with that,” the head coach said in his pre-match press conference.",
      "“But he’s really confident. He’s training the penalties, he’s trying to understand that people are watching the way he scores the penalties. So, he’ll be ready.",

      "Mainoo was denied his request to leave the club on loan in the summer and has featured for just 237 minutes to far this season; Zirkzee was also linked with the exit – a return to Serie A was mooted – and is now understandably ‘deeply frustrated’ with his 116 minutes of game time this term.",
      "It would be a bitter pill to swallow at the best of times with the World Cup coming at the end of the campaign, but in a United team struggling for creativity which either could theoretically provide, it would be fair for both Mainoo and Zirkzee to question just how bad the teammates currently preferred by Amorim would have to be for them to be given an opportunity.",
      "READ: Liverpool vs Man Utd: Five pre-match predictions from Rooney, Keane, Redknapp et al.",
      "Victory over Sunderland before the international break kept the wolves from Amorim’s door and the vote of confidence from Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggests his sacking isn’t in the offing anytime soon. But with champions Liverpool to come on Sunday as Amorim still searches for consecutive Premier League wins for the first time in close to a year at Old Trafford, the United manager’s target for the season feels optimistic as Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and others threaten the Big Six hegemony.",
      "“We want to go to Europe,” he said ahead of the clash with Liverpool. “We need to return to Europe.",

      "“I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. Players are not playing. They want to play, and there’s a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players, talking all the time.”",
      "The cost of failing to qualify for Europe last season, beyond the financial implications, is the lack of opportunities afforded to those not in the first XI this term; being dumped out of the League Cup by Grimsby Town exacerbates the problem.",
      "Manchester United will have played 20 games this season before the January transfer window opens. Clubs competing in Europe will have played 27 if they reach the Carabao Cup quarter-finals.",
      "Aside perhaps from a congested Premier League fixture list around Christmas, Amorim doesn’t and won’t have the same need to rotate as other big-club managers. If he’s not going to field bit-part players on the back of international breaks that they haven’t been a part of ahead of those that have, as we strongly suspect will be the case at Anfield on Sunday, what hope do Mainoo or Zirkzee have of getting enough game time to stake their World Cup claims?",
      "Amorim might claim he “needs” them, but amid what will be growing pressure from agents and a perfectly possible negative dressing room atmosphere created by frustration and perceived injustice, the United chiefs may feel as though they have little option but to grant the exit wishes of Mainoo and Zirkzee.",

      "Manchester United pulled off a shock victory to beat the Premier League's reigning champions Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield but how did they do it? We pick out the key reasons why Ruben Amorim was able to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time...",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 21:52, UK",
      "",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemed surprised by United's team selection from the outset as Amorim omitted Benjamin Sesko despite the striker scoring in his previous two Premier League appearances for the club and starting in each of the last four.",
      "In fact, it wasn't. Matheus Cunha took on the centre-forward duties, but did not give Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate such a reference point for them to mark. \"If we [play] Ben I think it is easier for these type of centre-backs to control our striker,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was also rewarded for his positive decision to keep Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo together on the right rather than opting for a more defensively-minded wing-back. It paid off in little over a minute when the pair combined for the opening goal.",
      "Milos Kerkez, Liverpool's summer signing from Bournemouth, has been targeted by numerous teams this season and that appeared to have been identified as a weakness United could exploit. \"Kerkez does not look comfortable,\" said Jamie Carragher early on.",
      "Kerkez's uncertainty seems to have had a knock-on effect on the once imperious Van Dijk. \"Normally the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence gets punished,\" pointed out Gary Neville. \"But today it's the left hand side. Kerkez and Van Dijk have struggled.\"",
      "The goal immediately increased the tension inside Anfield. Van Dijk was urging Ryan Gravenberch to be calmer as early as the sixth minute when the midfielder attempted an ambitious pass in behind. \"We were far too rushed,\" said the captain after the game.",
      "Slot repeatedly referenced United's use of long balls afterwards but that was a smart play at Anfield, denying Liverpool the opportunity to win the ball high up the pitch through their pressing. Senne Lammens booted the ball away time and time again.",
      "In fact, the Belgian goalkeeper has the lowest pass completion rate of any Premier League goalkeeper to play 180 minutes this season. The top two goalkeepers? Giorgi Mamardashvili and Alisson Becker, both of Liverpool. A clash of styles. United's won out.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim got his tactics spot on at Anfield,\" said Carragher while analysing the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"It's not just about going long; he didn't pick [Benjamin] Sesko, he picked [Matheus] Cunha to be under the ball.",
      "\"The important thing to notice is how narrow the players are, it's not about going long, it's about picking up the second ball.",
      "\"It was all about picking up the second ball. Look how narrow the five players are. That's where the first goal comes from.",
      "\"The tactic of going long was spot on.\"",
      "Inevitably, Liverpool pushed in the second half, Slot's bold substitutions just after the hour mark meaning wave after wave of attacks towards the Kop followed. The home side got their equaliser but Amorim noted afterwards that the response was crucial.",
      "\"We managed well when we suffered the goal, we managed that moment well and that is the key point for our team.\" The momentum was with Liverpool but United managed to retain enough composure to stay in it and find a winning goal of their own.",
      "It came from the second phase after a corner. Amorim had included Harry Maguire because of his aerial ability in his own box, but it proved decisive at the other end of the pitch. Liverpool have now conceded five goals from set-pieces already this season.",
      "\"Defending in a set-piece at 1-1, it happened to us at Palace and again today,\" said Slot. The Liverpool boss pointed out that his team created far more from open play but acknowledged that set-pieces are part of the game. \"That is something we have to do [better].\"",
      "There was still time for Liverpool to equalise but Cunha came into his own in those closing stages. \"Cunha has one characteristic that can help the team move forward,\" Amorim said beforehand and he showed in late on, often getting United up the field.",
      "\"More or less all the transitions was Cunha. He was so far from the centre-backs and that helped us to take the ball,\" said Amorim afterwards. The Brazilian could be seen celebrating after winning a free-kick in stoppage time. His role was vital for United.",
      "Carragher also went on to explain on Monday Night Football how United's use of a 5-4-1 formation out of possession allowed Amorim's squad to remain compact throughout the fixture, with their only moments of weakness arriving when the team became separated as a result of players pressing Liverpool.",
      "\"The talk of the low-block, it was the right thing to do,\" Carragher said.",
      "\"On a couple of occasions, when United tried to go after Liverpool and press, that's where they had problems. If they got caught out, there was space in behind.",
      "\"That's when United they are at their worst, when the team are spread out. The team are separated. It comes from them pressing high. They were right to not go after Liverpool and to play in a 5-4-1 low-block.\"",
      "Of course, Liverpool had their chances and Cody Gakpo, who had hit the frame of the goal three times before scoring, could and should have had a second. But Neville summed it up well. \"When you come to Anfield, you need a little bit of luck.\" United earned theirs.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Mac Allister needed treatment and had to play on wearing protective headgear but VAR could not intervene as there was no foul. Guidance from the Premier League Match Centre suggested referee Michael Oliver did not stop play as he did not see the injury.",
      "The dramatic opening set the tone for a pulsating game with Manchester United initially resisting Liverpool's efforts to equalise with the help of some luck. Gakpo struck the post three times before finally hauling the hosts level when he tucked home substitute Federico Chiesa's low cross.",
      "The out-of-form Mohamed Salah had also missed two gilt-edged chances but it felt like Liverpool were primed to find a winner before Maguire struck to spark more jubilant celebrations from Manchester United, who might have had a second goal in the first half had Fernandes not fired wide from a big chance.",
      "Liverpool tried to rally again in the closing stages but Gakpo missed a glorious opportunity, heading wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross when it looked easier to score, leaving them to face up to a fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2014, having also been beaten by Chelsea, Galatasaray and Crystal Palace.",
      "A momentous victory for Manchester United means they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim. It puts them only two points behind Liverpool in the table, with the champions four points off leaders Arsenal in third.",
      "\"In the first five or six games it was about the signings we made, now it's about Mo Salah.",
      "\"We had more than enough chances to score. Mo missed a big one. Some others missed a big chances. We are not used to this.",
      "\"We needed a goal, but we needed a player who could create something in that end phase. That's what Jeremie [Frimpong, who came on for Salah] did, he had a great action, crossed to Cody.",
      "\"If we had been 3-0 up, Cody would have scored. I cannot guarantee this. So every player has tried everything. But it didn't work out for us.\"",
      "\"It's three points but it's a good victory. I will do the same thing I did in the last few games which is try to see the game back.",
      "\"In key points we had some luck, but we fought for every ball.",
      "\"We lost our composure in the second half. But the most important thing was the spirit was there.",
      "\"That is the beginning of everything. Sometimes you play more with the ball, other days you play without the ball.",
      "\"But if you have the spirit, you can win any game.",
      "\"They had had the better of us over the last few years and it's not been good for our club.",
      "\"We have not given our fans enough days like today, so it has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points.",
      "\"It is not just three points to the club and to the boys. I have been coming to this ground for seven years now and to not get three points has been tough. It's for the fans and I hope they had a great night tonight.",

      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.",

      "Sunday 19 October 2025 20:52, UK",
      "",
      "Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz in a midfield two? It was surely not the plan at half past four in the afternoon, let alone in the summer. But this was Liverpool with a little over an hour gone against Manchester United at Anfield. Let the chaos ensue.",
      "It has been their season in microcosm, a wildness highlighted on the opening night of the campaign in a prickly conversation between Arne Slot and Jamie Carragher. Liverpool beat Bournemouth that evening. But the control they had is clearly gone.",
      "They created enough chances to beat Manchester United. Slot was at pains to point that out. Cody Gakpo struck the frame of the goal on three separate occasions. Mohamed Salah missed a chance so inviting that Curtis Jones was already celebrating.",
      "\"I do not think it is usual that we are missing so many chances. This weekend again, set-pieces are such a crucial part. We are the team that creates the most in open play, I don't think that has changed. But that is not the only way to win a game.\"",
      "He is right. Liverpool have created 85 chances from open play, the most of any team in the Premier League. But he is also right to mention the defending from set-pieces. There is a vulnerability to Liverpool now and the two may be related. It is about balance.",
      "Milos Kerkez shone for Bournemouth last season but is struggling at left-back, targeted each week by opponents who sense weakness. Virgil van Dijk looks less sure of himself too, leaving that flank exposed. The captain himself was culpable for the opener.",
      "There was an irony to Van Dijk preaching calm afterwards because more urgency from him might have helped instead of allowing Bryan Mbeumo to drag himself from the deck and sprint in behind the Liverpool defence to fire United ahead after 62 seconds.",
      "Composed can soon come to be seen as lackadaisical once the goals start going in against you. It is 11 conceded after eight Premier League games this season compared to the miserly three that gave Liverpool the platform for success last time out.",
      "Too often, Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up. \"When you are 1-0 down, you need to take more risks,\" said Slot. Hence, the sight of his Galacticos arrowing forward towards the Kop late on, all talent and no cohesion as they chased goals - and lost.",
      "\"I think we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch and that may be the reason why the structure of a set-piece against Palace and now was not as perfect as usual because normally you play four or five defensive-minded players,\" Slot explained.",
      "There is an element of living and dying by that same sword. It was not so long ago that Liverpool were snatching games late on having gone chasing for the winner. Now, they are losing to late goals. Three points for a win might well justify the approach in the end.",
      "In terms of expected goals, this was the highest total that Liverpool have racked up in any Premier League game since beating Southampton in March. But when Jamie Redknapp talked of \"an air of desperation\", you understand what he meant by it.",
      "On paper, Liverpool have some splendid players. On the pitch, the blend is still not right. Slot appears willing to trust that things will click very soon. But his team will need to make sure their rivals don't snatch the crown while they are figuring it out.Adam Bate",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro against Liverpool surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Rubem Amorim had cited his set-piece threat before the game and he delivered just when he was needed.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",

      "\"I suppose I might have been a surprise package last year, but now people know about me and know my game.\"",
      "And his start to the season, without a goal in seven games, reinforced how he has become a marked man.",
      "Head coach Unai Emery wasn't prepared to give up on him, though. Rogers has started all of their Premier League and Europa League matches.",
      "\"He is always doing his task. He is a hard worker,\" explained Emery. \"And through it, the performance is coming.",
      "\"He's playing and he's scoring because he's helping the team for 90 minutes.\"",
      "Rogers' stunning strike against Tottenham was the only shot he had during the match. It was a bolt from the blue, but one that can help reinstall his confidence after a tricky period in his career.David Richardson",
      "The sound of boos at the full-time whistle has become a regular occurrence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs' home form is alarming. Their supporters have seen just three wins at home in the last 18 Premier League games.",
      "In fact, the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa means it is Tottenham's poorest home start to a league campaign since 2008/09.",
      "Since November 10 last year, Spurs have lost more home games than any other ever-present Premier League side.Frank has been unable to solve an issue which developed under his predecessor Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Asked to explain their home struggles, the Dane said at his post-match press conference: \"I don't think it's that simple. It's about looking into the performances.",
      "\"I think we performed well against Burnley, I think we performed well today. I think we had one very good first half against Wolves, and we were bad against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We could easily have won it instead of Villa, and then it would have been a different narrative, so I look at the performance on the pitch at what we did well and look at what we need to improve.\"",
      "Frank, then, will be relieved their next three games are all away."

      "Gary Neville says the next few weeks are \"crucial\" for Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era - and believes they should be able to get into the top six after a dramatic win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "United have risen to ninth in the table following Harry Maguire's 84th-minute winner against arch-rivals Liverpool, after Cody Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's 61-second opener.",
      "\"This is a complete turnaround game,\" said Neville about the win over Liverpool on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought if United lose here, which they were more than likely to do when I saw the team sheet, I'm thinking Ruben Amorim is going into that Brighton game under real pressure with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come.",
      "\"They've got a kickstart springboard from what they've done, because to win at Anfield is special in any season, to win here is the hardest ground. They should be really proud because it's a big achievement, but they've got to kick on from here.",
      "\"So it's a great day for Manchester United, but let's see it again next Saturday night against Brighton.\"",
      "Neville cited the recent defeat at Brentford in September as a prime example for United to avoid. Amorim's side had just beaten Chelsea at home in a big game to kickstart their season - but a defeat to the Bees a week later put United back where they started.",
      "\"So what can't happen is now we've got to this height of performance, and then all of a sudden Brighton ends up being a dip,\" said Neville. \"So the next couple of weeks are huge, I think, for Ruben Amorim to start to build.",
      "\"Amorim has got to start trusting those players. I know we talk about trusting Ruben Amorim and him being under pressure, and that's always going to be the case with the manager, but Ruben Amorim wants to be able to trust his players.",
      "\"I know he likes them, and I know the players like him, you can see that. There's no sort of players losing the dressing room type stuff, which we have seen with United many times.",
      "\"There's no doubt those players admire their coach, they like him as a person, but they've got to start trusting each other, trust the system if you're the players, but also Ruben Amorim, trust his players that they can deliver consistently.",
      "\"I'm just looking towards next week now. Enjoy tonight because it's one of the greatest moments you can have as a United player, winning at Anfield, and it happens rarely, so enjoy tonight.",
      "\"But honestly, lads, you've got to get back at it tomorrow morning, you've got to switch on and focus, because next Saturday will kick you right where you don't want it to kick you, if you're not at your best.",
      "\"Brighton are a good side, so really start to focus so hard on that in terms of everything that you do this week.\"",
      "Neville believes the United squad are capable of finishing in the top six - not just because of the quality of their squad, but also the lack of European football giving them free weeks of training all season.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Because they've got to get to a point whereby there's stability at the club, the only way there's going to be stability is through winning football matches.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got a top six squad, particularly when you know that they haven't got European football, and they haven't got the Carabao Cup now.",
      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them. And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",
      "Amorim admitted he will not dwell on or celebrate this victory too much, with the Portuguese fully aware of the importance the Brighton game will bring next weekend.",
      "\"It [victory over Liverpool] doesn't mean a lot. It means [a lot] today. But tomorrow it is not going to mean a lot. It's three points but it's a good victory.",
      "\"It will give us more confidence in the week. It will give us a lot of pleasure to our fans who deserve it after Grimsby and Brentford. To have a win like this is really important. That is on our hands. This game is in the past, let's focus on the future.\""

      "By Peter Smith and Zinny Boswell",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Giorgi Mamardashvili - 5",
      "Mamardashvili talked up his readiness to replace Alisson while he was away on loan last season but looked nervous on this big stage - perhaps flustered after failing to save Bryan Mbeumo's early drive through him.",
      "Could do little about Harry Maguire's header but also spilt a Matheus Cunha cross and was fortunate Mason Mount couldn't tuck away the loose ball. There were a couple of good stops midway through the first half but unconvincing.",
      "Conor Bradley - 6",
      "Misplaced just one of his 26 passes but will be frustrated not to have troubled the United defence. Miscontrolled in the box at start of the second half when he looked primed to deliver a dangerous cross. Off after an hour and saw Szoboszlai go into his right-back spot. That position is still up for grabs.",
      "Ibrahima Konate - 6",
      "Out-jumped by Harry Maguire for the winner to spoil what had been an otherwise impressive performance. Konate has copped plenty of flak this season but it was he who was regularly covering for centre-back pal Virgil van Dijk on Sunday. He couldn't get across to stop Mbeumo's goal but made plenty of other interventions amid the chaos of that first half and played a fantastic pass for Isak's big one-on-one chance.",
      "Virgil van Dijk - 5",
      "Usually imperious but Van Dijk was at fault for Mbeumo's goal, clattering his team-mate Mac Allister and ending up out of position before strangely trying to hand over the goalscorer to Konate. Turned by Cunha and needed Konate to cover in one of several examples of the Dutchman being caught out. His passing and aerial threat were there - his authority was not.",
      "Milos Kerkez - 5",
      "The left-back looked overawed in the first half and had to be told to calm down by Van Dijk on a couple of occasions. Their miscommunication continued in the second half when his centre-back kicked the ball in his face. Didn't look comfortable up against Amad.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch - 6",
      "Set the tempo at the base of Liverpool's midfield, playing a deeper role than he has ventured into at times this season but rolled his ankle worryingly early in the second half and had to come off soon after.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister - 6",
      "Jamie Carragher says if Mac Allister can get back to his best then Liverpool will too - but he was off the pace again here. Clattered by Van Dijk in the build-up to United's goal and needed treatment. Then had little impact in the first half before sparking a counter and shooting over in the second. Subbed off on the hour.",
      "Dominik Szoboszlai - 7",
      "Hit some fine long-range passes but it was his incisive forward balls through the middle of the pitch which got Liverpool moving forwards. His 100 per cent passing accuracy at the break dipped in the second half but continued to contribute defensively and offensively when shifted to right-back.",
      "Mohamed Salah - 5",
      "The most goal involvements of any player in Premier League history in this fixture - but he's miles away from his stratospheric levels of the past right now. Shot horribly wide when he looked set to score in the second half after fluffing a volley from a corner. There was a brilliant pass into Gakpo earlier but a combination of positioning and form has blunted his threat. Hooked with Liverpool needing a goal at 2-1 and that said it all.",
      "Alexander Isak - 5",
      "Arne Slot said his British-record £125m striker is ready to start firing now - not on this evidence. The big chance came in the first half when Isak fired his one-on-one chance at Senne Lammens. He snatched another shot wide from distance and saw an ambitious effort blocked away by Luke Shaw later. Not what Liverpool paid the big bucks for.",
      "Cody Gakpo - 7",
      "Scored one equaliser. Should have scored another, heading wastefully wide after tapping in for 1-1. Earlier was involved as Liverpool hit the woodwork not once, not twice but THREE times, with a deflected cross sandwiching two blasts against posts. Liverpool's most dangerous attacker but will leave Anfield kicking himself for that miss.",
      "Subs",
      "Hugo Ekitike - 6",
      "Lost his place to Isak and came on looking like a man with a point to prove, firing just wide not long after his introduction before missing the target with another dig.",
      "Florian Wirtz - 6",
      "A little pass to Federico Chiesa allowed the Italian to tee up Gakpo for the equaliser. That was some encouragement for the £116m man who had been benched again and has seen his run of no goals or assists in the Premier League go on. But he remains a big dilemma for Slot.",
      "Curtis Jones - 6",
      "Tried to add energy to Liverpool's forward play and fired a shot on target but couldn't come up with a moment of magic in a fixture he'd love to win more than most.",
      "Federico Chiesa - 6",
      "Another big Anfield moment for Chiesa this season to cross for Gakpo to thump in the leveller - but this time his late intervention didn't earn Liverpool points.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong - 6",
      "Another high-profile summer signing who started on the bench but should have had an assist when he nipped to the byline and crossed for Gakpo. His long-term role in this team still uncertain.",
      "Senne Lammens - 7",
      "Held his own in a hostile environment in his second Premier League start. Big save with his leg to deny Isak in the first half. One of five saves he made. Little he could do for the equaliser. Continued to look confident claiming crosses and brought calm to the defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 6",
      "Lost Gakpo for Liverpool's equaliser and headed over from close range with his side 2-1 up. It didn't matter in the end.",
      "Harry Maguire - 8",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and scored the winner at Anfield. He missed a chance to win the game in the same fixture last season but made no mistake this time with his head. The hero for his team once again.",
      "Luke Shaw - 6",
      "Timid defending showed Gakpo inside when he struck the post soon after the restart. Isak stuck to him in the hope of finding joy but only really got free once when Lammens denied him.",
      "Amad Diallo - 8",
      "Perfectly weighted through ball for the opener. Ran Kerkez ragged down the right as he finally clicked with Bryan Mbeumo. Undoubtedly their best game playing together. His team lost something when he was taken off.",
      "Casemiro - 6",
      "Lasted nearly an hour and put in a decent shift as the deepest midfielder after a quick turnaround from international duty playing in South Korea and Japan. The 33-year-old was unremarkable but did a job which is good going after playing two full games for Brazil.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 8",
      "Covered every blade of grass and looked exhausted late in the second half but had enough in the tank to produce a stunning volleyed assist for the winner. Should probably score to make it 2-0 in the first half, but more than made up for it in the end.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 5",
      "Nervous performance at left wing-back. His poor pass high up led to Liverpool's counter when Gakpo struck the post.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 8",
      "Good finish for the opener to set his team up perfectly in a hostile environment. His influence waned in the second half but he set his team on their path to victory. Always a threat cutting in.",
      "Mason Mount - 6",
      "Did a defensive job for his head coach as the false nine. Struggled to influence the game much in an attacking sense. Forced one save and could have scored to make it 2-0 if he had anticipated the ball bouncing for him in the box.",
      "Matheus Cunha - 7",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and caused Liverpool problems in the first half starting on the left of a front three that was fluid in possession. Was less effective offensively after the break when his team dropped deeper but never shied away from taking the ball.",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte - 6",
      "Replaced Casemiro after nearly an hour but had little impact on the game. Made an important block deep in stoppage time to stop a Liverpool cross into the six-yard box. His best moment.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - 5",
      "Nervous when he came on to replace Amad. Beaten by Ekitike twice in the lead-up to the equaliser and then could not block Chiesa's cross. Too easily beaten.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 6",
      "Replaced Mount after an hour and had a limited role. Best chance was a through ball over the top that he took down nicely only to be ruled offside. Played a nice ball in to Cunha that came to nothing.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - N/A",
      "Replaced Fernandes with five minutes to go and touched the ball just twice.",
      "Leny Yoro - N/A",
      "Replaced Shaw with five minutes to go and did not have enough time to impact the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
