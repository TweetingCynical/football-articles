      "Alejandro Garnacho was left ‘unable to move’ after his first Chelsea training session. The Argentine winger is already hard at work following his £40m switch from Manchester United.",
      "But those expecting Garnacho to have an instant impact at Stamford Bridge might have to bide their time. The forward did not have a pre-season at Old Trafford ahead of his move having been exiled by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And that has left him somewhat off the pace when it comes to his fitness. After his first training session with the Blues, Garnacho revealed he was already feeling the effects.",
      "Speaking to a member of the Blues’ media team, Garnacho said: “Can’t move my legs now man.\" He added: \"I sprinted in the last one.”",
      "Garnacho was left out of the Argentina squad for the current international break so Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca will be hoping that he can build his fitness over the next few weeks. Explaining what he could bring to the Blues, the Italian coach said: “When we are looking for a winger, we are looking for someone who is good one-v-one and who can attack and create something.",
      "“Jamie Gittens [signed from Borussia Dortmund this summer] is that profile, and we will see with Garnacho. He is a good winger in one-versus-one and he can create things. This is the way I see things.”",
      "One star who was however called up was Garnacho’s international and now club teammate Enzo Fernandez. And it appears that the midfielder was very keen to see the move get over the line.",
      "“I spoke to Enzo during the summer because he had been asking a lot of times, ‘When are you coming, when are you coming?,” Garnacho said.",
      "“I kept saying that he had to be patient, and we would play together. He texted me when I joined to say congratulations, and I can’t wait to see him and play together. I had to be patient too, but now I can’t wait to get started.”",
      "Should Garnacho get up to speed as planned, he could potentially make his debut for the Blues in just over a week’s time. The Blues travel to Brentford next Saturday, where they will aim to continue their unbeaten start to the campaign.",
      "He will be made to wait for his home debut though - Chelsea’s next outing at Stamford Bridge not coming until September 27 against Brighton. The Blues take on Bayern Munich, Garnacho’s former club Manchester United and Lincoln City away from home before then.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "While Manchester United spent more than £200million on summer signings, Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo was the one who got away. United head coach Ruben Amorim met with the Ghana international, it has been claimed, only for Semenyo to agree a new deal at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "\"I’ve grown so much at the club, both on and off the pitch, and I’m really happy to have signed ahead of returning for pre-season,\" Semenyo told club media after signing an extension until 2030. “From the fans to the staff and my teammates, I can’t speak highly enough of the people around the club.\"",
      "Newcastle and Tottenham were both linked with the 25-year-old, though interest cooled after he agreed his new deal. According to The Transfers Podcast, though, United were interested since the spring and pushed hard for a move.",
      "Ruben Amorim is reported to have met Semenyo for dinner in London at the end of last season to judge the player's character. CEO Omar Berrada and transfer chief Jason Wilcox also held conversations with Bournemouth over the former Bristol City star, but to no avail.",
      "United were ready to fork out £55million on Semenyo, valuing his proven Premier League quality. However, the player himself is said to have committed his future to Bournemouth after learning United were planning to pay him less than what they offered to other targets.",
      "Those targets, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, both joined United for more than £60m. Cameroon international Mbeumo is already off the mark for his new club, scoring in a 3-2 league victory over Burnley, but Cunha was injured during the same match.",
      "Semenyo has kept up his good form for Bournemouth after scoring a career-high 11 league goals last term and 13 in all competitions. He scored both goals for the Cherries as they faced Liverpool on the opening weekend of the season, and also set up Marcus Tavernier's winner in a victory over Wolves.",
      "He scored home and away against United last season as Bournemouth won at Old Trafford and conceded a last-minute equaliser in the reverse fixture. The two teams won't meet until December this season.",
      "Bournemouth's ability to hang onto Semenyo was important in the light of a number of high-profile summer exits. Three members of last season's back four completed big-money exits, with Milos Kerkez joining Liverpool, Illia Zabarnyi moving to Paris Saint-Germain and Dean Huijsen making a dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "The Cherries also cashed in on Dango Ouattara, who joined Brentford for around £42m, with Philip Billing and Mark Travers among the fringe players to move on. Andoni Iraola's side have also spent big over the summer, making defender Bafode Diakite the second most expensive signing in their history and also picking up Djordje Petrovic and Ben Gannon Doak from other Premier League clubs.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro avoided a red card after standing on the leg of a stricken opponent while playing for Brazil. The Selecao enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 win over Chile in World Cup qualifying on Friday at the Maracana in a match that saw a nasty foul by Casemiro go unpunished.",
      "Goals from Chelsea winger Estevao, West Ham playmaker Lucas Paqueta and Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimaraes saw Carlo Ancelotti pick up his second win in his third game as Brazil boss. It was a chance for Ancelotti to experiment, with Brazil already assured of their place in next year’s World Cup, while Chile sat bottom of the group with their chance already gone.",
      "Estevao put the home side in front by heading in a deflected shot from close range before Casemiro was fortunate not to be sent off on the stroke of half-time. The veteran midfielder clearly stood on the leg of Chile midfielder Felipe Loyola, who writhed around in pain on the floor.",
      "The United star appeared to look down as he planted his foot, before looking up at the referee and apologising to his opponent. He was shown a yellow card, and with no VAR in operation, escaped any further punishment.",
      "Ancelotti’s side made the game safe midway through the second half when Paqueta headed in Luiz Henrique’s cross at the back post. Guimaraes then grabbed a goal of his own by converting from on the goal line.",
      "Brazil were already assured of their place at the 2026 World Cup, which takes place across Canada, the United States and Mexico. Ancelotti took over as manager this summer following the dismissal of Dorival Junior at the end of March.",
      "The former Real Madrid manager is in his first role as an international boss and will be under huge pressure for results following a turbulent period. His arrival is good news for Casemiro, who played under the Italian coach during his successful period at Real.",
      "Casemiro has 77 caps for the national team and is still a starter at Manchester United at the age of 33. He has started all three of United’s Premier League games this season in holding midfield, with Ruben Amorim not trusting Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte in the position alongside captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Asked what his ambitions were for the season, Casemiro told the United club website: “To have a great year. To have a great year at the top level, because at the end of the season we have the World Cup.",
      "“So, I want to arrive at the World Cup in good form. I want to enjoy the year, to arrive in top form, and it is the title that I am missing. So, I want to win titles here. We have new signings of top quality that will help us a lot.”",

      "Daniel Levy has stepped down as Tottenham's executive chairman after almost 25 years at the club. And an admission made by the iconic Sir Alex Ferguson summed up his shrewd and often frustrating negotiating skills.",
      "Levy, who joined the Spurs board in December 2000, has been the figurehead behind the north London club's move from White Hart Lane to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He now steps down with no changes being made to his ownership or shares in the club, as the Levy family will continue to own 29.88 per cent of the share capital of ENIC.",
      "It comes hot on the heels of Vinai Venkatesham's arrival as Chief Executive Officer, while Peter Charrrington has joined the board and stepped into the role of Non-Executive Chairman, in what has been described as a move prioritising sporting success.",
      "Levy was renowned during his time with Spurs for his approach to transfers, building up a reputation as a shrewd negotiator with an eye for a deal. However, these tactics rubbed legendary Manchester United boss Ferguson the wrong way when the two were pitched against each other in negotiations over Dimitar Berbatov 17 years ago.",
      "Berbatov eventually sealed a switch from White Hart Lane to Old Trafford for £30million, although the bitter fallout saw Tottenham complain to the Premier League over the move. Afterwards, Ferguson was less than complimentary when reflecting on the negotiations.",
      "\"That whole experience was more painful than my hip replacement,\" he penned in his book, Leading, displaying just how difficult Levy was to deal with, effectively paying the now-63-year-old a backhanded compliment about his negotiating skills.",
      "After Levy's exit was announced, he released a heartfelt statement: \"I am incredibly proud of the work I have done together with the executive team and all our employees.",
      "\"We have built this club into a global heavyweight competing at the highest level. More than that, we have built a community,\" he continued.",
      "\"I was lucky enough to work with some of the greatest people in this sport, from the team at Lilywhite House and Hotspur Way to all the players and managers over the years.",
      "\"I wish to thank all the fans that have supported me over the years. It hasn't always been an easy journey but significant progress has been made. I will continue to support this club passionately.\"",
      "Charrington will now step up as the Non-Executive Chairman, and he stated after joining the Tottenham board: \"I am very honoured to become Non-Executive Chairman of this extraordinary club and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Daniel and his family for their commitment and loyalty to the club over so many years.",
      "\"This is a new era of leadership for the club, on and off the pitch. I do recognise there has been a lot of change in recent months as we put in place new foundations for the future. We are now fully focused on stability and empowering our talented people across the club, led by Vinai and his executive team.\"",

      "England's top flight has paused due to the first international break of the season, allowing teams to take stock of where they're at following the opening weeks. Liverpool sit top with the only 100 per cent record and yet none of their players make the list so far.",
      "They've been impressive going forward with Hugo Ekitike hitting his straps early, but the Reds have by no means produced scintillating performances to secure their three wins. They conceded four times in their first two games - against Bournemouth and Newcastle - and needed late winners on both occasions to pick up the three points.",
      "None of Arsenal's players have earned enough 'Opta points' either - which is what has determined the early rankings. They are metrics that measure contribution to games via actions such as goals, tackles, and goal conceded. A player who plays 90 minutes will typically end up with totals between 10 and 40 points - and the player at the top of the tree averages 31.7 so far.",
      "Caicedo's influence in midfield has long been lauded and he will be a crucial figure for the Blues. Another midfielder sits in second in the form of Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, who is now in the England fold.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah has enjoyed a renaissance at Chelsea have previously been cut adrift by Enzo Maresca, but he's now become an influential figure in the backline. Tottenham's Guglielmo Vicario is the only goalkeeper in the top 10 after he kept two clean sheets.",
      "Two playmakers in Bruno Fernandes and Lucas Paqueta, both men who've been on target this season, are ranked in fifth and sixth and continue to have major influence over games, particularly in the final third. Joao Pedro's impressive start at Chelsea has him in eighth.",
      "The Brazilian has scored twice in his three games since moving from Brighton. His Blues' team-mate Enzo Fernandez is narrowly ahead, meaning Chelsea have four players in the top 10, by far the most of any club. They remained undefeated with their only dropped points coming in the goalless draw with Crystal Palace.",
      "Despite Manchester City's below par start to the year Erling Haaland scrapes into the top 10. He has scored three times, finding the net twice against Wolves. His former team-mate Jack Grealish has also enjoyed an impressive start to life at Everton as he bids to reignite his career.",

      "The 22-year-old winger joined the Tangerines on August 5, signing a two-year contract with the option of a further 12 months. He arrived from Crystal Palace, where he spent three years, gaining experience on loan with Hull and Oxford and with Belgian side RWD Molenbeek.",

      "A statement on September 4 read: “Blackpool Football Club can announce that Malcolm Ebiowei has left the club by mutual consent. The club wishes Malcolm all the best for the future.”",
      "Ebiowei made just four appearances for the club, the last coming against Plymouth on August 23. Speaking upon his arrival, he spoke of his excitement at joining the club.",
      "\"I’m really grateful to be able to work under someone like Steve Bruce, and can’t wait to get going,” he said. “The conversations we had were nothing but positive and I’m really looking forward to the future here and playing in front of the supporters.”",
      "Bruce said: “We are delighted to welcome Malcolm and look forward to watching him in action. He possesses real ability and is a tricky player to come up against. He is the kind of player that will get our supporters off their seats, and we look forward to welcoming him into the group this week.”",
      "That never materialised for Blackpool, but there was genuine hype surrounding Ebiowei three years ago after he made 16 appearances for Derby. After deciding to leave the Rams, who were relegated from the Championship following a 21-point deduction, he reportedly had the choice between United and Palace.",
      "Having been born in south London, he chose to head home, signing for Palace, whose chairman Steve Parish underlined the hype surrounding Ebiowei. “I’m delighted that Malcolm has chosen Crystal Palace as the best place to continue his development, following his impressive breakthrough into senior football in recent months,” Parish said.",
      "“He is a highly coveted young player, and we very much expect to provide a platform for him to flourish at the highest level.”",

The former Manchester United boss decided in May that Leverkusen would be his first managerial job since leaving Old Trafford last October, but he was gone after just 60 days.",
      "\"This decision was not an easy one for us,\" Leverkusen director for sport Simon Rolfes said when Ten Hag got his marching orders after just two league games. \"Nobody wanted to take this step.",
      "\"However, the past few weeks have shown that building a new and successful team with this setup is not feasible. We firmly believe in the quality of our team and will now do everything we can to take the next steps in our development with a new setup.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wrexham brought in 13 new players during the summer transfer window after spending a whopping £33million. The window closed on Monday as the Red Dragons recruited three fresh faces on deadline day.",
      "Midfielder Ben Sheaf was signed from Coventry City for a reported fee of £6.5m, while Blackburn Rovers defender Dominic Hyam joined in a deal worth £2.7m. The Hollywood-owned club also secured a move for Manchester City wing-back Issa Kabore on a season-long loan.",
      "The closure of the window brought to an end a busy period for manager Phil Parkinson, but Wrexham could still do further business. The Championship new boys announced on Thursday that they have registered 24 players for this season, leaving a space open for a potential free agent signing.",
      "There were some notable names absent from the list, including goalkeeper Danny Ward, who faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after suffering an elbow injury against Millwall last weekend. Midfielders Ollie Rathbone and Andy Cannon and striker Jay Rodriguez were also left out as they battle with their own injuries.",
      "Meanwhile defender Eoghan O'Connell's future at Wrexham has been thrown into doubt following his exclusion from the squad. Whether Parkinson decides to fill the vacancy with another new arrival remains to be seen, but it would not be surprising after he added Matty James and Jon Dadi Bodvarsson as free agents last season.",
      "Former England midfielder Dele Alli has found himself without a club once more following the mutual termination of his contract at Como after featuring just once for the Serie A outfit. Dele joined the Italian side on a free transfer in January on an 18-month deal, and was hoping to revive his career after an extended absence caused by injuries, addiction and mental health struggles.",
      "However, the 29-year-old's spell with Como turned into a nightmare when he received a red card less than ten minutes after coming off the bench during Cesc Fabregas' team's 2-1 loss to AC Milan at the San Siro in March. Wrexham, owned by Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, are now among the bookies' favourites to sign Dele and help get him back on track.",
      "He was previously a crucial player for Tottenham and has earned 37 caps for his country, helping to guide them to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals. Dele's pedigree could therefore prove useful for Wrexham as they aim to reach the Premier League.",
      "Wrexham made a bold move to sign Christian Eriksen during the summer following his departure from Manchester United. Despite being impressed by the club's offer, the 33-year-old rejected the opportunity to relocate to North Wales after expressing his preference to continue playing at the highest level.",
      "However, with the Danish international still unattached, Wrexham could be tempted to revisit their interest. Eriksen, whose career includes stints at Ajax, Tottenham, Inter Milan and Brentford, boasts an impressive CV.",
      "Eriksen is currently reported to be training with Swedish side Malmo as he continues his search for a new club. It would represent a significant signing for Wrexham if they could tempt him to make the move.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Wrexham also have the opportunity to explore another previous target in Patrick Bamford following the striker's release from Leeds United. The 31-year-old, who boasts one England cap, recently left the Premier League newcomers by mutual agreement after a seven-year stint at Elland Road.",
      "It followed news last month from manager Daniel Farke that Bamford was not in his plans for the current season and would be expected to train with the under-21s if he chose to stay. Upon leaving Leeds, Bamford confessed to feeling \"raw\".",
      "If Wrexham did choose to sign him, they'd be getting a player who scored 60 goals in 205 appearances for the Whites following his £7m switch from Middlesbrough in 2018. Bamford has achieved promotion from the Championship twice with Leeds and shone during their initial return to the Premier League in 2020, bagging 17 goals.",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",

      "Manchester United have suffered a fresh injury blow after Diogo Dalot was sent home from international duty by Portugal. Dalot, 26, becomes the Red Devils' third injury woe in the space of the week after Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount were both forced off during Saturday's dramatic 3-2 win at home to Burnley.",
      "In a statement released on Thursday, the Portuguese Football Federation said: \"Full-back Nuno Tavares was called up to the National Senior squad this Thursday to replace Diogo Dalot. The international, who plays for Manchester United, complained of muscle discomfort and was released by the Health and Performance Unit.\"",
      "The news comes after Cunha updated fans by saying that he'll be 'back soon'. The forward was forced to pull out of Brazil's squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers.",
      "\"What an incredible environment, it's great to be here,\" Cunha posted on Instagram. \"Ill be back soon, always with joy and gratitude. Thanks for all the messages.\"",
      "Amorim expressed his concerns about both Cunha and Mount - the latter of whom came off at half-time - following the victory over Burnley, United's first win of the season. \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "\"I don't know [if the pair suffered long-term injuries], I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",
      "Amorim will hope to have both players available as soon as possible, with United due to play local rivals Manchester City following the international break. The Red Devils will then face Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the next international fixtures in October.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Cunha, who United paid Wolves £62.5million to sign in June, has impressed Amorim in his short time at the club, where it's been a difficult start to the campaign, with two defeats and one draw before the Burnley match. \"He's a loud guy that's really important in this moment,\" the Red Devils boss said.",
      "\"When he's upset, you can feel it in the environment and that's good. When you play some games and he loses, he's a different guy, and that's good. He has some characteristics that we miss last season, so I'm really happy with him and the other guys.\"",

      "Michael Owen has told fans he's in no doubt Manchester United will be sticking by Ruben Amorim. That's despite claims from Phil Jones that some of the head coach's current crop potentially \"don't like him\".",
      "Not only has Amorim been able to spend more than £200million at leisure to improve his squad, recruiting the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but he's had a full pre-season tour to prepare the team for the season ahead. Former Red Devils striker Owen has reminded people that it's a sign the club's top brass are standing by Amorim.",
      "In conversation with A Bola, 45-year-old Owen said: \"I think Manchester United is a patient club. Of course, they can't go year after year without doing things well. Man United gave Ruben Amorim almost a year, and it was a very poor year in the Premier League.",
      "\"They've never finished so low in the table. Many clubs would say that's not enough, that they need a new manager. But Manchester United stuck with him, and I think it's a good decision.",
      "\"They spent a lot of money, which shows they have confidence in him. You hear all kinds of rumours, but not about the club wanting to change. They're showing loyalty, that they believe in the manager. I believe that, in the short term, Ruben Amorim still has the club's trust.\"",
      "With a loss, a draw and a win to show for their efforts against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley respectively this season thus far in the Premier League, United fans may harbour questions with regards to if Amorim is indeed the right man for the job. Meanwhile, a shock Carabao Cup exit to League Two's Grimsby Town last month piled further pressure on the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite never having played under Amorim, given that Ten Hag was still at the helm of the Red Devils when he called time on his own footballing career, Jones believes that there may be unrest within Amorim's camp. Speaking to Ladbrokes, the centre-half, who racked up 229 appearances for United between 2011 and 2023, said: \"Do I think there were players at United who didn’t like him?",
      "\"To be honest, that's probably a ridiculous question because I’d say there are people in the United team now who don’t like the manager. But there are probably players at Man City who feel the same way about [Pep] Guardiola; they can’t stand him.",
      "\"There are people like that in every team; these are big groups of players and different personalities, and all of them are competitive, and think they should be playing more than they are. That will never, ever change.",
      "\"Even when a manager is flying, there will always be someone going ‘Well, he’s not playing me, so he’s not good.' Trust me, I’ve been there myself. I’ve been a young kid moaning about training being rubbish. But in reality it’s not rubbish; you’re just hurt and you don’t know how to deal with it.\"",
      "Amorim thankfully has a week to tinker with his tactics during the international break before United's next Premier League clash. However, he will have to inspire an incredible performance to get the better of Guardiola's Manchester City when they return to action at the Etihad Stadium for the first Manchester derby of the season on Sunday, September 14.",

      "Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag cost Bayer Leverkusen a huge €100,000 (£86,000) for each day he was in charge of the club, it has been claimed. Ten Hag was sacked by Leverkusen after just three competitive matches, with only two of them coming in the Bundesliga.",
      "Ten Hag was handed a tough task after taking over from Xabi Alonso. Leverkusen cashed in on a number of members of the 2023-24 double-winning squad, including Florian Wirtz and Granit Xhaka, leaving the new boss with a significant rebuild operation on his hands.",
      "He was only given 60 days at the helm, though, with Leverkusen pulling the trigger after the team threw away a 3-1 lead to draw with 10-man Werder Bremen. Ten Hag picked up one point from his two Bundesliga games in charge, though he did oversee a 4-0 cup win away to fourth-tier Sonnenhof Großaspach.",
      "According to Bild, the source of the reported €6m payout figure, Leverkusen were ready to ditch Ten Hag even earlier than that. The publication reports that the boss \"managed to turn all departments, bodies, and players against him in a very short time\".",
      "Even before the sacking was confirmed, Bild report, the club was conducting transfer business without their manager's knowledge. Former Real Madrid defender Lucas Vazquez joined as a free agent after talks with managing director for sport Simon Rolfes, with Ten Hag alleged to have only met the player after a medical was passed and contracts were signed.",
      "\"A parting of ways at this early stage of the season is painful, but we felt it was necessary,\" Leverkusen CEO Fernando Carro said following Ten Hag's dismissal. Rolfes added that: “This decision was not an easy one for us\".",
      "\"Nobody wanted to take this step,\" Rolfes continued. \"However, the past few weeks have shown that building a new and successful team with this setup is not feasible. We firmly believe in the quality of our team and will now do everything we can to take the next steps in our development with a new setup.”",
      "Ten Hag, for his part, was furious the club didn't give him longer to make his mark and pointed to his record of winning silverware in previous jobs. His summer spending came in at just under £150m, with Wirtz accounting for more than half of £200m in sales, with former Premier League stars Mark Flekken and Jarell Quansah among the new arrivals.",
      "“A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play,” the former Ajax boss wrote. “I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret.",
      "“The decision by Bayer Leverkusen’s management this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a coach after just two league matches is unprecedented.",
      "“This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust.",
      "\"A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play. I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret.",
      "“I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust. Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success.",
      "“Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware. Finally, I would like to thank the Bayer Leverkusen supporters for their warmth and passion, and I wish the squad and staff every success for the remainder of the season.\"",

      "The Slovenian made a £74million switch from RB Leipzig in the summer and has been tipped to help solve the goalscoring issues at Old Trafford. So far though Sesko has only been used from the bench, appearing as a substitute in all three league matches.",
      "In those cameos he's struggled to make much of an impact and is still waiting for his first goal in his new colours. The 22-year-old arrived with a reputation as one of Europe's best young forwards and hit double figures in the Bundesliga last season.",
      "Now in England though Sesko has acknowledged that the demands are far higher with the level of football going up. As a result he's improving as he rubs shoulders with some high quality players and believes his best football will come.",
      "He told Ekipa: “The level of the matches is certainly much higher, the players and teammates are also at a higher level. After all, English football is at the highest level in the world of football.",

      "Sesko's only start came in the embarrassing Carabao Cup loss at League Two Grimsby Town. The striker copped criticism for stepping up late in the shootout, but it later emerged that the Slovenian had been struggling with cramp, hence his late inclusion.",
      "Ruben Amorim passed up the chance to bring on Sesko during Saturday's win over Burnley, which did raise eyebrows. When Matheus Cunha was forced off in the first-half the United boss instead chose to bring on Joshua Zirkzee, with Sesko getting 20 minutes at the end.",
      "Nevertheless Amorim is adamant that Sesko has a huge ceiling and believes he will enjoy a stellar career at Old Trafford. He said when he signed: “I think he has great potential in everything he does.",
      "\"He can play different types of football. He's going to feel that the Premier League is really aggressive, he's going to learn, but he has a great potential and I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. That's why we paid so much money - to have a striker that will have his history in our club.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo was disappointed to see Manchester United misfit Antony join Real Betis instead of linking up with him in Saudi Arabia. It's reported that the Old Trafford icon wanted to see Antony as an Al-Nassr player before agreeing on a return to Spain instead.",
      "Antony's tumultuous three-year spell in England officially came to an end on Monday after United agreed a cut-price sale to Betis. The Brazilian spent the latter half of last season on loan in Seville and re-joined Los Verdiblancos for £19million, less than a quarter of the £82m fee United paid Ajax for his services in 2022.",
      "But long before his Betis comeback was signed off, Antony was understood to have been the subject of interest from Ronaldo's Al-Nassr side. And the five-time Ballon d'Or-winner himself is understood to have green-lit the transfer, having spent a brief spell as team-mates with Antony at United.",
      "Appearing on Radio Marca, journalist Marcos Bernat lifted the lid on Al-Nassr's interest in Antony's signature: \"There were negotiations with Al-Nassr, the player heard about the interest, and Cristiano's entourage even took it for granted. At that point, Cristiano was in favour of the move, and they let the player know.\"",
      "In the end, Al-Nassr moved their interest to other targets, such as the more affordable Kingsley Coman. That invited Betis to revisit a deal, which was eventually made a reality on deadline day.",
      "It's believed 2026 World Cup selection was another priority for Antony, making it more of a priority to remain in Europe. Doing so would improve his prospects of being selected by new Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti, who omitted Antony from his latest squad.",
      "The winger cut an emotional figure when he was presented to the Betis fanbase for a second time. Except this time, he had signed for the club on permanent terms and broke down while discussing the difficulties he faced in England.",
      "\"Only my family knows how hard it was to be there,\" said Antony through tears as he was unveiled as Betis' big summer signing on Tuesday. \"Training separately. But I knew this incredible moment was coming. Of course, I was afraid it wouldn't happen in the end, but I waited because I had so much faith.\"",
      "A move to the Saudi Pro League might have given Antony an improved chance of becoming a star once again. But after already impressing during his six-month loan in Spain, he can leave England with confidence that he's in the right environment to rebound under Manuel Pellegrini.",
      "Antony has also since revealed he turned down interest from Bayern Munich in order to move back to Betis. He told Cadena Cope this week: \"One day before the deal was completed, I spoke to the people at Bayern But when I spoke to Bayern, I told them that the deal with Betis was 95% complete, and that I would honour my word.",
      "\"I would do so out of respect and love and because I know that I am very happy here. I don't know if they were offering me [£6m salary, or £115,000 a week]. With all respect I have for Bayern, which is a world-class club, I am at ease with the decision I've taken. I don't know what will happen in the future but I feel very calm about the decision I've taken.\"",

      "Former West Ham captain Kurt Zouma has made the unexpected move of joining Romanian outfit CFR Cluj. French centre-back Zouma was a free agent after leaving the Hammers at the end of June, so would have able to move outside the transfer window, though Romania's window remains open until September 9.",
      "Zouma, 30, played more than 200 Premier League matches for Chelsea, Stoke, Everton and West Ham. He spent last season on loan at Saudi Pro League side Al Orobah, but didn't make the move permanent.",
      "Cluj have signed the Frenchman after finishing second in Romania's SuperLiga last season. However, they missed out on European qualification after defeat against Hacken in the Conference League play-off round.",

      "Zouma's move means nine of the 14 players used by West Ham in their 2023 Conference League final victory have now found new clubs. Alphonse Areola, Tomas Soucek, Lucas Paqueta and Jarrod Bowen are the four who remain at the London Stadium, while Michail Antonio remains without a club as he steps up his recovery from serious injury but has been training with the Hammers.",
      "The entire back four from that win against Fiorentina left East London this summer. Vladimir Coufal joined Hoffenheim on a free transfer after his West Ham contract expired, while Nayef Aguerd and Emerson both made deadline day moves to Marseille.",
      "While Zouma's wait for a new club is over, a number of former Premier League stars are still unattached. Among them is Zouma's former West Ham team-mate Lukasz Fabianski, who turned 40 earlier in the year.",
      "Ex-England international Dele Alli is also available to sign for a new club outside the window, having agreed a mutual termination of his Como contract after just one Serie A appearance. Elsewhere, Takehiro Tomiyasu has yet to find a new club after leaving Arsenal, while Christian Eriksen is waiting to decide his next steps after three seasons with Manchester United.",
      "Some other free agents have been more successful, though. Eriksen's former United team-mate Victor Lindelof joined Aston Villa on deadline day, and Jamie Vardy moved abroad for the first time in his career after joining Serie A newcomers Cremonese.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has claimed that he arrives at Napoli as \"a better football player\" following his two years at Manchester United - where he largely underwhelmed before securing his loan switch.",
      "The Dane moved to Old Trafford two years ago in a deal worth £72million, but struggled for much of his time in the Premier League, which prompted the Red Devils to go back into the market this summer to address their goalscoring issues.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came in and relegated Hojlund to a squad role with the ex-Atalanta man failing to appear in the early games of the season, making his exit almost inevitable. It was in Italy that he first made his name and now he'll hope to aid Napoli's ambitions.",
      "He joins the Serie A champions, who have also added Kevin De Bruyne from Manchester City, and is relishing the chance to play in a successful team having been at United during a difficult period. Despite his struggles, which saw him score just for league goals last term, Hojlund is confident he heads to Naples as an improved player.",
      "The 22-year-old told Napoli's club media: “I was very excited, because it’s a team that just won the league. I also know how great the fans are, the city, and I’m very happy for this opportunity. It’s different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I’m a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience.",
      "“I played in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, and in multiple countries. I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.”",
      "Hojlund's deadline day move to Napoli will see the Manchester outfit will receive a £5.2m loan fee and £38m next summer with the Italians having an obligation to buy, provided that Antonio Conte's side qualify for the Champions League, which they are expected to do.",
      "Hojlund has gone straight into Napoli's Champions League squad with Romelu Lukaku left out. The Belgian is current injured and not expected back until the end of the 2025 - leading Conte to avoid taking risks over his fitness. The Italians will take on Manchester City and Chelsea during their European campaign.",
      "Their new signing has already pledged to go above and beyond to prove himself as he said: “I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything.”",

      "Manchester United's new goalkeeper Senne Lammens has vowed to be “a rock” at the back for Ruben Amorim's side. United signed Belgium Under-21 keeper Lammens for an initial £18.2million on deadline day following early-season blunders from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "Lammens is viewed by United as their long-term future No.1 between the posts and the 23-year-old said he can bring calm and stability to Amorm's unreliable and leaky defence.",
      "“I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,” said Lammens. “They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",
      "“My parents are also really calm and collected, but [I also developed this mentality] from growing up, when I was in the youth team and I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life.",
      "“I think one of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.”",
      "Lammens also opened up on the process he goes through before and after every game, and the methods he employs to stay cool under pressure. ”Before and after the game, I just write key words down and my thoughts a little bit,” said United's newest recruit.",
      "“Sometimes, if you don't do that, it can be a lot going through your mind. It helps me with staying calm and staying in the moment a little bit, and not overreacting in situations.",
      "\"I write key words, trigger points. Maybe you're playing a team who put a lot of pressure on and then you know you don't have to think a lot during the games, so mentally you're already ready, already prepared for the game and what it's going to be like. So, when the game comes, you're not going to be so surprised by it. I think that's important.”",
      "The arrival of Lammens has cast doubt on the futures of Bayindir and Onana, with one of them set to leave for a club in Turkey or Saudi Arabia, to bring balance to Amorim's goalkeeper options.",
      "As well as Lammens, Bayindir and Onana, Amorim also has veteran keeper Tom Heaton as part of his squad, with one needing to depart before the transfer windows close elsewhere.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "date": null,
    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "Jeff Stelling claims Manchester United had a \"poor\" transfer window after failing to address major issues. That's despite backing from the board and more than £200million spent on new signings like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"I thought it was absolutely essential and they haven't done so. Yes, they've got Kobbie Mainoo but he hasn't got the sort of legs required to drive that midfield forward.\"",
      "However, Amorim dismissed the idea, saying last month: \"I want Kobbie to stay and he needs to fight for his place. We need Kobbie. That is not going to change. The players not playing with be disappointed but everyone will have opportunities. You have to fight in the week.\"",
      "Mainoo was eventually prevented from departing, yet the Red Devils made minimal efforts to bolster their veteran midfield. Despite prolonged speculation linking them with Carlos Baleba throughout the transfer window, Brighton's eye-watering £100m valuation for the player remained beyond United's reach for now, particularly after Amorim had allocated a substantial chunk of the club's budget towards revamping the attack.",
      "Nevertheless, Stelling also questioned the club's decision to pursue 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who arrived at United in an £18.2m switch from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. While the Red Devils had been connected with Aston Villa's unsettled Emiliano Martinez, they eventually settled on Lammens, who is nine years younger than the Argentine and represents a considerably more economical choice on paper.",
      "Although he offers the advantage of youth to Amorim's roster, he lacks the crucial Premier League know-how that 32-year-old Martinez possesses, considering his stellar performances for Villa across the last five years. And it's precisely this experience that Stelling reckons could have proved invaluable moving forward.",
      "He added: \"And, they've gone for the cheap goalkeeper option. Lammens might turn out to be a fantastic goalkeeper but it's a humungous step for him to go from playing for Royal Antwerp in front of 12,00 people in the Belgian league to huge crowds at Old Trafford. For me, Emi Martinez was the obvious choice for Manchester United.\"",
      "While Amorim claimed he was satisfied with his goalkeeping options earlier in the transfer window, the Portuguese boss appears to have since identified weaknesses in both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana's performances. Bayindir has started all three of United's Premier League matches this campaign, and faced criticism following the Red Devils' disappointing 1-0 opening day defeat to Arsenal.",
      "The 27-year-old made a hash of clearing a corner kick, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to ghost in at the far post and net the winning goal. Meanwhile, Onana was given the nod during United's Carabao Cup encounter with Grimsby Town last month, where he too was slated for mistakes that helped the League Two outfit establish a commanding 2-0 advantage before the interval.",
      "Although strikes from Mbeumo and Harry Maguire levelled proceedings, they were eventually knocked out following a nail-biting penalty shoot-out. United have endured a patchy start to the league campaign with one victory, one defeat and one stalemate from their first three outings, and Amorim will surely be demanding a more spirited display when they return to action after the international break for the Manchester derby come Sunday, September 14.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Owen has opened up on struggling to deal mentally with his decline during the latter stages of his career at Manchester United. The former England striker admits he felt \"embarrassed\" by how dramatically his level fell during the second half of his playing days, admitting it was \"killing him inside”.",
      "Owen burst onto the Premier League scene as a 17-year-old at Liverpool, quickly establishing himself with his lightning pace in behind defences and clinical finishing ability. He claimed the league's golden boot award in his first two full seasons before making his mark on the international stage with a stunning strike against Argentina aged 18 at the World Cup 1998.",
      "After playing a pivotal role in Liverpool's Treble success with the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup in 2001 - which earned him the Ballon d'Or - he secured a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2004.",
      "Owen spent just one campaign in La Liga before his £16.8million switch to Newcastle, where persistent muscle injuries meant he was sidelined for lengthy periods across the following four seasons on Tyneside. His fitness woes continued at Manchester United and later Stoke City, with the striker eventually opting to retire in 2013.",
      "The 45-year-old recently appeared on the Rio Presents podcast, where former Red Devils team-mate Rio Ferdinand asked him about the drop off from going from an elite environment to one that isn’t. Owen instead reflected on his own career, explaining he views it in two distinct halves: pre and post injury troubles.",
      "The pundit said: “Well, I've said before, I mean, I sort of split my career into two. Almost Liverpool and maybe Madrid. And then afterwards, because I just wasn't the same. Not that I didn't like it. I loved it at United. I love you and the lads and whatever.",
      "“But I'm not me. I'm not me. You know what I was when I was 18. And you know what I was when I was 30. It's like, I was half embarrassed. I'm coming out, they've been to these big stadiums, St James' Park, Old Trafford, with my name on my back.",
      "“It's like, can I not just change my name and just think of something, like call me something else? I don't want people to remember me like this. Still good, still scoring. But I'm not what I was. It's killing me. But it's like, what can you do?”",
      "Owen's time at Liverpool saw him score more than 20 goals in all competitions in each season but two. Following his 16-goal haul in 45 appearances for Real Madrid, his numbers plummeted dramatically as injuries mounted and his electric pace diminished.",
      "Speaking about his spells at Newcastle, United and Stoke, he candidly said: “I had it for eight years, when I'm thinking, ‘I don't like this.’ I was looking at the clock half of my career, thinking only 20 minutes. And I could still score. I could still play well.",
      "“I couldn't rip a team's heart out anymore. I could just finish if I get the opportunity. I'm relying on everyone else now. Whereas I used to be able to, I didn't need anyone else. Just give me the ball and I'll do it. And that change of mentality.",
      "“I didn't retire because of my body. I still played in a game the other day. I retired because my mind was about to explode. And I couldn't have it anymore that I was just a Premier League player.”",
      "Though his displays failed to meet his own lofty standards, Owen's time at Manchester United delivered an elusive Premier League trophy in 2010/11, along with another League Cup victory. He ended his career with an impressive record of 222 goals across 482 matches, alongside 40 goals in 89 England appearances.",

      "Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott thinks Ruben Amorim will have left Manchester United by Christmas. The Red Devils started the new season in promising fashion, albeit with a 1-0 loss against Arsenal.",
      "Though this defeat was valiant, and buoyed by recruits Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, the horizon looked bright. A 1-1 draw against Fulham soon darkened such hopes, and a Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby Town was a new low.",
      "A last-gasp 3-2 victory against Burnley followed, but the win was not convincing, and an injury to new man Cunha acted as yet another stain on a campaign still in its infancy. Being knocked out of the League Cup on penalties to a relative minnow brought with it calls for the manager to be sacked. While such suggestions have quieted, Lescott still thinks that by the new year, United will have a new manager.",
      "After the international break, a daunting trip to the Etihad and rivals City beckons for Amorim. Pep Guardiola's side have not started the season well either, and Lescott insists both managers are under duress.",
      "\"The pressure is on for both managers [Amorim and Guardiola],\" stated Lescott on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"Different types of pressure, though.",
      "\"Pep's job isn't under threat, but Amorim's is, yeah,\" continued Lescott before predicting that Amorim will be 'gone by Christmas'. He added: \"I'd be very surprised if he (Amorim) is still there by Christmas. If he is there in January 2026, they're just being stubborn. He looks lost.\"",

      "Lescott, who played at the Etihad from 2009 to 2014 and made 160 appearances, further feels like Amorim's Manchester counterpart, Guardiola, has had his City exit signalled via new recruits.",
      "Asked if City are preparing for life without Guardiola, Lescott responded: \"Yeah, maybe. You're going to have to. The standards may be different this season because it's a new era, you know.",
      "\"When you've got experienced players who have been there for a longer period, they are the ones who get you through tough times. Whereas now, there's [Tijjani] Reijnders, [Rayan] Cherki. They're all experiencing negativity together for the first time. So who is going to get them out of it?",
      "\"I think, like prior to Pep, a lot of this summer's signings are post-Pep. Just like when they signed Kevin [De Bruyne], Delphy [Fabian Delph], Raheem [Sterling], they all signed before Pep arrived, but they were for Pep.\"",
      "Guardiola extended his stay in Manchester late last year by penning a deal that expires in 2027, and he told ESPN: \"After my contract with City, I'm going to stop. I'm sure. I don't know if I'm going to retire, but I'm going to take a break. How I want to be remembered, I don't know.",
      "\"All coaches want to win so we can have a memorable job, but I believe that the fans of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City had fun watching my teams play. I don't think we should ever live thinking about whether we're going to be remembered.\"",

      "Last month, a Manchester United staff member touched on the future of Rhys Bennett.",
      "\"Rhys has his sights set high,\" they said. That comment was perceived as Bennett wanting a loan in the Championship, but perhaps it was alluding to the youngster's ambition to break into the senior squad.",
      "In the final days of the transfer window, United sources said Bennett could still go out on loan, which seemed the most logical option for the defender after his Fleetwood Town stint.",
      "However, it became clear in the final hours of deadline day that Bennett was unlikely to leave.",
      "That leaves the 21-year-old in an interesting situation because he has clearly outgrown academy football. Bennett will only gain match fitness from playing for the Under-21s in the first half of the campaign.",
      "Could Bennett contribute to the first-team squad? With the benefit of hindsight, maybe that is what the United staff member meant, so don't be surprised to see him in training at Carrington.",
      "Bennett has not made his first-team debut for United, although he could sense an opportunity after Tyler Fredricson was involved. Fredricson was named on the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, and he started against Grimsby Town before being hooked at half-time in the Carabao Cup debacle.",
      "Fredricson made two senior appearances last season. Bennett is slightly older, more experienced after his Fleetwood loan and may fancy his chances of usurping his fellow academy graduate in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "No player emerged with credit from the Grimsby performance, but it was a particularly tough evening for Fredricson, who received an earful from Amorim throughout the first half.",
      "Fredricson has always had a strong reputation in academy circles. Bennett is also highly regarded and captained the Under-18s to FA Youth Cup success at Old Trafford in 2021/22.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Dan Gore starred in that supremely talented young team, but Bennett was the captain and opened the scoring in the final against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In the last three years, Bennett has watched Mainoo, Garnacho, Gore and Charlie McNeill make their senior United debuts. He shared the dressing room with those players during the FA Youth Cup run, but he's been forced to bide his time and work hard to get a sniff of a potential opening.",
      "Has that opening finally emerged? The Denton-born lad has the next six months to achieve what he dreamt about as a kid: a debut for United. The time is now for him to push toward making it a reality.",
      "It won't be easy for Bennett, but he must back himself to progress after watching Fredricson receive minutes. They play in the same position and Bennett will think he can achieve what Fredricson has.",
      "Bennett should be hardened from his Fleetwood loan last season. The centre-back made 38 appearances across all competitions and gained crucial experience of fighting for points each week.",
      "\"That has been massive for me and I like having that bit of added pressure to games and scenarios,\" said Bennett last season about playing competitive football with Fleetwood.",
      "“When I was younger, I used to get carried away with thinking, ‘what's the next couple of years going to look like?’ You can lose focus on what's in front of you right now. It’s still in the back of my mind, but the focus is on the next game and getting the most out of this.”",
      "The elephant in the room is that Bennett is unlikely to feature prominently. Amorim has Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw; Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven and Noussair Mazraoui as options for the back-three.",
      "Lisandro Martinez will also return from the sidelines in the coming weeks. However, injuries could completely change the state of play and Bennett will be ready if an opportunity arises.",

      "Kone was taken to hospital and the fixture was abandoned with no replacement ambulance available. The midfielder stayed in hospital overnight but was discharged in the morning to recover at home.",
      "Neither side had scored at the time of the abandonment. It's understood the fixture has been difficult to rearrange due to conflicting schedules, but an agreement has been reached to meet again on Tuesday, December 16.",
      "The new date means United's opening group-stage game in the National League Cup will now be against Brackley on Tuesday, September 16.",
      "Shortly after the fixture was abandoned, United released a statement saying: \"Manchester United's game at Tamworth was abandoned close to the end of the first half.",
      "\"The tie was halted due to a head injury suffered by Reds midfielder Sekou Kone, inside his own box, and the youngster was taken off on a stretcher.",
      "\"We can confirm Sekou is conscious, stable and communicating with United’s medical team. He has been taken to hospital, as a precaution, for further checks.",
      "\"Everybody at the club wishes him a speedy recovery.\"",
      "Kone was making his first competitive appearance of the season against Tamworth. Ruben Amorim named Kone in the USA pre-season tour squad this summer, but the youngster didn't make an appearance.",
      "Amorim named Kone in three Premier League matchday squads last season - against Tottenham, Everton and Nottingham Forest - but the youngster is still waiting to make his senior debut.",

      "Phil Jones has backed Ruben Amorim to succeed at Manchester United this season.",
      "United recently crashed out of the Carabao Cup second round against Grimsby. Amorim admitted that sometimes he wants to \"quit\", although United sources insisted that comment was tongue in cheek.",
      "Amorim went through the emotions on the touchline during the win against Burnley before the international break, which was sealed in added time thanks to a Bruno Fernandes penalty.",
      "The conversation around Amorim's future would have intensified during the break if Burnley had won at Old Trafford. United should have wrapped up the game by half-time, and Burnley manager Scott Parker praised Amorim's impact when he spoke at his post-match press conference.",
      "Jones was speaking to Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction and shared his Amorim verdict.",
      "\"I’ll tell you where I’m at with Amorim… I like him,\" he said. \"I like the transparency he has between the players and the fans – and I think that’s certainly been something we’ve missed over the last few years.",
      "\"I think certain previous managers have missed a trick, because if you’re transparent with this fanbase, they will back you all the way; they will sing your name and cheer for you.",
      "\"Look, he came in straight away and said things were going to get worse before they got better, and that’s been the case. I like his authenticity; he is who he is, and he’ll face criticism for it.",
      "\"But he’s not going to change for anyone. He owns it. He inherited a squad which wasn’t his, halfway through a season, who were used to playing a different way. Let’s just give him time.",
      "\"Let’s not be too hasty. He’s at United, so that’s easier said than done at times, because there’s all this talk around him being on borrowed time, and that kind of talk snowballs with every bad result.\"",
      "Jones continued: \"I think we all just need to calm down a little bit and see what happens. You know, I know things didn’t work out in that Europa League final, but he was 90 minutes away from getting the team back in the Champions League after a few months in charge.",
      "\"It’s just crazy how things could have gone, and how everything that could have gone wrong, has gone wrong up to this point. Obviously there are going to be question marks; you’re at Man United, there are always going to be question marks over you. It was the same as a player.",
      "\"Every transfer window, you know, you’re looking over your shoulder and thinking ‘they’re signing another centre-half’ – even though you’ve just had 15 clean sheets on the bounce.",
      "\"But you’re at Man United, so that kind of thing comes with the territory. Let’s just give him time and see where we’re at come, say, March.",
      "\"Now they’re out of the League Cup, they’ve only got the FA Cup and the Premier League, so it’ll be interesting to see Amorim’s team selection for the cup when it comes around in the new year, and how strong he goes.\"",
      "United will return from the international break against Manchester City at the Etihad.",

      "With the season now four games old, Manchester United would have been hopeful that their new £73million forward would have found the back of the net by now.",
      "United fought off strong interest from Newcastle United in the Slovenia international over the summer to prise him from RB Leipzig to complete a new look front three alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But while Cunha and Mbeumo, who both have years of Premier League experience under their belt, have wasted little time in making an impression at Old Trafford, Sesko has made little impact so far.",
      "That, of course, can be heavily caveated by the fact he is yet to start in the Premier League and has accumulated just 80 minutes of action across United's opening three league games.",
      "Amorim was keen to stress he wanted Sesko to fully acclimatise to a new country and a new league before huge pressure was put on United's new goal hope but question marks were raised about the one match he has started.",
      "Sesko played the full 90 minutes as United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby last week and he was heavily criticised for being the last outfield player to take a penalty in the shootout.",
      "The fact United's marquee centre-forward was the 10th penalty taker and did not take the responsibility of taking a kick before the likes of defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire did not sit well among some observers.",
      "Some even saw it as a major red flag, despite is being so early into his time at the club.",
      "Sesko, by his own admission, has taken time to adapt and admitted in an interview in Slovenia this week that the level is higher than he has been used to in recent years.",
      "“The level of the matches is certainly much higher, the players and teammates are also at a higher level. After all, English football is at the highest level in the world of football,” Sesko told Ekipa.",
      "“But I am very much looking forward to the coming period, also because I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day.",
      "\"I wanted to move to England and, fortunately, my wish came true.”",
      "And that 'coming period' starts this evening as Sesko will line up for Slovenia in their opening World Cup qualifier against Sweden at home.",
      "Slovenia then take on Switzerland at Basel's St Jakob Park on Monday and United fans will hope to get a glimpse of why they were so inclined to pay so much money for the 22-year-old.",
      "Sesko scored 21 goals in all competitions at club level last season to establish himself as one of the hottest young strikers in European football.",
      "Tonight could the first time he sends a timely reminder of those talents since becoming a United player last month.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo had a complicated six to seven days. He went directly to Ruben Amorim and the club together with his agent to say he’s not happy.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo loves Manchester United, he’s really happy at Manchester United but he’s not happy about the game-time and Man United don’t have European football.",
      "This is why he asked to go out on loan, he never asked to leave on a permanent. It was a priority for Mainoo to go on loan but Man United said no.",
      "Internally, also with Sir Jim Ratcliffe involved, this was the decision made with all of the people involved. We cannot let Kobbie Mainoo go.",
      "I think there will be some interesting months ahead because if Kobbie Mainoo plays, the situation will be okay. But if Kobbie Mainoo stays on the bench, I think in January this could be a topic again. Now, the pitch has the final say on the future of Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "Sporting CP star Morten Hjulmand has firmly dismissed Manchester United transfer rumours when speaking to at Denmark's national team training camp, via Ojogo.",
      "They’re talking about rumours, but I don’t identify with them. I identify with the fact that I should start [preseason] at Sporting and get back in shape after the holidays.",
      "We had some very good games, in which we played at a good level, even though we lost at the weekend in a derby against FC Porto. We’re not in first place right now, and we want to get back there.",
      "The international break is often a time for fans to watch their respective clubs transfer targets in action. However, those of a Manchester United persuasion will not see Adam Wharton play any minutes.",
      "That is because he picked up an injury during Crystal Palace's 3-0 win against Aston Villa on Sunday evening. It was later confirmed the following day that he had pulled out of the England squad and was being replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek.",
      "An update on his adductor injury has since come to light with Bobby Manzi claiming he will miss the next three weeks. That likely means he will be absent for Premier League games against Sunderland and West Ham United alongside a Carabao Cup round three tie with Milwall.",
      "Andre Onana could yet depart Old Trafford over the next few weeks with interest from Turkiye in what now looks to be Manchester United's third choice goalkeeper.",
      "That is because Senne Lammens has joined the club and as Altay Bayindir had been played in the Premier League games. There is still a chance for Onana to escape United however, with windows in Turkiye and Saudi Arabia still open.",
      "With exactly that in mind, according to Hasan Tuncel, via 61 saat, Trabzonspor have contacted United over a potential loan deal for Onana. He has also been offered to clubs in the Middle East",

      "O'Neil stabilised matters at Bournemouth for a campaign following Scott Parker's dismissal after a humiliating 9-0 thrashing by Liverpool in August 2022. However, when the Cherries chose to bring in Andoni Iraola rather than retain O'Neil at the conclusion of the 2022/23 season, the Englishman moved to Wolves.",
      "Throughout his debut term in the West Midlands, Wolves secured 14th place despite temporarily rising to eighth. He was touted as a successor to Gareth Southgate with England and was similarly endorsed for the role at Old Trafford.",

Journalist Duncan Castles revealed on The Transfers Podcast that Semenyo was aggressively targeted by United in the summer window , with a £55 million deal on the cards. However, the player reportedly in the end opted to sign a new deal with his current club.",
      "The forward has gone on to score three times in the first three Premier League games this season, including a brace in the season opener against Liverpool.",
      "His addition would have added further to United’s attack, alongside the summer arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with Ruben Amorim having plenty of options to choose from. With Semenyo also able to play a central role, his addition may have meant that Chido Obi would have been allowed to go out on loan in search of more game time.",
      "It’s not just attack where United were looking to add players this summer. The club also targeted Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, but came up against a firm not for sale stance from the Eagles.",

      "If both players completed a move to Old Trafford, it would have allowed United to grant Kobbie Mainoo’s wish of going out on loan. The midfielder stayed at United beyond the deadline despite asking to move away on a temporary deal.",
      "The third area that United could have strengthened more is the goalkeeping department. The club did complete the deadline day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, but the step up to first choice at Old Trafford could be difficult.",
      "The signing of Emi Martinez, who was heavily linked with a move to United in the final days of the window would have likely seen him go in as first choice. That would have allowed United to move Andre Onana on, with them having confidence with the options they have.",

      "Jamie Carragher has slammed one thing he \"can't stand\" following Alejandro Garnacho's switch from Manchester United to Chelsea.",
      "However, it's got nothing to do with the winger's footballing talent or how his transfer was handled. Rather, it's Garnacho's behaviour since arriving at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Following confirmation of his £40million move, the Argentina international made his way to west London but was restricted to watching the Blues' clash with Fulham from the stands.",
      "The 21-year-old penned a seven-year deal with Chelsea, whilst United have negotiated a 10 per cent sell-on clause as part of their agreement. The transfer was completed too late for Garnacho to feature against the Cottagers though.",
      "And barely eight minutes had passed when Garnacho was caught red-handed by television cameras. Sky's footage showed the youngster browsing his mobile phone instead of focusing on the action unfolding before him.",
      "Carragher, alongside Roy Keane, were asked to assess some of the Premier League's most significant summer signings. That incident during the Fulham fixture influenced Carragher's verdict, reports the Mirror.",
      "\"You know what I didn't like?\" Carragher said. \"Did you see the game [against Fulham], when they go to the people in the stands and they are on their phones with the game going on?",
      "\"I can't stand it. And it's not just him by the way, but I can't stand it. So it's a miss for that. For sitting on his phone during an important game for Chelsea.\" Keane offered his thoughts on the transfer and said: \"I'm undecided on that one. I'm not convinced.\"",
      "Garnacho's Chelsea debut could arrive against the Blues' other west London rivals in Brentford following the international break. The former United star will be required to demonstrate his fitness after being separated from Ruben Amorim's first team throughout the summer.",
      "The winger was amongst a group that featured Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony who were forbidden from training alongside their team-mates whilst seeking transfers.",
      "Garnacho is eagerly anticipating integrating with his new squad though. \"It's an incredible moment for my family and I to join this great club. I can't wait to get started,\" he said.",
      "\"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special – we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\" Should Garnacho make his Blues debut at the Gtech Community Stadium on September 13th, it would mark the club's fourth consecutive league match in London.",
      "They finally travel outside of the nation's capital a week later as they take on Manchester United in what will be the winger's first visit back to Old Trafford since leaving.",

      "Even though the summer transfer window is closed for Manchester United, there is still the potential for more deals to be completed.",
      "A total of five new signings were made by United during the summer window, with Diego Leon's arrival being agreed earlier in the year. United also went on to bring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens to Old Trafford before the deadline.",
      "United also saw some members of their squad leave the club during the summer window. Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford (loan), Antony, Jadon Sancho (loan), Christian Eriksen (free transfer) and Rasmus Hojlund (loan with buy obligation) were among the players to leave United before the transfer window closed.",
      "United will have to wait until January to make any more signings, but it's possible that some members of the squad could still leave in the next few days. This is due to transfer windows in other countries remaining open.",
      "For instance, the transfer window in Turkey remains open for another week and does not close until September 12. This gives the potential for more players to leave United before they return to Premier League action after the international break.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was heavily linked with a move away from United this summer and did inform the club of his desire to leave Old Trafford. There have also been plenty of rumours about Andre Onana's future at United after the club decided to sign Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "It remains to be seen what United will have planned over the next week and if clubs from Turkey will express an interest in any of their players.",

      "Manchester United submitted a deal sheet to complete the signing of Senne Lammens.",
      "The summer transfer window closed at 7pm on Monday for Premier League clubs, but an extra two hours were granted to the sides who sumbitted a deal sheet to complete late deals.",
      "United sources confirmed everything was on track to sign Lammens, despite the deadline passing. The club formally announced the transfer at 10pm and fans were relieved to see a goalkeeper come in.",
      "Royal Antwerp needed to cash in on Lammens due to their financial situation. United agreed a deal of £18.2million, plus add-ons, to land the goalkeeper and he signed a five-year contract.",
      "Lammens said: \"I am extremely proud to be joining Manchester United, it is a real dream come true. The past few years have been an amazing journey, it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special.",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my teammates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.”",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: “Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential; we are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.”",
      "The conversation about where Lammens fits into the goalkeeper pecking order began before his official arrival, as he has a huge opportunity to claim first-choice status at Old Trafford.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started the season as the first choice and made mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. Andre Onana was recalled to the starting team against Grimsby and he was at fault for their second goal.",
      "Ruben Amorim has a dilemma over which goalkeeper starts against Manchester City after the international break. Will he throw Lammens into the deep end? Will he persist with Bayindir? Could Onana return?",
      "All three goalkeeper options will be considered, but they're all imperfect. Lammens is unproven in the Premier League and starting him in the Manchester derby, one of the most watched and scrutinised games of the season, could potentially set him up to fail after only just signing for the club.",
      "If Lammens disappointed on his debut against City, he would face an uphill battle from the start of his United career, so Amorim might want to protect him with a long-term view in mind.",
      "On the other hand, the dream start for any new United signing is to perform well in the Manchester derby, and perhaps Lammens will be able to shrug off the pressure to sparkle at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim must decide whether Lammens will be able to cut it straight away. The bar is low for Lammens to impress considering how poor Bayindir and Onana have been and it will be difficult for him to be worse.",
      "Still, there is obviously an element of risk with Lammens and Amorim knows what to expect with Bayindir and Onana, which might be enough to tip the scales in favour of the pair.",
      "United have three senior goalkeepers - excluding Tom Heaton - battling for one place in the team, raising the possibility of either Onana or Bayindir being sold to a league whose window is still open (Saudi Arabia and Turkey).",
      "Amorim's selection for the opening games of the season suggests Bayindir will start against City if Lammens is overlooked. Onana has been demoted since returning from injury and seems to have lost Amorim's trust.",
      "If it's a choice between Bayindir and Lammens, the latter should get the nod for the derby.",

      "Newcastle pushed hard to sign Sesko and had Champions League football to offer, but the young striker preferred a move to Old Trafford this summer and signed a five-year contract.",

      "The 22-year-old has not scored since signing from RB Leipzig, but he is still getting up to speed after missing time in pre-season.",
      "Sesko has reported for international duty with Slovenia and he spoke to local press about his start at United.",
      "“The level of the matches is certainly much higher, the players and teammates are also at a higher level. After all, English football is at the highest level in the world of football,” Sesko told Ekipa.",
      "“But I am very much looking forward to the coming period, also because I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day.",
      "\"I wanted to move to England and, fortunately, my wish came true.”",
      "Sesko spoke about the Manchester derby, adding: “It’s true, it’s an incredibly big match coming up. There will simply be some pressure on both sides to just win this match. There’s still quite a bit to go until this match, but we’re definitely looking forward to a top-notch match.”",
      "Speaking after the win over Burnley, Amorim explained his decision not to bring Sesko on earlier against Scott Parker's side.",
      "\"So he finished the [Grimsby] game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties,\" explained Amorim",
      "\"And today was that reason also, because (Joshua) Zirkzee is also a striker, he's an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a division four team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.",
      "\"With the problem with Mason Mount (injury), I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes. So everything was connected. The penalty, the game on Wednesday, and the number of minutes that I was thinking to put Ben today.\"",

      "Daniel Levy has stepped down as Tottenham's executive chairman, and legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's admission encapsulates what a hard nut he was to crack.",
      "Levy, who joined the Spurs board in December 2000, has been the driving force behind the north London club's transition from White Hart Lane to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He now steps down after almost 25 years without any alterations to his ownership or shares in the club.",
      "This follows closely on the heels of Vinai Venkatesham's appointment as chief executive officer, while Peter Charrrington has joined the board and assumed the role of non-executive chairman, in what is being portrayed as a move prioritising sporting success.",
      "During his tenure with Spurs, Levy was known for his hardball approach to transfers, earning a reputation as a savvy negotiator with a knack for striking a deal.",
      "However, these tactics irked iconic United manager Ferguson when the two clubs were pitted against each other in negotiations over Dimitar Berbatov 17 years ago.",
      "Berbatov eventually completed a move from White Hart Lane to Old Trafford for £30million, although the acrimonious aftermath saw Tottenham lodge a complaint with the Premier League over the transfer. Subsequently, Ferguson was less than flattering when reflecting on the negotiations.",
      "\"That whole experience was more painful than my hip replacement,\" he wrote in his book, Leading, highlighting the challenging nature of dealing with Levy and indirectly praising his negotiation skills.",
      "Upon the announcement of his departure, Levy issued a heartfelt statement: \"I am incredibly proud of the work I have done together with the executive team and all our employees.",
      "\"We have built this club into a global heavyweight competing at the highest level. More than that, we have built a community,\" he added.",
      "\"I was fortunate enough to work with some of the greatest people in this sport, from the team at Lilywhite House and Hotspur Way to all the players and managers over the years.",
      "\"I wish to thank all the fans that have supported me over the years. It hasn't always been an easy journey but significant progress has been made. I will continue to support this club passionately.\"",
      "Berbatov was Ferguson's record buy and enjoyed a successful four years under the Scot's management. He registered 56 goals and 27 assists in 149 games for the Red Devils.",
      "He departed for Fulham in 2012 with a considerably bolstered silverware collection. He'd picked up medals for two Premier League triumphs, two League Cups, two Community Shields and a Club World Cup.",

      "Michael Owen admits he was “embarrassed” by his performance levels at Manchester United compared to his prime years.",
      "The former England striker opened up to former Red Devils team-mate Rio Ferdinand on the Rio Presents podcast about struggling mentally with his decline during the second half of his career, which he admitted was “killing him inside”.",
      "Owen exploded onto the Premier League stage as a 17-year-old at Liverpool, swiftly making his mark with his blistering pace behind defences and ruthless finishing. He claimed the division's golden boot prize in his first two full seasons before making his mark on the international stage with a stunning strike against Argentina aged 18 at the World Cup 1998.",
      "Following his crucial contribution to Liverpool's historic Treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup in 2001, which saw him claim the Ballon d'Or, he secured a transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2004.",
      "Owen played in La Liga for just one season before his £16.8million move to Newcastle, where recurring muscular injuries meant he was absent for extended spells over the next four campaigns in the North East. His fitness woes persisted at Manchester United and later Stoke City, with the forward deciding to hang up his boots in 2013.",
      "The 45-year-old was recently asked by Ferdinand about the drop off from going from an elite environment to one that isn’t. But Owen instead chose to reflect on his own career, explaining that he sees it in two distinct halves: before and after his injury problems.",
      "Owen said: “Well, I've said before, I mean, I sort of split my career into two. Almost Liverpool and maybe Madrid. And then afterwards, because I just wasn't the same. Not that I didn't like it. I loved it at United. I love you and the lads and whatever.",
      "“But I'm not me. I'm not me. You know what I was when I was 18. And you know what I was when I was 30. It's like, I was half embarrassed. I'm coming out, they've been to these big stadiums, St James' Park, Old Trafford, with my name on my back.",
      "“It's like, can I not just change my name and just think of something, like call me something else? I don't want people to remember me like this. Still good, still scoring. But I'm not what I was. It's killing me. But it's like, what can you do?”",
      "During his time at Liverpool, Owen scored more than 20 goals in all competitions in every season except two. After netting 16 times in 45 appearances for Real Madrid, his numbers plummeted dramatically as injuries piled up and his once lightning-fast pace began to wane.",
      "Reflecting on his time at Newcastle, Man United and Stoke, he openly admitted: “I had it for eight years, when I'm thinking, ‘I don't like this.’ I was looking at the clock half of my career, thinking only 20 minutes. And I could still score. I could still play well.",
      "“I couldn't rip a team's heart out anymore. I could just finish if I get the opportunity. I'm relying on everyone else now. Whereas I used to be able to, I didn't need anyone else. Just give me the ball and I'll do it. And that change of mentality.",
      "“I didn't retire because of my body. I still played in a game the other day. I retired because my mind was about to explode. And I couldn't have it anymore that I was just a Premier League player.”",
      "Despite not living up to his own high standards, Owen's stint at Manchester United saw him finally win the Premier League trophy in the 2010/11 season, as well as another League Cup. He ended his career with an impressive tally of 222 goals in 482 matches, along with 40 goals in 89 England caps.",

United have taken losses on almost every one of those players, but will at least be pleased to get them off their wage bill after spending heavily this summer.",
      "Reds boss Ruben Amorim will hope that his squad have no further distractions now that the transfer deadline has passed. His team can focus fully on playing football with their futures settled until at least January.",
      "There is still one player, though, who remains stuck at M16 after asking to leave. United full-back Tyrell Malacia will still be training at Carrington having failed to secure a move before Monday's deadline across most of Europe.",
      "However, the Dutchman still has opportunities to depart. The window in Turkey - for example - remains open until September 12. There has been a spate of sales to Turkey from the Premier League in recent times and the prospect remains for Malacia to join a team in the Turkish Super Lig.",
      "The window in Saudi Arabia is another with plenty of days left to run, closing on September 23. Other potential opportunities for Malacia include Belgium, Switzerland (both September 8), Greece (September 12) and Serbia (September 17).",

      "Former Arsenal star Theo Walcott has branded Manchester United icon Peter Schmeichel as \"sour\" for his damning comments on Arsenal's style of play in their defeat to Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side registered just one shot on target at Anfield last weekend as a stunning late Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick secured the three points for Arne Slot's reigning champions. Afterwards, the former United keeper, who has hit out at the Gunners previously, slammed Arsenal for playing an \"ugly brand of football\" with their risk-averse approach rattling some pundits.",
      "Walcott, who represented the Gunners from 2005-2018, claimed Arteta's conservative approach against Liverpool had actually worked in Arsenal's opening weekend encounter against Manchester United, where the Gunners won 1-0.",
      "Schmeichel's swipe was actually a result of sour grapes after United had lost that encounter against their rivals, in the eyes of Walcott.",
      "\"Well, it worked at Man United so maybe Schmeichel is a bit sour from that result,\" Walcott said referring to Arsenal's style of play on the It's Called Soccer! podcast. \"Because there are times when it works. But the plan in those games is to stay in the game and this is the dynamic, and where I feel Mikel Arteta is at this moment in time.\"",
      "Referring to the lucrative backing Arteta has had in the transfer market this summer, Walcott added: \"He's now equipped, the club have really backed him with investment and now he's got options everywhere but he likes to go back to his [mantra] of, 'We need to stay in the game.'",
      "\"I've played with managers, Arsene [Wenger] at times, when you're in the games and you're like, 'Just bring on another forward as this is where you can score more goals.'",
      "\"Managers are too afraid of losing and this is the problem, because now he's lost, everyone is going to look at this way and say, 'Well they lost, they weren't adventurous and playing with that freedom.' But it was working up to a certain point.\"",
      "Arsenal were missing Bukayo Saka, while captain Martin Odegaard was only fit enough for the bench. However, a reliance on set-pieces and corners saw Arsenal lag behind in possession and xG stakes against Liverpool, and Schmeichel was left angered by their approach to the game.",
      "\"I have never in my life ever wanted a team to win a game of football more than Liverpool today. Arsenal bring an ugly brand of football to our game,\" he said on Viaplay following Liverpool's 1-0 victory. \"I don't want to insult Arsenal but their brand of football is so annoying to watch, it's designed to exploit opponents while waiting for set pieces.\"",
      "Arsenal have been regarded as set piece specialists for well over a year, and that has helped them win several high-profile games. However, on multiple occasions they've been criticised for being unable to unlock teams with a brand of football that's pleasing on the eye.",
      "\"They've seen this before. They look comfortable in a big game, but at this moment in time haven't got that risk in their game, that courage to go and think they can win.\"",

      "Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott believes Ruben Amorim will have departed Manchester United before Christmas arrives.",
      "The Red Devils kicked off the new campaign with promise, despite suffering a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal. This loss showed character, and bolstered by new signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, the future appeared encouraging.",
      "A 1-1 stalemate with Fulham quickly dampened such optimism, while a Carabao Cup elimination by League Two outfit Grimsby Town marked a fresh nadir. A dramatic 3-2 triumph over Burnley ensued, though the victory lacked conviction, with an injury to newcomer Cunha serving as another blemish on a season still in its early stages.",
      "The penalty shootout defeat to a lower-league opponent sparked demands for the manager's dismissal. While such calls have slightly subsided, Lescott remains convinced that United will have appointed a new boss by January.",
      "Following the international interval, a challenging visit to the Etihad to face rivals City awaits Amorim. Pep Guardiola's team have also endured a stuttering start to the campaign, with Lescott maintaining both managers face mounting scrutiny, reports the Mirror.",
      "\"The pressure is on for both managers [Amorim and Guardiola],\" declared Lescott on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"Different types of pressure, though.",
      "ALL OUT FOOTBALL ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Follow All Out Football on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X.",
      "\"Pep's job isn't under threat, but Amorim's is, yeah,\" continued Lescott. \"I'd be very surprised if he (Amorim) is still there by Christmas. If he is there in January 2026, they're just being stubborn. He looks lost.\"",
      "Lescott, who played at the Etihad between 2009 and 2014 and made 160 appearances, additionally believes that Amorim's Manchester rival, Guardiola, has seen his City departure telegraphed through fresh signings.",
      "When questioned whether City are planning for existence beyond Guardiola, Lescott replied: \"Yeah, maybe. You're going to have to. The standards may be different this season because it's a new era, you know.",
      "\"When you've got seasoned players who have been there for an extended period, they are the ones who guide you through difficult times. Whilst now, there's [Tijjani] Reijnders, [Rayan] Cherki. They're all experiencing negativity together for the first time. So who is going to get them out of it?",
      "\"I think, like prior to Pep, a lot of this summer's signings are post-Pep. Just like when they signed Kevin [De Bruyne], Delphy [Fabian Delph], Raheem [Sterling], they all signed before Pep arrived, but they were for Pep.\"",
      "Guardiola, who extended his tenure at Manchester City last year with a contract set to expire in 2027, told ESPN: \"After my contract with City, I'm going to stop. I'm sure. I don't know if I'm going to retire, but I'm going to take a break. How I want to be remembered, I don't know.",
      "\"All coaches want to win so we can have a memorable job, but I believe that the fans of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City had fun watching my teams play. I don't think we should ever live thinking about whether we're going to be remembered.\"",

    "body": [
      "Jeff Stelling believes that Manchester United have had a \"poor\" transfer window after failing to address two key issues.",
      "Ruben Amorim received the backing of the board this summer as he strived to improve the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag. And while spending more than £200million on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko alone may seem fruitful on the face of things, Stelling believes the club have overlooked two pivotal areas of the pitch; the team's engine room and between the sticks.",
      "\"I thought it was absolutely essential and they haven’t done so. Yes, they’ve got Kobbie Mainoo but he hasn’t got the sort of legs required to drive that midfield forward.\"",
      "Mainoo's summer at Old Trafford has a controversial one, given that the English talent hoped to leave the club on loan after failing to get the nod over Bruno Fernandes in the starting XI. However, Amorim was not keen on the idea of the 20-year-old parting ways with his squad, telling reporters last month: \"I want Kobbie to stay and he needs to fight for his place.",
      "\"We need Kobbie. That is not going to change. The players not playing with be disappointed but everyone will have opportunities. You have to fight in the week.\"",
      "Mainoo was ultimately not allowed to leave, but the Red Devils did very little to strengthen their ageing midfield. Despite being linked with Carlos Baleba for large parts of the window, Brighton's £100m price tag of the star proved too hot to handle for the time being, especially considering Amorim had splurged a large portion of the club's kitty on a new attacking line.",
      "However, Stelling also criticised the club's choice to invest in 23-year-old goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, who joined United in an £18.2m move from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. While the Red Devils were linked with an unsettled Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa, they ultimately opted on Lammens, who is nine years the Argentine's junior and proves as a far cheaper option on the face of things.",
      "While he brings the benefit of youth to Amorim's squad, he lacks the vital Premier League experience that 32-year-old Martinez holds, given that he has impressed for Villa over the past five years and also has experience with Arsenal. And it's something that Stelling believes may have been incredibly beneficial going forward.",
      "He added: \"And, they’ve gone for the cheap goalkeeper option. Lammens might turn out to be a fantastic goalkeeper but it's a humungous step for him to go from playing for Royal Antwerp in front of 12,00 people in the Belgian league to huge crowds at Old Trafford. For me, Emi Martinez was the obvious choice for Manchester United.\"",
      "While Amorim insisted that he was happy with his goalkeeping set-up earlier in the window, the Portuguese tactician has seemingly since noticed holes in the games of both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "Bayindir has featured in each of United's three Premier League games this season thus far, and came under fire for the Red Devils' 1-0 opening day loss to Arsenal. The 27-year-old botched a clearance from a corner, which allowed Riccardo Calafiori to sneak in at the back post and score the game-winning goal.",
      "Meanwhile, Onana was deployed during United's Carabao Club clash with Grimsby Town last month, where he was also lambasted for errors which led to the League Two side securing a 2-0 lead by half-time. Despite goals from Mbeumo and Harry Maguire squaring the clash, they were ultimately dumped out after a tense penalty shootout.",
      "It's been a mix-bag of results in the league for United thus far, with a win, a loss and a draw to their name from their opening three, and Amorim will undoubtedly be hoping for a more inspired performance when they return from the international break for the Manchester Derby come Sunday, September 14.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Barcelona also have the option to make his transfer to Catalonia permanent for £26million next summer. The Reds academy graduate has been called up to Thomas Tuchel's England squad - for World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia in September - as the Three Lions move closer to qualifying for next summer's tournament.",

      "Tuchel shared his satisfaction when he brought Rashford back into the fold last season. The former Chelsea head coach remains committed to elevating the 27-year-old's performance by facilitating his season-long loan switch to Barcelona.",
      "Tuchel said: \"I think he had a very good camp. He tried very, very hard to be the best version of himself in the first camp. He was in a good moment in Aston Villa.",
      "\"I wanted to encourage him and give him as a positive feedback, gave him this camp and the call-up. He did very well. He missed the second camp for us. Now he made a big change, into a new football culture, new country.",

      "United's morale hit a new low when they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town, leading to calls for Amorim's dismissal. A narrow 3-2 victory against Burnley did little to quell the unrest within the club.",
      "Adding to the turmoil, Jones, who made over 200 appearances for United, has now suggested that a number of Amorim's squad are not keen on their manager, reports the Mirror.",
      "\"Do I think there were players at United who didn't like him? To be honest, that's probably a ridiculous question because I'd say there are people in the United team now who don't like the manager,\" Jones told Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction.",

      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…",
      "Ruben Amorim remains under fire at Man Utd and there are signs that the pressure is getting the better of him as the inexperienced head coach is running out of allies.",
      "A supposed transformative summer transfer window does not appear to have made much, if any, difference. There are the same problems at Man Utd, who are just as toothless in attack and easy to play through despite investing £230m on signings and ridding themselves of some deadwood.",
      "Amorim’s bullish insistence on sticking with his failing 3-4-3 formation continues to limit Man Utd, with his refusal to adapt, a la Ange Postecoglou, likely to be a key factor in his eventual downfall, which could be sooner than most expected.",
      "There is yet to be evidence of a Man Utd player performing better in Amorim’s formation than previous set-ups, with Kobbie Mainoo among the most high-profile victims of the head coach’s appointment.",
      "Mainoo has gone from legitimately being one of the best prospects in the world to a benchwarmer for a very poor Man Utd side, with Amorim a main contributor to the Premier League giants not seeing the best of the England international for many months.",
      "Man Utd supporters were glad that common sense prevailed in the final week of the transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Co. swiftly shut down Mainoo’s hopes of leaving on loan to secure regular game time ahead of next year’s World Cup, with his positive standing highlighted in a GiveMeSport article on the club’s midfield situation.",
      "The report claims ‘United have made a significant U-turn as internal discussions with Mainoo have resulted in him being increasingly confident that he can become a key part of Amorim’s plans’, while ‘there have been indications that they would be more keen to sell Bruno Fernandes’.",
      "Within a day of this revelation, a contrary report from Football Transfers claimed that Amorim was ‘left furious’ that Man Utd’s clear verdict on Mainoo prevented a late-window move for Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher.",
      "Would Gallagher have been a solid addition as a last resort? Yes, probably. But Amorim’s stance, both reported and public, does expose his carelessness regarding a Man Utd player with a higher ceiling than most in their current squad, who should be among the head coach’s main priorities.",
      "Amorim should be doing all he can to make Mainoo a vital component in his team, and it says a lot about the head coach’s position that club chiefs appear to have given Mainoo such a level of internal backing.",
      "Integrating Mainoo would be made easier had they cashed in on Fernandes when £100m from the Saudi Pro League was on the table in the summer, with Man Utd’s ‘willingness to sell’ (as per GiveMeSport) suggesting they already regret doing what they could to retain their club captain’s services instead of ushering him to the exit door.",
      "There’s no doubting Fernandes’ quality and he was easily Man Utd’s best player last season, but his early-season struggles from a deeper position has made it clear that the club’s decision not to maximise his value and use the profit to make the game-changing signing of a top-tier No.6 (E.g. Carlos Baleba) was a huge mistake that will hold them back for at least another year.",
      "READ NEXT: If Mainoo ‘doesn’t like’ Amorim who can blame him? Man Utd boss is clearly ‘the problem’",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s decision on Kobbie Mainoo after he looked to leave Manchester United last month.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has every right to “not like” Ruben Amorim as the Man Utd manager is very clearly “the problem” in his case.",
      "Amorim may well look at the fate that’s befallen five of his six Manchester United predecessors this summer and think twice about resigning.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted to bring in Conor Gallagher before the transfer window shut but the Man Utd board insisted on keeping Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It’s claimed Amorim will be sacked if he doesn’t get into Europe, but he should also be wary of ‘bored players’ and a vibes-based ethos at Man Utd.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is safe for now but the Red Devils have decided what would ‘prove fatal’ for the head coach this season, according to reports."

      "How good is Senne Lammens?",
      "The stats suggest the new Manchester United goalkeeper knows his way around a six-yard box. And the YouTube compilations will tell you whatever you want to be told.",
      "So the short answer: f*** knows.",
      "Unless you’re an avid watcher of the Jupiler Pro League, then you will know as little as we do. And it’s ok to admit that you’ve never seen Lammens play and that until quite recently, you had never heard of the 23-year-old.",
      "There may come a day very soon that you will long for those times of blissful ignorance. Because Lammens is set to have every catch, kick, fumble and twitch scrutinised from every angle when he assumes responsibility for the ‘hardest job in football’.",
      "When he takes his place in the Old Trafford goal, United fans just need to hope that the recruitment figures at Old Trafford have thoroughly done their homework on Lammens. And that they have finally learned how to pick a goalkeeper.",
      "United will have seen the same stats we have – and reams more – that suggest Lammens is a very good goalkeeper indeed. In the Belgian Pro League.",
      "Last season, for Royal Antwerp, he conceded 32 goals, whereas xG tells us he ought to have been beaten 44.5 times. Not accounting for two own goals – one of which was scored by Lammens himself – the numbers suggest he conceded 0.5 goals per game fewer than expected.",
      "In that metric, he is unmatched in Europe’s top five leagues. None of which he was playing in, of course. But even accounting for the level, it’s a very impressive claim.",
      "He made a few of those last season. Lammens stopped 11.2% of the crosses swung into Antwerp’s box. Only six keepers in the top five European leagues were more effective. For comparison, Andre Onana stopped 5.4% of the crosses in his vicinity – half the number Lammens managed in two more matches.",
      "The stats paint a picture of a very competent goalkeeper, a ‘strong all-rounder’ as Lammens described himself this week, and that would make a very welcome change for United fans, their nerves frayed by watching Onana shamble around their goal for two seasons. And when he was finally replaced, in came Altay Bayindir, who seemingly reached the highest level having never had to face a corner-kick before.",
      "United, hopefully – we make no assumptions of them these days – have dug a little deeper on Lammens, though. Because nothing on a spreadsheet can tell them or us how the 23-year-old will cope with the step up and the spotlight about to shine upon him.",
      "In that respect, United’s decision to opt for Lammens over Emiliano Martinez remains a surprise. Martinez, outwardly, possesses more confidence than is healthy for a functioning adult in society, but an ideal level of self-belief for an elite goalkeeper. United’s keeper concerns down the years have generally been solved by experience and the simple answer to their current problems would have been someone with Martinez’s CV and presence.",
      "No question, this is a gamble for United. Going for a much younger, inexperienced, unproven option carries huge risk for the reward of a stable presence in their nets.",
      "Even if that’s what Lammens proves to be in the long term, things will almost certainly get dicey in the meantime.",
      "David De Gea was younger and had to grow into his United shirt – literally and metaphorically – when he arrived in 2012, but Sir Alex Ferguson saw something worth persevering with during a rotten 18 months at the start of his career at Old Trafford.",
      "Would De Gea have been afforded that settling-in period in today’s climate? Very unlikely. He was fortunate to be part of a very fine team while being shielded by the sheer force of Fergie. Lammens will enjoy the benefit of neither of those things, or anything even close.",
      "When he makes mistakes – he will because all goalkeepers do; the best just keep them to an absolute minimum – Lammens will be ridiculed, mocked and written off by a wider public that never tires of rejoicing in the Red Devils’ misery.",
      "But in between the inevitable misjudgements, if he can rise above the pathetically low bar the current keepers have set, then United have to show more resolve than we suspect they possess while allowing Lammens the necessary time to develop into the keeper they apparently feel he can become.",
      "According to reports, Daniel Levy has an excuse for the main reason behind his exit from Tottenham Hotspur amid a ‘deliberate move’ by the club’s owners.",
      "There’s a surprising amount of love for Daniel Levy after his departure from Tottenham.",
      "Including two Arsenal gems and a new Liverpool signing, we’ve ranked the 20 best Premier League players under the age of 21.",

      "We’ve ranked the 20 best Premier League players under the age of 21, as of September 4. Trust us, it wasn’t easy.",
      "The sheer volume of young talent in the league is outrageous. At one point we considered limiting it to teenagers, but that wasn’t the plan. Still, whittling it down to just 20 has been a migraine-inducing task, and some brilliant prospects have inevitably been left out.",
      "Our first draft was ridiculous; 39 names made the cut initially. Back then, Burnley, Wolves, Leeds United, Aston Villa, and Nottingham Forest were the only clubs without a representative. By the time we trimmed the list down, Bournemouth, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Sunderland joined them among the Premier League’s youth-neglecting b**tards.",
      "Since we dropped nearly as many players as we kept, we’ll throw in honourable mentions right up until first place (in no particular order). Just to give ourselves extra work. But everything we do, we do it for you.",
      "It’s tough to avoid a so-called ‘Big Six’ bias with lists like this. The best teams usually have the best players: young, prime, or old. That doesn’t mean every talented youngster starts at a big club, but the food chain tends to funnel them there sooner or later.",
      "This is a combination of the best players ranked in terms of ability, but it’s also a bit of a ‘players to watch’ feature. Talent-wise, you might argue that Rio Ngumoha and Max Dowman are shoo-ins, but we’re not convinced they’ll actually start a league game in 2025/26. There’s no need for those two to be added as honourable mentions then. Lovely.",
      "",
      "Signed from Slavia Prague for £19million this summer, Diouf has played every minute for West Ham so far this season. He’s registered an assist in each of his last two appearances, helping the Hammers earn their first win of 2025/26 at Nottingham Forest on matchday three.",
      "Honourable mention: Oliver Scarles (West Ham United)",
      "",
      "From one wing-back to another, we’ve seen Diouf play in a back four already, but every time Dorgu has started for United, it’s been in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. After costing around £25m, there are high expectations for the 20-year-old. We’re yet to be convinced, but he does seem well-suited to the wing-back role. It’s hard to judge any player while playing in Amorim’s dysfunctional system, to be fair.",
      "Honourable mention: Chido Obi (Manchester United)",
      "",
      "Brighton completed the signing of Tzimas in February, allowing the striker to stay at FC Nuremberg in Bundesliga 2 for the rest of 2024/25. He scored 12 goals in 24 league appearances last term and made a significant impact on his Albion debut, registering two goals and one assist in 24 minutes off the bench at Oxford United in a 6-0 Carabao Cup second round win.",
      "Honourable mention: Charalampos Kostoulas (Brighton & Hove Albion)",
      "",
      "Injuries curtailed Odobert’s debut season in north London, but he’s come off the bench in three out of three league games this term. The Frenchman is an exciting winger, as shown in his first few appearances under Ange Postecoglou. After improving Kevin Schade’s game at Brentford, you’d back Thomas Frank to get Odobert flying. Not literally, obviously.",
      "Honourable mention: Ben Gannon Doak (AFC Bournemouth)",
      "MORE FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Why the five post-Fergie Man Utd managers before Amorim were sacked\n👉 Are we seeing the return of the big man up top? Giants incoming this summer…\n👉 Chiesa has Liverpool fans, a goal and Rio Ngumoha to blame for second huge mistake",
      "",
      "Chelsea have a top talent in versatile defender Acheampong, yet without an injury to Levi Colwill, he’d have likely been sold in the summer transfer window. The 19-year-old can play right-back, left-back and centre-back, and started on matchday one against Crystal Palace, helping the Blues keep a clean sheet. He’s been an unused substitute in the other two fixtures, and even with Colwill out for the best part of a year, we fear for his game time across the campaign.",
      "Honourable mention: Tyrique George (Chelsea)",
      "",
      "Leoni’s chances of playing this season are higher after Liverpool failed to capture Marc Guehi. Possibly the only person to benefit from that transfer falling through, the young Italian will be waiting for Ibrahima Konate’s inevitable injury to take his chance.",
      "Honourable mention: Alex Jimenez (AFC Bournemouth)",
      "",
      "We’ve already seen a lot of young Hinshelwood; 52 times in the Premier League, to be exact. The 20-year-old is naturally a defensive midfielder, but has played a lot of his senior football in defence. His versatility is astonishing, starting up front and scoring a brace against Spurs on the final day of last season. Hinshelwood has seven goal involvements in his last 13 top-flight appearances.

      "A record spend was made by Premier League clubs this summer, yet many still have maddeningly-obvious holes in their squad.",
      "Manchester United may or may not have filled the one in their goal with the signing of Senne Lammens. Since the vast majority of us know next to nothing of the young goalkeeper bought from Royal Antwerp, only time will tell. Just as likely as Lammens being the competent stopper United need is the prospect of him being eaten alive while jumping from comparative obscurity into the hardest position in football right now.",
      "United moved at glacial pace to recruit in one of the positions that anyone with functioning eyes could see they had to. In the other, the Red Devils had a sniff and thought they can make do.",
      "Apparently, United believe they have ‘strong and versatile’ options to play in Ruben Amorim’s midfield. We doubt the manager agrees with whoever watched United over the last year before reaching that conclusion.",
      "There is not so much a hole in Amorim’s engine room as an asteroid-sized crater. One that could ultimately cost Amorim his job if European qualification really is a non-negotiable target this season.",
      "If United and Amorim fall short, then the manager’s dogmatic belief in his one and only system looks likely to be the primary reason. And without a deep-lying midfielder who can destroy and dictate, Amorim is almost being set up to fail.",
      "That they were so keen on Carlos Baleba suggests there are important people at United who haven’t missed the bleeding obvious. Brighton’s valuation made United cower so far into submission that they appeared scared to consider the possibility that Baleba might not be the only No.6 on earth.",
      "Already, with the window still shaking from being SLAMMED SHUT, there is talk of renewed interest in Baleba and other midfielders next summer. Have United missed their best opportunity to land Baleba? If he shows the form he’s widely thought to be capable of this season, Brighton will be looking for another record fee, by which time the £100million they wanted last month will seem cheap. And United might not have the free run they could have enjoyed this summer.",
      "Regardless, Amorim cannot afford to think so far ahead. Right now, he appears to be living game-to-game, even if the United hierarchy are said to have no plans – yet – to rip up their latest plan. Though if he goes, it is just as likely that it won’t be the club’s decision.",
      "With United’s forward line completely and expensively remodelled and a goalkeeper who isn’t Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir, Amorim’s overwhelming priority now is to make do and mend his midfield hole.",
      "The chasm lies next to Bruno Fernandes. The captain’s suitability to a central midfield role is a debate for another time, but his more permanent shift into a deeper position makes it more imperative that any partner has legs.",
      "Casemiro had legs for days; pins among the best in Europe. But those days have passed.",
      "Amorim, probably correctly, says Kobbie Mainoo is an alternative to Fernandes, not a foil.",
      "Which leaves one possible option: Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ugarte was bought last summer for this exact job. United sacrificed Scott McTominay to add some Uruguayan bite into Erik ten Hag’s midfield. A year on, Ten Hag has been sacked twice; McTominay is the King of Naples; and Ugarte looks further than ever from filling his brief.",
      "We should make allowances for any midfielder coming into the hustle and bustle of the Premier League from Ligue 1 and, prior to that, the Portuguese league. Ugarte was 23 when United paid £42million up front to pluck him from PSG – perhaps their gratitude ought to have raised our suspicions – and there is a long list of stars who took time to adjust before ultimately thriving in Our League.",
      "If United did not see their midfield as a priority this summer, increased expectations of Ugarte must have prompted that judgement. Which makes his start to the season all the more concerning.",
      "Overlooked for Casemiro, Ugarte came off the bench midway through the second halves of the defeat to Arsenal and draw at Fulham. Not coincidentally just as whatever control United had gained in either game began to slip.",
      "He started in the Carabao Cup. Ugarte certainly wasn’t alone in stinking out Grimsby but he was one of three hooked at half-time while Amorim’s patience dangled by a thinning thread. Struggling to keep up with the pace in your first season in the Premier League is understandable. Being miles off it against League Two opposition is infinitely more damning.",
      "So poor were those 91 combined minutes that hopes for Ugarte being the answer to Amorim’s problems are slimmer than ever. Which is even more peculiar when you consider that no United player should be more familiar with the manager’s expectations.",
      "Ugarte thrived under Amorim as a Sporting player. His form through two seasons – 61 starts in 85 appearances – earned the midfielder his £50million move to PSG. When Amorim took over from Ten Hag, Ugarte was expected to gain more than most.",
      "Instead, Ugarte is going under. Amorim hinted in pre-season at Ugarte’s struggles with confidence and ‘off the pitch’ matters that may be hampering his efforts to establish himself in United’s midfield. The manager wasn’t telling anyone what we had not already assumed from the sight of opponents running off the back of Ugarte and some questionable decision making on the ball.",
      "In many ways, Ugarte’s struggle is a symbol of the wider sentiment around United. The feeling most prominent in the manager’s mind, if not resignation, is hope rather than expectation. But if Ugarte is ever to emerge from whatever slump he has fallen in to, it has to happen now.",

      "As is always the case, three weeks into the new Premier League campaign, many of us are considering a career switch as we reflect on our pre-season predictions.",
      "Florian Wirtz as PFA Player of the Year? Sunderland going down? Idiots.",
      "It remains a cause of great frustration for us soothsayers that the transfer window remains open after the start of the season and believe it shutting on Monday merits another bash at those predictions.",
      "",
      "Liverpool winning three games from three having played well for roughly 30 minutes across those victories over their greatest title challengers Arsenal, a raging Newcastle and a Bournemouth side that’s won both games besides without conceding a goal puts them way out in front as title favourites, if they weren’t already, as they will play well at some point, with the small matter of a new £130m striker to aid them in that quest.",
      "",
      "Wouldn’t it be neat if the top four after three games was the top four at the end of the season, and d’you know what? We think it just might be. Chelsea have had favourable fixtures but have added a bit of The Arsenal to their armoury, while The Arsenal arguably now have too much of The Arsenal for even Eberechi Eze to balance out, so they’re coming third.",
      "And while Manchester City’s opening day thumping of Wolves led to knee-jerk claims that they were Back, two defeats in two since, including one with Rodri at the base of their midfield, suggests they’re still more than a bit 2024/2025. Tottenham meanwhile have hired a very good manager and had a perfectly serviceable transfer window, in the end.",
      "",
      "We’re far from convinced that the signing of striker Tolu Arokodare from Genk will move the needle enough for pointless Wolves, who also kept hold of Jorgen Strand Larsen, but we can’t see much of a creative spark anywhere. West Ham confused us greatly with that win over Nottingham Forest and will probably have enough anyway. Burnley and Leeds to join Wolves.",
      "",
      "Kudos to Joe Williams for picking Sunderland as the pleasant surprise before they picked up as many wins (2) in their first three Premier League games as Southampton managed in the whole of last season.",
      "And with their newfound status as a Premier League stalwart they signed Manchester United-linked Brian Brobbey and former Chelsea winger Bertrand Traore from Ajax on deadline day, while Arsenal-linked Lutsharel Geertruida joined on loan from RB Leipzig. That’s big boy sh*t, yeah.",
      "",
      "Nick Wolte… nah. That would be f***ing brilliant though, wouldn’t it? Him and Yoane Wissa do have a very good chance of beating the tally of the strikers they’ve replaced (23: Alexander Isak – 23; Callum Wilson – 0) but we’re not convinced either will a) play enough to win it or b) be prolific enough get anywhere close to matching Erling Haaland, who will presumably bumble his way to 30-odd to come out on top after three in his first three games.",
      "Isak arguably had a better chance of winning it by staying at Newcastle, as he’s set to share the goalscoring load with Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike after his excellent start to the season. Regretting it already, we imagine.",
      "",
      "There were three Joao Pedro calls before the season started and he’s already got two goals and two assists. Chelsea’s best player being a striker is very, very strange.",
      "",
      "Plenty went for Viktor Gyokeres and after one very good game and two in which he did next to nothing he may not prove to be Arsenal’s all-conquering solution, but also doesn’t look as though he will stink the place out. Benjamin Sesko, however.",
      "Four off-target shots in 80 minutes of Premier League football off the bench following a £66m move to solve Ruben Amorim’s goalscoring woes probably isn’t exactly what he had in mind, and he did himself no favours by stepping up tenth in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far.",
      "",
      "Jack bloody Grealish. We can’t not count loan moves in this after four assists in two-and-a-bit games. Not sure we’ve ever been more pleased for a footballer ever.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz looks more likely to be in a different category and it’s not biggest bloody bargain. Cole Palmer’s not really played. F*** knows. A Liverpool player probably. Virgil van Dijk.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo will be lucky to survive the international break, if indeed he wants to keep his job and we really don’t think he does.",
      "His relationship with transfer guru Edu looks to be beyond mending and we can’t imagine owner Evangelos Marinakis is overly thrilled by Nuno leaving their club-record signing out of his 25-man Europa League squad having bankrolled their biggest transfer window in history and the sixth-biggest in world football this summer.",
      "It feels as though he’s putting nails in his own coffin.",
      "",
      "Arsenal have been handed a favourable Champions League draw, which matters in so much as Mikel Arteta can rest and rotate players rather than it making any real difference to the knockout stages, they’ve now got a very deep squad and may be boosted in their bid to go all the way in Europe when the Premier League becomes a near impossibility in the new year.",
      "",
      "A proper f***ing title race.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund ‘considers himself better’ than summer signing Benjamin Sesko after signing for Napoli on loan, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak finally forced his dream move to Liverpool to conclude a summer transfer window defined by clubs being desperate to pay a Premier League tax.",
      "Manchester United’s current woes are being left at the feet of pretty much everyone. Can this all be Ruben Amorim’s fault?",
      "Only Andre Onana was rated lower than the £74m signing who waited until the very end to take his penalty in the shootout.",
      "Manchester United losing to Grimsby has prompted all manner of responses, but most want Ruben Amorim out of the club.",

      "Man Utd “could live to regret” their decision to sign Senne Lammens over Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, according to ESPN journalist Mark Ogden.",
      "The Red Devils mainly strengthened their attack in the summer transfer window with around £200m spent on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "They did bring in a new goalkeeper on deadline day with Lammens signing from Royal Antwerp for a fee of £18.2m after deciding to go for the Belgian rather than Martinez.",
      "There had been reports that Man Utd were ‘leaning towards’ a deal for Aston Villa keeper Martinez before deciding last minute to concentrate their efforts on Lammens.",
      "A report on Wednesday claimed that Sunderland and Leeds had both looked at Lammens earlier in the transfer window and decided to pull out of deals as the goalkeeper ‘did not convince other top-flight clubs when they assessed him’.",
      "And Ogden reckons their decision to not pursue the Argentina international over Lammens could come back to bite them this season.",
      "READ: Why the five post-Fergie Man Utd managers before Amorim were sacked",
      "Ogden told ESPN: “They were playing a strange game with the goalkeepers. It looked like Emi Martinez was on his way to Man United, but they preferred Lammens.",
      "“I’m kind of surprised by that because, for me, Martinez is what they need right now. They need someone with a strength of character, personality, and world-class ability to sort out the defence and add confidence.",
      "“They believe that Lammens is the better bet, and that the cost of getting Martinez on a short-term loan was too high in terms of wages, so they went with Lammens. I think they could live to regret that.”",
      "Altay Bayindir has been starting ahead of Andre Onana, who could still leave in the next week, this season with the latter only playing in their League Cup defeat to Grimsby Town on penalties.",
      "It is unclear whether Lammens will come in to be No.1 or start behind Bayindir but the Belgian is excited about his move to Man Utd.",
      "Lammens told MUTV: “This is my dream move. When I was five, United was at the height of football and you keep in your memory how big Manchester United is, so, when I heard they were interested, it was like a childhood dream.",
      "“I remember being a kid, Manchester United winning the Champions League and winning the league, and also [I want] to help the team get to a level that you can compete for a title again and to play Champions League again. That’s also one of my biggest points, that I want to grow with the team and go up to the heights that used to be Manchester United.",
      "“It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and the Premier League is the biggest competition in the world.",
      "“In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.",
      "“It’s crazy. So, that was also a big part of why I chose Manchester United. I’m very happy that we could get it done today.”",
      "Man Utd hope Senne Lammens will reward them by becoming their long-term No.1. In the meantime, the Red Devils must accept the risk of choosing potential over proven…",
      "Premier League rivals Leeds and Sunderland chose to reject the signing of new Man Utd goalkeeper Senne Lammens in the summer, according to reports.",

      "Aston Villa are reportedly ‘bitter’ after Man Utd signed Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, despite offering more money for the 23-year-old.",
      "Manchester United reportedly decided to sign Senne Lammens over Emiliano Martinez for two key reasons, while one star ‘will go’ in the coming days.",

      "It’s the only thing footballers say if they want to continue to play football under a manager at risk of the sack. What’s the alternative? Blast the philosophy and tactics? Under-fire managers will continue to have the full public support and backing of the players until the time comes when they’re no longer the manager. But as Phil Jones says, there are inevitably United players who “don’t like” Amorim.",
      "“Do I think there were players at United who didn’t like him? To be honest, that’s probably a ridiculous question because I’d say there are people in the United team now who don’t like the manager,” Jones told Ladbrokes.",
      "As there will be at Manchester City under Pep Guardiola and Liverpool under Arne Slot – we can’t imagine Federico Chiesa’s too enamoured with the Reds boss right now, for example.",

Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee know full well that the only effect of breaking ranks to have a go at the manager will for them to be jettisoned from the first team and made to train away from the squad. What’s the use in picking up a spade when Amorim is doing such a stand-up job of digging his own Manchester United grave?",
      "It will be particularly difficult for Mainoo to accept that he’s “the problem” and not Amorim. He’s gone from being a Manchester United and England pin-up when Amorim arrived to a benchwarmer denied a loan exit in search of game time in a World Cup year.",

      "Rio Ferdinand thinks the decision from Man Utd not to push the boat out for Tottenham legend Harry Kane is “the biggest mistake they’ve made in the last ten years”.",
      "The Red Devils have not properly challenged for a Premier League title since 2013, when they won the English top flight under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Ferguson left after that title victory, with numerous managers attempting to follow his success at Old Trafford, but failing to bring back the good times.",
      "Ruben Amorim, whose side finished 15th last season, is the latest to attempt to get Man Utd challenging again – but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS could take a few transfer windows to rectify mistakes made in past markets.",
      "Big money spent on players like Antony, Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and others, mean that the Red Devils have certain financial issues to navigate, including PSR.",
      "Man Utd ended up spending around £200m on new attackers this summer, in the form of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko – but Ferdinand reckons their forward line would be “in a different place” now if they had signed England striker Kane in 2023.",
      "READ: Why the five post-Fergie Man Utd managers before Amorim were sacked",
      "Kane eventually moved to Bayern Munich in 2023 for €100m plus €10m in add-ons, which broke the Bundesliga transfer record, while Declan Rice completed a £105m move to Arsenal from West Ham in the same window.",
      "And Ferdinand reckons Man Utd would be in a much better place now if the board had pushed to complete game-changing deals for Kane and Rice.",
      "In reference to Man Utd’s failure to sign Kane during his time at Tottenham, Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: “That’s the biggest mistake they’ve made in the last ten years.",
      "“If they paid the number Spurs wanted, they would have got him. It’s weird to think that it didn’t happen because of a couple of million here and there, it was a terrible decision.",
      "“I honestly think and I’m convinced that if Man United would have got Harry Kane and Declan Rice in that window, they’re in a different place now.",
      "“It goes back to the environment, those two drive an environment I think because they’re two top pros.”",
      "Former Man Utd striker Michael Owen added: “Harry Kane should have happened I think. They could have got him I think. They could have got him, couldn’t they?”",
      "Despite a mixed start to the new season under Amorim, Ferdinand is confident that the tide will turn when Man Utd start converting some of their big chances.",
      "Ferdinand said: “We’re miles ahead of anyone, so we’re functioning in a certain way, but we’re not being killers. We need time to understand what’s going on, and I hope the manager is conveying to the players that they have to keep believing.",
      "“They might not be getting results, or performing perfectly for 90 minutes, but … he should be telling them, ‘If we finish those chances, the dynamics and results of games change, so stay with me.’ I hope he’s having those conversations.”",

      "Ruben Amorim may well look at the fate that’s befallen five of his six Manchester United predecessors this summer and think twice about resigning. A post-Old Trafford future looks just as bleak.",
      "After a quite extraordinary week at the end of a depressing summer for former Manchester United managers, while we’re sure Ruben Amorim continues to picture his calm and stress free life away from Old Trafford, he may now be wondering if – for the sake of his managerial career – he has to make this work.",
      "As he rocked from side to side on the bench in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town he looked like a man who would rather be anywhere else, and the head shakes and frustration displayed against Burnley suggest this will be an international break of introspection for the United boss despite the breathing space that last-gasp victory has granted him.",
      "After he reportedly had to be talked down from the ledge in January following a 3-1 home defeat to Brighton, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, there is once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "Reports suggest Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS remain as staunchly wedded to their underperforming manager as Amorim is to his failing philosophy. It feels as though Amorim is closer to walking than being sacked, but we’re not convinced the nuance of his exit from Old Trafford will save him from a fate that has befallen five of his six predecessors.",
      "All of Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, Erik ten Hag and Ruud van Nistelrooy are currently without clubs having been employed either last season, this season or both before being sacked this summer.",
      "The most notable and brutal of those dismissals was Ten Hag’s from Bayer Leverkusen. The Dutchman has hit out at his ‘unprecedented’ sacking just two games into the Bundesliga season, while reports in Germany claim that the ill feeling towards Ten Hag at the club meant that sporting director Simon Rolfes had, if anything, ‘waited too long’ to get rid of him.",
      "In a very familiar tale for United fans, Ten Hag ‘failed to convey ideas’ and ‘no-one knew what to do’, leading long-serving members of staff to mock him through open debates as to whether he was the worst manager in the club’s history.",
      "Mourinho was shown the Fenerbahce door after they failed to get through the Champions League play-offs, though it’s claimed his sacking had been coming thanks to his uninspiring football and his increasingly public clashes with the club hierarchy over transfers.",
      "Solskjaer steered Besiktas to fourth last season having taken charge in January but was dismissed after defeat to Swiss side Lausanne in the Conference League play-offs on Thursday meant the club would not be playing European football this season.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough after the club failed to reach the Championship play-offs for the second consecutive season, with four wins from four games to start the new campaign under Rob Edwards making that look like a very good call. And Van Nistelrooy was sent packing by Leicester after winning just four of 25 Premier League games last term having taken the reins after his interim stint at United",
      "It offers Amorim an incredibly grim view of what his post-United career might be like and Ralf Rangnick being the only one out of the last six to have retained his job, as Austria head coach, suggests the Portuguese boss, praised for his honest appraisal of the basket case he’s in charge of, should go one step further and declare the need for “open-heart surgery”, as Rangnick famously insisted was a requirement to fix a football club which quite clearly remains broken.",

      "‘These sources understand that INEOS are still reflecting on the matter, as they would certainly prefer to offload the 29-year-old on a permanent basis, but they also realise that this might be a big ask amidst the current circumstances.’",
      "If he’s set to be left out of the Man Utd side going forward then Onana is ‘open’ to a transfer but it ‘remains to be seen if he’ll be open to joining the Turkish club’.",
      "Onana arrived at Man Utd in the summer of 2023 from Inter Milan in a deal worth £47.5m as the replacement for long-serving goalkeeper David de Gea.",

      "Ferdinand said recently on his YouTube channel: “I wouldn’t have sold David de Gea, I would never have let him go… simple as that. I don’t know why he was ever allowed to leave the building.

      "Bruno Fernandes’ stoppage time penalty kept the sack wolves from Ruben Amorim’s door for the international break as a 3-2 victory over newly promoted Burnley granted the Portuguese boss a novel experience in his shockingly poor Old Trafford tenure to date: a spot in the top half of the Premier League.",
      "The boost of an all-new forward line signed during the transfer window has been offset by the failure to fix an enduring midfield problem felt by at least two managers before him, while a goalkeeper has been signed who will likely add to his No.1 conundrum rather than solve it, in the short-term at least.",
      "He reached a United nadir in defeat to League Two Grimsby Town and any significant increase on his 26 per cent Premier League win percentage feels unlikely despite him having a pre-season to bed in his ideas and a philosophy he remains staunchly wedded to despite it showing no signs of coming good.",
      "United continue to back him in the faint hope that a group of unsuitable players for his system will miraculously grasp the nettle, or be coached into grasping it, with the alternative an admission of either his botched appointment or more deeply-rooted problems in a football club that were supposed to have been fixed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team.",
      "INEOS ‘will not be decided by a knee-jerk reaction to one or two bad results’ and with a view to winning the Premier League in 2028 ‘believe changing philosophy now would be a greater risk than persevering with Amorim’. But they have given him an ultimatum.",
      "‘The expectation is Champions League football. Falling short of that target may be tolerated if progress is evident, but missing out on European competition entirely would likely prove fatal to Amorim’s tenure.’",
      "But there are presumably alternative final straws which could trigger his sacking – if indeed he doesn’t walk before he’s pushed – and while his post-Sir Alex Ferguson predecessors all have being a bit sh*t as a commonality in their dismissals, we’ve picked out the key reason they were sent packing from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "As crimes go, not being the most successful manager in Premier League history is barely worth a slap on the wrists. And in hindsight, even given Sir Alex Ferguson’s standing as Mr Manchester United by the summer of 2013, a football club allowing a sitting manager to select their replacement is a madness, especially when Fergie’s selection criteria appeared to be ‘a guy I like’, ‘quite old’ and ‘Scottish’.",
      "The passage of time and the shortcomings of those who have come after him have worked in Moyes’ favour. Feelings at the time that he wasn’t given a fair shot with Marouane Fellaini his sole summer signing to aid an ageing squad have only grown since since to a point where most feel sympathy for Moyes at taking a job he couldn’t turn down but was doomed to fail in.",
      "Unai Emery similarly endured the difficulties of replacing a legacy Premier League manager at Arsenal, while Arne Slot’s success at Liverpool is in large part down to the rebuilding work already done by honorary scouser Jurgen Klopp, who left him with a squad ready to win the title rather than a title-winning squad past the peak of its powers.",

      "“The players looked bored themselves,” Paul Scholes said in January 2016 having watched Van Gaal’s side labour to a 1-0 FA Cup third-round win over Sheffield United. “There’s no spirit, there’s nobody having a go at each other, there’s no smiling, there’s no entertainment.”",
      "United failed to score in 23 of the Dutchman’s 103 games in charge and drew 19 of their 76 in the Premier League, with the majority of Van Gaal-based entertainment emanating from the touchline or in press conferences.",
      "Responding to Scholes’ criticism, which by no means limited to the above, Van Gaal questioned whether his comments were for “the benefit of the club, or the benefit of himself?” He never got the United punditry cabal onside and the fans echoed their sentiments of apathy over the style of football, which led to third and fifth-placed finishes in the Premier League, with the FA Cup gong at the end of his second season not enough to save Van Gaal from a tide that had turned through weeks and months of stale football.",
      "",
      "Mourinho has claimed that “one of the best jobs of my career was to finish second with Man United in the Premier League” in a hot take which has since become lukewarm as his successors have boosted the notion that it was indeed a praise-worthy achievement in a post-Fergie era.",
      "A confrontational style of leadership, a public rift with Paul Pogba, slams of Luke Shaw among others and a general feeling among staff that he was a ‘high maintenance’ manager, meant that questions as to whether he was ‘the right fit’ started on day one and never got close to being dispelled despite that runner-up finish and the Europa League and League Cup wins.",
      "A public flirtation with PSG on the back of consistent claims by Mourinho that he was not being backed in the transfer market, including days after buying Fred for £50m, led to a feeling that by the end (let’s face it, probably throughout) he felt he was bigger than the club.",

      "There have been entirely predictable wonderings, revisions of reality and distortions of the truth on United Twitter after the fans have watched admittedly less exciting and usually far less effective football under Ten Hag and Amorim than they saw under Solskjaer.",
      "Clipped up videos of the best goals in the Solskjaer era make for absorbing viewing. The players did things like one-touch passing, showed speed on the break and often genuinely looked as though they were enjoying the thing they were being paid multi-millions of pounds to do.",
      "The problem with Solskjaer was, the long and short of his footballing ethos appeared to be ‘you’re good footballers, go out there and play good football’. Now, while we by no means sign up to this mood-killing obsession with philosophy and strict guidelines, and would like nothing more than an unshackled team being successful, the reality of modern day football is that success can’t be powered by vibes.",
      "Solskjaer arrived armed with little more than his legendary status as a footballer at Old Trafford and it never felt as though he ever got past the point of being no more than a guy too old to be in the XIs he was selecting, with the respect he earned from his players based on him scoring a goal in 1999 rather than from any instruction on the training pitch or from the sidelines.",
      "",
      "His Manchester United tenure was defined by a clash between his build-from-the-back style and the ‘Manchester United DNA’ he obsessively referenced as something he had to adhere to, along with some heroically awful signings.",

      "Pep Guardiola was seen as the man who ushered in the era of the small and technically gifted player but what he utilised was a generation of Spanish, but in particular Barcelona-trained players who had been nurtured to work on their technical ability. Now, we are seeing that same technical ability being demanded across the world but not just of the smaller players.",
      "If in the past it was accepted that for what you lose in technical ability, tall players make up for it with their aerial supremacy; now we have players like Isak who can challenge in the air but also be great with the ball on the deck. Erling Haaland is another example and perhaps one of the most representative given that he plays for the man who popularised the short passing game.",
      "The role of a striker has also changed significantly. If in the past they were the main focal point of attack, they are now there to contribute and free up space for others as much as they are to score. The rise of goalscoring inside forwards like Mo Salah and Bukayo Saka demonstrates this.",
      "The fact that this has happened in the Premier League should not be a surprise either as it has always been one of the most physically demanding leagues.",
      "Football tactics and styles are cyclical, meaning you can predict that one day the preference may well be to go back to the shorter centre-forward but for now, there can be no doubt about it: the big man up top is back.",
      "It’s not just up front where we will see some giants either, here are the top 10 tallest outfield players in the league this season:",

      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",

      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",

The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",

      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""

      "Premier League spending passed the £3bn mark in a record-breaking window capped by Alexander Isak's £125m move from Newcastle to Liverpool; Isak was one of numerous strikers to move for big money as clubs sought to add firepower",
      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 16:02, UK",
      "",
      "Premier League clubs spent more than £3bn on new signings in total, shattering the previous record of £2.44bn set in 2023.",
      "Clubs also set a record for the amount of money recouped from player sales at £1.8bn. The buying and selling added up to an all-time-high net spend of £1.2bn.",
      "Liverpool spent the most at a record-breaking £446.5m but Arsenal had the highest net spend at £257m, followed by Liverpool at £218.4m, then Spurs and Manchester United.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Bournemouth emerged from the window £65.8m in the black after selling a raft of star players, including defenders Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Isak was the most expensive signing of the window at a British-record £125m, followed by Florian Wirtz at £116.5m, while Hugo Ekitike (£79m, Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool), Benjamin Sesko (£73.7m, RB Leipzig to Man Utd), and Bryan Mbeumo (£71m, Brentford to Man Utd) also made big-money moves.Adam Smith",
      "It seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.",
      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Newcastle finally sanctioned the departure of Isak to Liverpool as they completed the £55m signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford having already brought in Nick Woltemade for £69m from Stuttgart.",
      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",
      "Brighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.",
      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",
      "And as long as the smart recruitment continues, the cycle will go on.Dan Long",
