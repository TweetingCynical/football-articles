      "Calvert-Lewin has left Everton after nine years and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016 and is seeking a fresh start.",
      "He has struggled with injuries in recent years, but The Sun reports that United believe he has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad.

With Cunha a No.10 and Mbeumo best off the right wing, Calvert-Lewin could slot into the forward line as a No.9.",

This choice to move on was not simply about me, it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together.",
      "\"We believe it's the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn't lessen the bond I'll always have with Everton. I'm deeply proud of what we've shared, fighting for this club when it mattered most, scoring big goals in crucial moments, wearing the shirt with commitment and pride. My hope is that I leave with your respect, knowing I always sought to uphold the values of this great club.\"",

      "“ There is a lot of talk,\" Elanga said while on international duty last month, per Sport Witness. \"I focus on what I can do and my focus today was on the match. In football there are always rumours. The most important thing is that I focus on what I can control.”",

      "Mbeumo is keen on a move to Manchester United this summer, but Brentford have already rejected two bids for the forward. United's last bid was worth an initial £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons and Brentford are said to want more than the £62.5m the Red Devils paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"He had a fantastic season,\" Brentford's director of football Phil Giles recently said when asked about Mbeumo's future. \"We expected big interest in him; we have had big interest in him.

      "After weeks of fraught negotiations, Williams decided to instead sign a new 10-YEAR contract with Athletic Bilbao. That's left Barcelona looking for alternatives to strengthen their attacking department.",

Joining the Red Devils from PSG in 2004, a Premier League title followed as the Old Trafford faithful adored his full-blooded commitment on the pitch – until he tried to leave United under hugely controversial circumstances.",
      "Heinze's next move was viewed as self-sabotage of the highest order as the Argentinian star set fire to his United legacy when he attempted to force a move to Liverpool in the summer of 2007.",
      "In doing so he subsequently broke one of English football's most sacred yet unwritten rules: players not move from United to their bitter rivals and vice-versa.",
      "Heinze, now 47, is now set to join Mikel Arteta’s coaching staff at Arsenal ahead of the new season as the Gunners are in the midst of a coaching reshuffle, with former assistant Carlos Cuesta having departed for Parma.",
      "Heinze's return to the Premier League will no doubt ignite memories of one of English football's most brutal transfer sagas of when the Argentinian was seeking to traipse the M62 divide and join then-manager Rafa Benitez at Liverpool.",
      "The controversial switch would have made him the first player since Phil Chisnall in 1964 to move directly between the two sides. Yet the union of Heinze and Liverpool will always be a case of 'What if?' Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson spectacularly dug his heels in to ensure that the defender would never get his wish.",
      "It began as Heinze's agent, Roberto Rodriguez, was reportedly informed by United's then-chief executive David Gill that he could leave for £6.8million. Yet United never foresaw that the full-back would clamour for a switch to their greatest rivals.",
      "An offer matching United's valuation was then indeed lodged by the Reds. However, the Red Devils knocked back Liverpool's proposal, to Heinze's dismay, and so lawyers were consulted.",
      "The legendary United boss also claimed United were in the driving seat over the move. Benitez however was left stunned by United's refusal to play ball.",
      "\"It’s clear he’s a player we like and he’s a very good player,\" Liverpool's Spanish boss said. \"That’s the reason why they don’t want him to leave for us.\"",
      "In another twist to one of the Premier League's bloodiest transfer tussles, it later emerged that Crystal Palace were offered the chance to buy Heinze by a South American-based agency, and then sell him to Liverpool straight after.",
      "This would allegedly pocket the Eagles £1m in compensation, as revealed by former Palace chairman Simon Jordan in his memoir, Be Careful What You Wish For.",
      "\"My stance was no way were we getting involved and I told Alexander to contact David Gill, Manchester United’s chief executive, and tell him of these attempted shenanigans, which he duly did,\" Jordan wrote.",
      "Heinze and his agent eventually took the case to a Premier League arbitration panel in a bid to engineer the move. However, Jordan's evidence was later used in the hearing which saw United prevail.",
      "After losing the right to move to Liverpool, Heinze told the Daily Mail: \"My fight is for the freedom to negotiate with any club. United never wanted me to leave for one of the big clubs, but this anti-Liverpool clause is incredible.\"",
      "Liverpool were reportedly expecting Heinze to appeal. Yet a late charge never materialised from the player as United accepted a bid from Real Madrid.",
      "\"I don't have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them,\" Heinze later said of the ordeal. \"I spent three years in Manchester and had some great moments and I regret [leaving the club] a lot.\"",
      "After United, Heinze went on to play for Madrid, Marseille and Roma. The ex-Argentina international called time on his career in 2014 and has since ventured into management, however he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Arteta and Heinze previously played together at PSG but they will now reunite at the Emirates Stadium. It's fully expected that Heinze's journey to work at another of United's fierce rivals will be without drama this time around."

I asked him for it. I’m proud to get this number 10 shirt from Muniain. And to make history as he did.”",

      "Heinze represented PSG, Man United, Real Madrid, Marseille and Roma across what was a glittering career, winning league titles in England, Spain, France and Argentina. He was also named the United player of the year in 2005.",
      "The 72-time Argentina international retired in 2014 and has since moved into management with Argentinian sides Gody Cruz, Newell’s Old Boys, Argentinos Juniors and Velez Sarsfield, while he also had a stint with MLS outfit Atlanta United. But he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Meanwhile, the man who he replaced, Cuesta, has only just launched his managerial career and recently explained why he chose to leave Arsenal. Speaking in a press conference, he said: “I’m honoured to be part of a high-level club in Italy and abroad.",
      "How will Arsenal do next season? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "\"It was a natural choice, as I had felt great trust from the very start of the negotiations. Age can be a surprise, but it’s always been this way for me. Age is just a number.",
      "\"I don’t want it to be an excuse, I want to be assessed as the Parma coach and do my best as I’ve always done in my life.”",
      "He added: “I didn’t expect it. I was focused on my work at Arsenal, and I was really happy. However, when the chance came, I thought it was the right one. I’ve tried to get ready in the best way.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United's players are entering their last weekend before pre-season training kicks off on Monday with a reminder from Ruben Amorim that they will be expected to post personal bests across a series of physical challenges.",
      "But Amorim is still waiting for an update around potential arrivals and departures with interest in Viktor Gyokeres cooling, an eagerness to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford maintained and a host of speculation around expected departures.",
      "That includes wingers Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, both of whom could head abroad with Serie A on the cards for the former in a bargain deal. Argentina's Garnacho, however, will cost around £50m.",
      "Here are the transfer tales to keep tabs on from in and around Old Trafford.",
      "Jadon Sancho has held talks with Juventus in a bid to end his miserable time at Old Trafford.",
      "England winner Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea but the Blues decided against paying £5m to make his move permanent. He moved to United from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73m but has scored just nine goals.",
      "And with no future under Ruben Amorim at United, he is seeking a move abroad and the Serie A giants have made their firm interest clear, according to various reports.",
      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane would have taken Alejandro Garnacho out on the training pitch for his latest show of petulance. Garnacho, who has fallen out of favour at United, posted on social media a picture of him wearing an Aston Villa top with Marcus Rashford's name and number on the back.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa after falling out with boss Ruben Amorim, and Garnacho's provocative stunt was seen as him taunting the United boss after he, too, suffered the same fate as the England forward.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for United's 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao, prompting the winger – who turned 21 yesterday – to publicly criticise Amorim over the decision and reveal he was considering his future.",
      "That in turn convinced Amorim that Garnacho has no place in his future plans, with the club actively looking to sell the £50million-rated Argentina international this summer.",
      "Former United striker Louis Saha said ex-skipper Keane would have dealt with Garnacho in the most brutal way possible – by subjecting him to a series of fierce tackles on the training pitch to show him he was out of line.",
      "Romelu Lukaku has claimed that he never wanted a move to Manchester United but was swayed by his agent. The Belgian striker signed for the Red Devils in 2017 in a £75m deal.",
      "His switch came after a prolific spell with Everton having scored 87 goals in 166 appearances for the Toffees. And things started well for Lukaku at Old Trafford having scored 27 goals across his debut campaign.",
      "But things soon went awry having fallen out of favour during his second season, while he found the net just 15 times. Lukaku was eventually sold to Italian giants Inter Milan. The forward has now admitted that he was never clamouring for a move to United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "‌United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, and Leon is expected to be assessed in pre-season before a final decision is made on his next steps.",
      "Leon spoke to journalists before travelling to Manchester earlier this week, saying: “The sensations are inexplicable. You feel so many things. The truth is, I’m very happy, very happy to be there. I think every player dreams of this, and I have the opportunity.",

      "The two clubs remain locked in talks with Brentford holding out for an improved offer and United seeking to find a compromise.",

      "But that will take movement on either side for a deal to be struck. United had an opening offer totalling £55million rejected in early June and returned with an improved bid of more than £60million but the Bees rebuffed the advance.",
      "Brentford are standing their ground and until United stump up the cash, the Londoners will hold firm. The longer the saga goes on, the more chance there is of the dial moving towards United as both sides seek a conclusion amid the player's preference to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Brentford sporting director Phil Giles spoke this week about Mbeumo potentially remaining at the Gtech Stadium although that still seems unlikely with both clubs accepting that there is a deal to be done.",
      "\"There's significant interest in Bryan. I think it's been documented and publicised about, you know, his current preference,\" said Giles.",
      "\"From what I understand, if needs be, he's happy to stay at Brentford next year as well, so listen, let's see on that. I think our position is he had an unbelievable season last year and we expected interest in him. If that deal is right, then there's a deal to do, but if not, then he'll stay.\"",
      "Giles was asked about conversations regarding Mbeumo staying at Brentford and responded: \"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he is going to depart this summer.",
      "\"There is interest. He had a great season last season, so the interest is inevitable. If we get the right offer, there is potentially a deal to be done, but there's only so much we can say on that.\""

      "If you want proof that time flies, David de Gea left Manchester United two years ago.",
      "De Gea departed upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 and, after spending the entirety of the next season as a free agent, he signed for Fiorentina in August 2024.",
      "Many felt the Spaniard going a year without a club was vindication of the decision to allow him to leave. De Gea made high-profile mistakes toward the end of his time in Manchester and United believed they needed to evolve. Andre Onana was identified as the ideal successor and signed from Inter Milan.",
      "Two years later, De Gea will return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly. The 34-year-old recently signed a one-year contract extension with Fiorentina and is expected to start against United next month.",
      "De Gea will be looking forward to his return to Manchester. He regularly engages with former teammates on social media and replies to videos of his best saves during his time at United.",
      "The goalkeeper's legacy is fascinating to analyse ahead of his first appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "For a long time, De Gea was the best goalkeeper in the world, although his time at United didn't end on a positive note and recency bias affected how some supporters remember him.",
      "De Gea's final season was pretty quirky, given he made some game-deciding saves and kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League, but became a target for opponents when the ball was at his feet.",
      "His performance against Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals was the beginning of the end. De Gea conceded within 10 minutes, playing a pass short when he should have gone long, and his second error was embarrassing.",
      "De Gea misjudged Sevilla's speculative punt forward and seemed to forget how to kick a ball, botching the clearance, which allowed Youssef En-Nesyri to slot into an open goal to make it 3-0.",
      "United were second best in every area at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium on that evening, but De Gea made the headlines and even newspapers in his homeland slammed his display.",
      "Sevilla was the straw that broke the camel's back regarding De Gea's future at United, and then the FA Cup final happened and Ilkay Gundogan scored within 13 seconds at Wembley.",
      "After those two episodes on the big stage, Erik ten Hag had a straightforward decision to make.",
      "\"I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,\" De Gea wrote when his exit was confirmed.",
      "\"I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. We've achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club.",
      "\"I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers.",
      "\"It's been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didn't think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together.",
      "\"Now, it's the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me. We've seen it all.\"",
      "De Gea left behind an outstanding record, having made 545 appearances for United and been part of the team that won the 2012/13 Premier League title with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge.",
      "The goalkeeper also won the FA Cup in 2016, the Carabao Cup in 2017 and 2023, as well as the Europa League in 2017. De Gea is seventh on the club's all-time appearance list.",
      "Bruno Fernandes recently won the Sir Matt Busby award for a fourth time, meaning the midfielder joined De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to pick up the prize on four occasions.",
      "De Gea faced intense scrutiny at the end of his time in Manchester, but he will be remembered among the greatest United goalkeepers, and some will regard him as the greatest.",
      "Peter Schmeichel probably has that status, although there is no denying De Gea is a modern-day legend and he served United for long enough to deserve a testimonial at Old Trafford.",
      "Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick were all given testimonials in appreciation of their service and De Gea should be given the same.",
      "De Gea has not spoken about his departure from United and there is a feeling that the circumstances of his exit don't sit well with him. But the two figures who were responsible, Ten Hag and John Murtough, have moved on and he would likely accept a testimonial when he decides to hang up his gloves.",
      "For now, De Gea will have to settle for returning to Old Trafford for Fiorentina's pre-season friendly.",
      "He will receive a brilliant reception and it's great to see him enjoying his football again."

      "Things looked very different for Manchester's two football powerhouses a couple of years ago.",
      "Manchester United were ostensibly on the up under Erik ten Hag, ending their trophy drought in the Dutchman's first year at the helm and securing a third-place finish in the Premier League. Champions League football was set to return to Old Trafford and there was reason for optimism.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester City were sitting pretty as the kings of England and Europe, with the world crown soon set to follow. A lot has changed since then.",
      "City are in the midst of a squad rebuild having been dethroned as Premier League champions. Pep Guardiola's side are struggling to get back to their imperious best, having scraped qualification for the Champions League and been knocked out of the Club World Cup by Al Hilal.",
      "And then there's United. 15th in the Premier League last season, no European football to look forward and a mishmash of a squad that needs gutting.",
      "The summer transfer window represents a crucial time for two sides looking to send a message to the rest of the Premier League. Outgoings will be as important as incomings, and the two clubs may find themselves in direct competition.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish both enjoyed superb 2022/23 seasons, with the former bagging the first 30-goal haul of his career and Grealish playing a vital role in City's historical treble. Their stock has fallen dramatically since then and both could be on the move this summer.",
      "Rashford has told United he wants to leave and City are searching for a buyer for Grealish. While Rashford and Grealish are two very different players, both forwards will command hefty wages and their respective clubs won't be willing to let them leave for pennies - United want £40m for Rashford and that same figure is claimed to be enough to sign Grealish this summer.",
      "Moving them on isn't going to be easy, and the task will only be made tougher by a club on the other side of the city looking to sell a player who will undoubtedly be linked with the same clubs.",
      "Few could have envisioned Rashford and Grealish being sold a few years ago. Both players needs to find new clubs this summer, but that's easier said than done."

      "After finishing the 2023/24 season with a -1 goal difference, they inexplicably only made one addition to their attacking ranks, with Joshua Zirkzee arriving from Bolonga.",
      "Zirkzee's haul of 12 goals the previous season did little to suggest he would be the solution to United's attacking woes, and so it proved. United tallied just 44 goals in their 38 Premier League outings last term, recording a -10 goal difference.",
      "The arrival of Matheus Cunha will certainly help, and if United can get a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line then they'll be well on the way to addressing their blunt attack. But a new striker is a non-negotiable. Even a top-half finish looks a stretch with Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee leading the line.",
      "The problem United have is goalscorers are hard to come by, especially when a lot of other clubs are in the market for one.",
      "United have already lost out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, and if the gossip columns are to be believed then Viktor Gyokeres could be on his way to Arsenal.",
      "Another big club who were on the hunt for a striker this summer were Juventus. The Serie A giants were always going to look to bring a striker in this summer, with their weak attack one of the reasons they failed to mount a serious title challenge last season. For context, Atalanta finished one place above Juventus in Serie A yet scored 20 more goals than Igor Tudor's side.",
      "Jonathan David's move to Turin means Juventus have got the striker they craved, and while David's move means there is one fewer striker on the market for United to target, it could help them in the long run.",
      "Completing one of their main summer objectives without spending a penny should free up funds for Juve to strengthen in other areas. Jadon Sancho has been linked with a move to the Allianz Stadium in recent weeks, with Alejandro Garnacho also tentatively linked.",
      "United know they need to offload Sancho and Garnacho this summer, with both players expressing their desire to explore options elsewhere.",
      "Signing a world-class striker for free would have been a great but of business by United - although there's no concrete evidence that the Reds explored a deal - but a club that's been linked with some of United's wantaway stars suddenly having some extra funds to play with might be the next best thing."

      "12 months on, and Watkins has fallen down the pecking order for club and country.",
      "He has not played for England in 2025, although injury ruled him out of the most recent camp, while he lost his spot at Aston Villa to Manchester United loanee Marcus. Ironically it's United who could offer Watkins a lifeline - and striker could do likewise for the Reds.",
      "He may be 29 and he may be valued at £60million - a figure that would surely need to be reduced for United to step in and do a deal - but he is a proven Premier League goalscorer with the attributes Ruben Amorim wants from his central striker.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has failed to convince in the past two seasons and the Dane would benefit from time out of the limelight, while Joshua Zirkzee was never an out-and-out frontman and is more suited to a number 10 role.",
      "Watkins offers the perfect mix of a willing runner, goalscoring instincts and an ability to lead a line. His athleticism and finishing mark him out while his aerial ability is far better than he is given credit for and ranks him among the league's best for headers won.",
      "The former Brentford man is also a willing presser, a hard worker and an intelligent footballer. He knows when to press and when to wait, when to exploit space and when to time his effort, when to strike and when to come short.",
      "When he was coming through the ranks at Exeter, his then-teammate Jacob Butterfield used to talk to him about Cristiano Ronaldo and how to isolate defenders. Watkins listened and learned, a theme of his career from a non-league spell at Weston-Super-Mare as recently as 2018, to international duty.",
      "His preparation is meticulous and his desire to improve has impressed countless coaches and teammates. Amorim wants hungry players who are capable of slotting into his system and Watkins fits the bill.",
      "United cannot and should not be paying the £60m Villa have as a valuation given his age and the relative lack of re-sale value, but if the Reds can drive that figure down then bringing in a talent such as Watkins seems a natural move.",
      "He's the right side of 30 and has the ability to hit the ground running. United have moved for potential as much as the present with many of their signings under Ineos but if the Reds are to move the dial and secure a return to the upper echelons of the Premier League, they have to focus on the here and now.",

      "“So, if you look at wages to turn over headroom, and obviously wrapping that up into UEFA and squad cost, it’s plausible.",
      "“The bigger question is, again with Spurs, how much are his wage demands, what does he want, and you’ve got to factor that into the long-term contract position before you’ve even engaged on a fee.",
      "“It’s one of those where Spurs could afford it in the long-term, and they’re going to have Champions League money as well to boost that in the season that we’re coming into, but it’s whether or not they really want to outlay a significant amount of wages on that kind of player, and then the fee over the top.”",

      "“Yes, David, who is joining Juventus now, was asking for a substantial wage packet, but he was on a free transfer.",
      "“Personally, I believe the David situation reminds me of Marcus Thuram – similar situation where he was available on a free transfer, but the Premier League clubs were unmoved, but then he went to Italy and was a huge success and we see teams even now being linked with him for £50/60million.",

      "Since his subsequent loan move to Aston Villa, it's believed Rashford and Amorim have not conversed and there has been no movement on a proposed sale either. It looked likely that, for the first time since the winter window move, the duo were going to be in the same building on Monday.",
      "When Raheem Sterling was stripped of his number by Enzo Maresca at Chelsea last summer, that was seen as disrespectful and the 30-year-old does not have the same legacy at Stamford Bridge as Rashford at Old Trafford. United pride themselves on treating academy graduates well when they eventually move on, but this might come back to haunt them if Rashford can't find another club.",
      "Barcelona and Bayern Munich are showing an interest, but United need those teams - or others - to come in and make Rashford an offer before he returns to Carrington. Barcelona is the England regular's dream choice and after Nico Williams committed his long-term future to Athletic Bilbao, that deal could still happen.",
      "For the time being, though, United are stuck in a position where they could be forced to reintegrate Rashford into their squad. That can't be allowed to happen, and so United know what they need to do - sell Rashford quickly and avoid potential headaches if he returns."

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has, reportedly, set an impending deadline for the club to finalise a deal for Viktor Gyokeres - who is admired by Manchester United.",
      "United have been linked with a move for the Sweden striker, 27, since Ruben Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford last November. The Portuguese head coach is keen to bolster his attacking options this summer after underwhelming performances from Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "After missing out on the Premier League title, Arsenal are looking to improve their own attack to close the gap on the league leaders. Several potential targets have been identified, including RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, but Sporting Clube de Portugal's Gyokeres seems to be the standout choice for Arsenal.",
      "According to reports, they are nearing an agreement for the Sweden striker after settling personal terms. Talks are ongoing with Sporting - who are said to be holding out for a fee of around €80million (£69m) for their prized asset.",
      "While negotiations progress, Arteta is reportedly pressing for a swift conclusion. The Mail argue that the Gunners head coach wants a new striker signed before the squad depart for their pre-season tour, in Singapore, on July 19.",
      "The bulk of the discussions will need to be wrapped up in the week starting July 14, giving Arsenal a tight window to finalise the details of the transfer.",
      "Sporting's president Federico Varandas has recently commented on Gyokeres' situation.",
      "He stated: \"Sporting is calm regarding this matter. Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Gyokeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "\"However, we remain sensitive to Viktor's dream or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.\"",
      "Varandas continued: \"Today, there is a strong likelihood he will leave. I won't disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for £60m plus £10m.",
      "\"He won't leave, absolutely not. In recent weeks, we have been paying attention. I saw a player, Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go for £65m, and I saw Matheus Cunha move to Manchester United for about 75m euros.",
      "\"We are talking about players who are 26-years-old. I believe Viktor could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world, which I don't believe, as his agent is one of the best in the world.\"",
      "Gyokeres has bagged a sensational 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting - a goal record that has seen interest accelerate for his signature. However, the Sweden international is yet to finalise a move from Portugal."

      "Of the imposed unconditional €11million (£9.5million) total fine, €5million (£4.3million) is for failing to comply with football earnings rules. The other €6million (£5.2million) is because of breaching squad cost rules (SCR).",
      "It is the second straight year the club is sanctioned after receiving a £50,000 fine for the alleged late submission of their 2023/24 season financial information in the Conference League. Villa also face a conditional €5million (£4.3million) fine per year for the next three years should any further breaches happen.",
      "All clubs face a reduced spending-to-revenue ratio this term. SCR caps \"spending on player and coach wages and transfers and agent fees\" at 70% of a club's revenue this year, down from 80%.",
      "They will be in the Europa League this coming campaign after missing out on consecutive seasons as a Champions League club because of a 2-0 final-day defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Newcastle United instead qualified by finishing fifth due to their superior goal difference.",
      "The total wages from Villa's most recent set of accounts for 2023-24 are £252million, compared to a revenue of £275.7million. That works out at over 90% but does include non-football staff, which UEFA discounts when calculating SCR based on a calendar year.",
      "Villa will likely have to reduce their wage bill this summer. Philippe Coutinho completing a permanent move to Vasco da Gama, as confirmed on Friday, will help toward that.",
      "As reported by Birmingham Live, Emiliano Martinez is one of the club's top earners and is a player they could possibly involve in a 'big sale' before turning 33 in September. However, it is said there will be no fire sale. United are linked with the goalkeeper and Ollie Watkins."

      "On Friday evening, it emerged that the 27-year-old has ‘informed’ Man Utd of his desire ‘to leave’ this summer.",

David Ornstein says Arsenal is keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. Welp.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Tino Livramento – Newcastle to Manchester City\nAn £80m offer from City has been reported, and they do need a new right-back, even if Matheus Nunes is improving there.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",

      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Not £50million, which was apparently Spurs’ opening low-ball offer.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. And Berta, evidently, hasn’t sufficiently seduced the striker’s agents. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca like Luis Diaz but Liverpool are either keen to keep the Colombian or they will only sell for money Barca don’t have. Which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "13) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. But reports this week suggest Watkins is now at the top of their striker list.",
      "",
      "12) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "9) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more before a deal is done next week.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo. But Rodrygo might be too pricey; Williams seems to be staying in Bilbao; and Eze could be signed separately. Romano reckons more talks have taken place, but seemingly not between the clubs.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United. Reports suggest United are confident of getting a deal before next week.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry bagged 11 goals last season.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London almost a fortnight ago to complete his move, but if we know anything about Arsenal this summer, it’s that they won’t be rushed."

      "Apparently there are 20 teams in the Premier League. Who knew? And if that’s true, we should probably go ahead and reassign the best of the rest to the Big Six. And Newcastle United; they’re filthy rich and qualified for the Champions League, so we know about them.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi to Liverpool\nPoor Crystal Palace. This is what happens when you recruit wisely: you eventually get all the nice things ripped away from you.",
      "Their first player to go is their captain, who’s been strongly linked with Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle United, and Arsenal. With just one year left on Guehi’s Palace contract, a summer sale looks pretty likely.",
      "The FA Cup winners might believe holding on to Guehi and losing him on a free transfer is the way to go, but we’re not so sure. Either way, Sporting CP defender Ousmane Diomande has been mooted as the England international’s replacement, which is very smart business, assuming they can pull it off.",
      "Liverpool’s interest is strong amid uncertainty over Ibrahima Konate’s long-term future, and Guehi playing alongside Virgil van Dijk is a frightening prospect for the Reds’ Premier League rivals. They’d form a perfect mix of aggression, reading of the game, and composure on and off the ball.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins to Manchester United\nFor a while, it looked like Watkins to Arsenal was inevitable. But now the Gunners are prioritising Viktor Gyokeres, who has been targeted by United as well. This means the Red Devils are considering the England striker, and even though he’s at an age (29) where big clubs might ignore his talent, their interest makes perfect sense.",
      "He’s yet to score fewer than 11 goals in a Premier League season and also provides a terrific number of assists for a centre-forward: eight last season after a league-high 15 in 2023/24, and six on top of 15 goals the year before.",
      "Scoring 75 goals in 184 Premier League appearances is a fantastic record for an English striker unfortunate to be playing in the same era as Harry Kane.",
      "Aston Villa are a fantastic club and in a much better state than Manchester United, but This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About Here. Watkins deserves to make that move, join the 100 club and hopefully win some trophies (something he’s still wanting to do so). Bless him.",
      "Oh, and not to mention that he would make United so, so much better.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze to Arsenal\nThe odds of this transfer happening are getting shorter by the day, and what a signing it would be for Arsenal. Eze is a delightful, likeable footballer, which would make a move to the Emirates hard to stomach for many people. He and Bukayo Saka aren’t enough to pass the Gunners off as likeable for rival fans while Mikel Arteta is in charge.",
      "Crystal Palace losing their best player and captain in the same summer would be disastrous, but given its likelihood they will have a plan in place, and if a club is capable of adapting to such drastic changes it’s them. They’ll never find themselves in relegation trouble — especially with Oliver Glasner in charge — and have the eye for recruitment that will help fans sleep easily.",
      "Eze would add a lot to an Arsenal side that struggled with their creativity last term. Martin Odegaard was not himself and there was nobody there to pick up the slack, playmaking-wise. Declan Rice did everything he could, but it was not enough with his fellow midfielders and attackers underperforming.",

      "",
      "Murillo to Chelsea\nThe 22-year-old Brazilian ticks plenty of boxes: left-footed, strong in duels, comfortable progressing the ball out from the back, and still young enough to develop further. He’s exactly the kind of player Chelsea have been all over in recent years.",
      "Murillo was one of Nottingham Forest’s standouts in a fantastic 2024/25 season and is a clear upgrade on some of Chelsea’s centre-back signings in the Todd Boehly era. Two left-footed centre-backs might not be the most traditional pairing — and that’s what we’d see at Stamford Bridge, with Levi Colwill an undisputed starter for years to come — but they’d form one of the best partnerships in the Premier League, with a combined age of just 44.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus to Newcastle United\nAnother pretty realistic transfer, Kudus was poor in 2024/25, but then so was the entire West Ham team.",
      "It seems to be between Spurs and Newcastle for the Ghanaian’s signature and while last season was disappointing, his campaign the year before will fill interested clubs with confidence that he’s worth splashing the cash on.",
      "Having assigned Spurs a different player, we’ve given the edge to the Magpies who are, in truth, much more desperate for a player like Kudus.",
      "Eddie Howe needs a new right-winger, even after the incredibly productive season Jacob Murphy just had, which is still baffling. Kudus would be an upgrade and is only 25 years old.",
      "",
      "Morgan Rogers to Liverpool\nThis would be a fantastic move for Liverpool and Rogers, whose ability and potential deserve to be recognised at one of the best and biggest clubs in Europe. To quote Harry Redknapp: “He will go right to the very top.”",
      "He possesses the attributes modern managers love in an attacking midfielder. He has a lovely blend of strength and pace that makes him an elite ball-carrier with end-product.",
      "Capable of playing in the No.10 role and on either wing, Rogers would be an asset for any of last season’s top four and there’s no doubt he’d massively contribute towards a title push for any of those clubs.",
      "",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White to Manchester City\nThere was talk not so long ago of City targeting Florian Wirtz or Gibbs-White as their Kevin De Bruyne replacement. They’ve since signed Rayan Cherki, Wirtz joined Liverpool in June, and Gibbs-White remains a Nottingham Forest player.",
      "Cherki’s arrival from Lyon, along with the signing of Dutch international Tijjani Reijnders, doesn’t mean City are done recruiting creative midfielders. When the initial interest in Wirtz and Gibbs-White was reported, it was said they could sign both. Now, they could well end up with neither — but Cherki is a shrewd addition for £34million.",
      "The England international would cost a fair whack, and even with Forest in Europe, you’d imagine he’d quite fancy to play under Pep Guardiola. Like Rogers, he’s capable of playing as a No.10, a little deeper, or on either wing. He’d be a superb signing.",
      "",
      "Yoane Wissa to Tottenham Hotspur\nIf you’re wondering, Bryan Mbeumo has been ignored because he’s pretty nailed on to go to Manchester United. Although Mbeumo being the player United finally decided to stand firm over and refuse to meet a club’s demands for would be very on brand. He’s actually worth the money, lads. Unlike Mason Mount with a year left on his Chelsea contract, and Antony — who they could’ve signed for half the price a month before paying £80m to Ajax.",
      "Anyway, we digress. New Spurs boss Thomas Frank looks set to miss out on Mbeumo, so could turn his attention to another former Brentford player. Wissa scored an outstanding 19 goals in the Premier League last season and is out of contract next year, so the Bees will be open to selling for the right price.",
      "With Dominic Solanke struggling with injuries, Wissa would be a very savvy addition.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘turn to’ a new striker target, but this potential deal hinges on one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "An ex-Aston Villa striker has labelled Ollie Watkins’ potential move to Man Utd as a step ‘backwards’, saying ‘Villa are playing in Europe, Utd aren’t.’",
      "Arsenal have allowed Takehiro Tomiyasu to leave the club after his deal at the Emirates Stadium was ‘terminated on mutual consent’.",
      "Arsenal are preparing a bid for Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze, with the England international open to a transfer after talks with the Gunners.",
      "Arsenal could ‘wrap up’ a deal for a ‘desperate’ star ‘in the next hour’ as Andrea Berta has been told how he can reduce the transfer fee.",

      "Let’s not beat around the bush: Fabrizio Romano is a character. Love him or hate him, we can’t live without him.",
      "This is a man who screenshot Lamine Yamal’s Instagram story after 18 seconds to post it on his X account. He’s a mouthpiece for agents and has an unprecedented amount of power for a transfer journalist. His word is gospel to so many people, and that fame and reliability make him a perfect tool for players and their representatives trying to engineer a move.",
      "If he posted on X ‘Young talent Jason Soutar is being watched by several top clubs after Dundee contract expiry’, I’d probably be a professional footballer within a week.",
      "He’s got his favourites, too — posting about the same players countless times. Jonathan David instantly comes to mind, and his transfer to Juventus has inspired us to look at some deals Romano has essentially manifested or helped materialise through sheer online presence.",
      "Jonathan David to Juventus\nFabrizio Romano can finally sleep after years of trying to get Jonathan David out of Lille. The Canadian striker got the ‘Here we go’ for a move to Juventus. No fee involved after his Lille contract expired.",
      "David had been perpetually linked with the Premier League, thanks in large part to the transfer guru, who’s been championing his client favourite player for years. He never got his England move but joins a proper European giant in Juve, back to doing what they do best: signing elite talent for free.",
      "MORE: Eight stars *definitely* in Fabrizio Romano’s contact book",
      "",
      "Milos Kerkez to Liverpool\nSticking with summer 2025 and sagas fresh in the mind, Romano was all over Kerkez as he sparkled for Bournemouth, linking him to Manchester United and Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool got their man after United opted for Patrick Dorgu in January. Let’s be honest, picking between the actual Premier League champions and the shambles that is Manchester United wasn’t a hard call.",
      "Romano introduced many of us to Kerkez back in April 2023, when Benfica were keen. It then looked like Lazio, until Bournemouth underlined the power of the Premier League by swooping in and hijacking the deal.",
      "After a brilliant debut season, Romano went into endorsement overdrive — reporting that United “will bring in a new left-back for sure this summer”. Are we allowing Noussair Mazraoui? If not, he was wrong…the FRAUD.",
      "Any goal involvement became an excuse for Romano to boost the Kerkez hype, and he ultimately earned his move to Liverpool. Absolutely deserved, for what it’s worth.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro to Chelsea\nYou might’ve forgotten this, but Romano once gave a ‘Here we go’ for Pedro joining Newcastle United from Watford. What. A FRAUD.",
      "Pedro went to Brighton instead. Newcastle wanted him again this summer. Now he’s at Chelsea.",
      "Romano loves a Brazilian (not that kind) — Joao Pedro, Vitor Roque, Casemiro, Andre, Raphinha. We stopped paying attention to what he was saying about Pedro long ago. He could’ve said ‘Here we go’ to a move to Bikini Bottom and we’d have just shrugged.",
      "",
      "Aurelien Tchouameni to Real Madrid\nBack in 2022, Tchouameni was hot property after bossing Ligue 1 for Monaco. But it was always Real Madrid — as Romano was very keen to tell us. Often.",
      "Romano says Klopp “called” Tchouameni. PSG “made the best proposal”. But nope, the “player only wanted Madrid”. Which we knew. Because he said it 147 times.",
      "Romano’s first post about the Frenchman even ruled out Man United a year early. ‘Manchester United are currently not working to sign Tchouameni… no contacts as of now,’ he tweeted. UTDTrey top of the replies: ‘Don’t know who he is anyway.’ United fans and their transfer team summed up perfectly.",
      "",
      "Jeremie Frimpong to Liverpool\nSurprisingly, Romano didn’t tweet about Frimpong until he was at Leverkusen. Nothing from the Celtic days. Shameful.",
      "Naturally, United were chucked into the mix as Frimpong shone, with Barcelona and Bayern Munich also sniffing around. Romano dropped an exclusive about a new contract, was one of the first to reveal his £34m release clause, and would occasionally repeat the same nothing update just to keep things warm. Classic Fabrizio. We do love you, you know?",
      "A day after saying Frimpong was “one to watch this summer”, Romano reported Liverpool’s interest as a potential Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement. Liverpool being Liverpool, they signed him in four days flat.",
      "",
      "Casemiro to Manchester United\nUnited wanted De Jong. De Jong wanted anything but United. Enter Casemiro.",
      "Romano was on this the second it was viable. Updates came thick and fast as he and United pushed to get it over the line. United got their man. It looked clever for a year, which is decent for them.",
      "",
      "Raphinha to Barcelona\nWhat a saga. Romano wasn’t alone — Matt Law and David Ornstein were in there too — but Romano kept bringing it back to Barca, saying they were Raphinha’s “dream club” and that personal terms were already sorted.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds agreed a fee. Barca had no money. But Romano said they’d “try until the end”, and they did. And they won.",
      "He finally dropped the ‘Here we go’ saying Raphinha “only wanted Barca since February”. Brother, we know. You told us 176 times.",
      "",
      "Mykhaylo Mudryk to Chelsea\nThis saga — January 2023’s finest. The only reason to get up in the morning.",
      "Mudryk wanted Arsenal. Arsenal wanted Mudryk. But Arsenal also wanted to haggle. Chelsea said “money?” and Shakhtar said “yes, please”.",
      "Romano was at his most plugged-in here — borderline on Chelsea’s payroll. Either that, or Todd Boehly was just following Romano’s feed and bidding for whoever Arsenal fancied.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana to Inter\nWhile Onana was dealing with a doping ban, Romano told us he was Inter-bound in a year. Guess what? He was.",
      "Lyon fell through, Arsenal were curious, Inter waited. Romano was patient. Inter got their man. United eventually took the bait. Big mistake.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, an ‘agreement is almost done’ as Newcastle United are ‘closing in’ on their second summer signing.",
      "According to reports, there is a key caveat with Liverpool’s ‘buy-back clause’ with Jarell Quansah as he closes in on a move to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have made a ‘bombshell move’ as they look to sign Newcastle United star Alexander Isak, who is their next ‘top target’.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool will not be breaking their wage structure when they sign Florian Wirtz, as Fabrizio Romano has revealed what he will earn.",
      "The father of a top Liverpool target claims “everything is agreed” for a move to Anfield, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on Florian Wirtz.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has issued a clear update on Liverpool’s attempts to land a top target with a breakthrough made."

      "Despite this, recent reports have suggested that the Villans are open to letting Watkins leave this summer as they look to avoid a breach of the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules.",
      "This transfer is far from guaranteed, though. This is because the deal ‘hinges’ on one ‘pivotal’ factor, with Rasmus Hojlund’s future needing to be settled before Man Utd can move for Watkins.",
      "“If Man United are looking at a good centre-forward to come in and improve their squad, Ollie Watkins would tick a lot of boxes,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“Rasmus Hojlund… a lot will depend on what happens with him, because United probably can’t afford to go out and buy Watkins on top of Mbuemo and Cunha.",
      "“They will probably need to offload a couple of players to allow them the sort of wriggle room they’ll need, with FFP and PSR, to afford a deal for Watkins. I can see them moving for Watkins once they accept a Hojlund bid.”",
      "Hojlund’s form has fallen off a cliff over the past year and he is being heavily linked with a return to Serie A, though it has also been suggested that they could cash in on Joshua Zirkzee instead.",
      "Including Ollie Watkins to Manchester United and Eberechi Eze to Arsenal, we’ve reassigned the Premier League’s best of the rest to the big boys.",

      "",
      "Arsenal: Vito Mannone\nMikel Arteta is obsessed with buying goalkeepers. It’s kind of his thing. So while Arsenal might hope or expect to see a lovely central midfielder or even, bless, their hearts, an actual centre-forward arrive through the training ground doors, pure logic and playing the odds tells us it’s far more likely to be a goalkeeper.",
      "Even though Arsenal already have a very good goalkeeper and have already signed another goalkeeper this summer. That just shows how much they like signing goalkeepers. Even if you count Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus as centre-forwards, then Arteta has still signed twice as many goalkeepers as centre-forwards as Arsenal manager.",
      "Again, using nothing but the very purest and definitely non-mental of logic, that means they MUST sign one more goalkeeper this summer if they wish to procure one number nine. It’s very simple.",
      "Having established that Lille are Arsenal’s favourite club to buy from, how about this for a possible solution to a goalkeeper problem that doesn’t actually exist at the Emirates? Bring back Vito Mannone.",
      "It’s not technically buying from Lille because he’s now out of contract and thus available on a free. But that’s even better, isn’t it? Free! Free stuff can only ever be good news.",
      "And frankly, if your major issue here with any of this is ‘Re-signing Vito Mannone wouldn’t technically be Arsenal buying another player from Lille, actually’ then you should be taking a long, hard look at yourself.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Viktor Gyokeres\nWe know. We’re as surprised as you that this one is actually quite reasonable. It might even actually happen, we haven’t really checked too closely where exactly we currently sit today on the never-ending blows-and-boosts Gyokeres news cycle.",
      "But it is a very on-brand Manchester United signing for so many reasons. Buying a player from the manager’s former club? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker who’s never actually done the business in a top league before? Tick.",
      "The only possible question-mark here is whether, if this did end up happening, United would have ended up paying the full Man United Tax, or merely the more bog-standard Premier League and bidding war tax.",

If football transfers were a supermarket, Spurs would do 73% of their shopping in the middle of Lidl before spunking whatever cash they’ve got left on bullshit ‘picky bits’ from Waitrose.",
      "Lyon are already a club Spurs like to work with, presumably because back when Jean-Michel Aulas was in charge there was a healthy mutual respect between him and Daniel Levy as the transfer game’s two most notoriously difficult bastards. It genuinely is a wonder they ever managed to get a deal done, but we suspect every time they each walked away certain they’d pulled the other’s pants down.",

Even if sometimes they can only borrow them for a bit.",
      "Villa are the social-media influencer trying to project an image of extreme wealth that doesn’t quite match the reality, in a way.",
      "But while missing out on another crack at the Champions League is a disappointment and financial impediment, they can surely still shop at the Everton store for at least one more summer.",
      "Villa are in need of a centre-back with their Other January Loan, Axel Disasi, heading back to Chelsea, so why not Jarrad Branthwaite from their favourite shopping spot? Well, several reasons. But ignore those.",
      "It’s an undoubted step up for a player who might just need it to get himself the attention that could drive greater international opportunities, one that gives him a chance to play alongside some pretty handy defenders and under a very decent manager, all without the greater risks of a move to a fully-fledged giant where the danger of being swallowed up and spat out are very real indeed.",
      "Villa’s foundations may be slightly shaky, but they do remain an ideal ‘next step’ kind of club for players of Branthwaite’s ilk. Big enough and successful enough to definitely not be a sideways step, but without the laser focus and goldfish bowl existence and instant rushes to judgement that come by jumping straight to even loftier ground.",

Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors. And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "Takehiro Tomiyasu has left Arsenal after an injury-ravaged spell at the Emirates. He now takes his place in our star-studded XI of players who have had their contracts ripped up.",
      "",
      "GK: Mark Bosnich (Manchester United and Chelsea)\nThe only player Sir Alex Ferguson signed twice, Mark Bosnich is also the only player in this team to have a contract terminated twice. The Australian goalkeeper didn’t see eye to eye with Fergie and, hours after his Manchester United deal was ripped up, he joined Chelsea.",
      "Around 18 months later, his Chelsea contract was also terminated after he failed a drug test and received a nine-month ban from football.",
      "Fun fact: Bosnich has one goal in 17 caps for Australia, scoring a late penalty in a 13-0 World Cup qualifier against the Solomon Islands.",
      "",
      "RB: Takehiro Tomiyasu (Arsenal)\nA current Arsenal player replaces a former one in Emmanuel Eboue, whose Sunderland termination is pushed out of the door just as he was following a one-year ban in March 2016, three weeks after joining the Black Cats.",
      "News that Arsenal and Tomiyasu would part ways came out of the blue. The Japanese international only played six minutes across the entire 2024/25 campaign after being unable to shake a knee problem. He’s still injured after undergoing surgery and not expected back for at least another five months.",
      "Given his injury woes and long, ongoing rehabilitation, combined with the fact his contract was set to expire next year (with a one-year option), both parties have decided to go their separate ways. It’s a real pity, because when fit, Tomiyasu was a proper asset — capable of playing right-back, left-back or centre-back, and comfortable with both feet. What a shame.",
      "",
      "CB: Gerard Pique (Barcelona)\nNine La Liga titles, seven Copa del Reys, four Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, three Club World Cups, and one Premier League title. What a career Gerard Pique had.",
      "With Barcelona skint and Pique past his best, the player ended up retiring halfway through the 2021/22 season to save the club some pennies. As someone with many fingers in many pies, Pique knew he’d survive financially, though the same couldn’t be said about his former club.",
      "The real reason for Pique’s contract termination was actually because he fumbled the bag with Shakira, but let’s keep that on the down low.",
      "",
      "CB: Daley Blind (Ajax)\nArsenal terminated the contracts of Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis in a short period of time, but for a bit of variety, we’ve included Daley Blind, whose Ajax contract was terminated in December 2022 — six months early. He promptly landed on his feet with a short-term deal at Bayern Munich.",
      "He only played five times for Bayern before joining Spanish side Girona on another free transfer. He’s been very good for the surprise 2023/24 La Liga title challengers.",
      "After officially leaving Ajax, Blind decided to spill the beans on what happened in the lead-up to his exit. “It got to the point where I wasn’t even welcome at the club where I’ve walked around since I was seven,” he said.",
      "“On Dec. 26, the management said they definitely did not want me at the restart of training sessions on the 27th and it came to contract termination.” Ouch. Happy Christmas.",
      "",
      "LB: Marcelo (Olympiacos)\nArguably the greatest left-back of all time, Marcelo left Real Madrid in 2022 to join Greek side Olympiakos, ending a 15-year career in the Spanish capital.",
      "He lasted a lot less time in Greece, having his contract terminated after five months — roughly 1/36th of his Madrid stay. The decision allowed Marcelo to return to Fluminense, the Brazilian side he left in 2007.",
      "Another ex-Arsenal man, Sead Kolasinac, could have been selected here.",
      "",
      "CM: Roy Keane (Manchester United)\nRoy Keane was never short of opinions, and he did not hold back in a notorious MUTV interview after United were hammered by Middlesbrough in 2005 — a game he didn’t even play in. The interview never aired because Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz were furious with their captain’s brutal takedown of his teammates.",
      "Keane insisted he would have said it all to their faces. And you know what? He definitely would have.",
      "It proved the end of his Manchester United career — one of the Premier League’s most dramatic bust-ups. No wonder Fergie hasn’t been on his Christmas card list since.",
      "",
      "",
      "CM: Jordan Henderson (Al Ettifaq)\nFormer Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson lines up alongside his fellow Premier League-winning skipper.",
      "Henderson’s move to Saudi Arabia didn’t go down well at F365 HQ, and it was more than a little irritating to see him waltz straight back into Europe and join a club of Ajax’s stature.",
      "He quickly grew tired of life in the Middle East and made it known that he wanted out. Al Ettifaq reluctantly agreed to tear up his contract, and Ajax swooped in.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Jordan Henderson now facing ‘cash nightmare’ of £85k a week, the poor sod",
      "",
      "AM: Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\nPlenty of question marks still linger over Ozil’s Arsenal exit.",
      "It’s easy to assume he simply fell out of favour under Mikel Arteta as his performances dipped, but there’s likely more to it. His refusal to take a voluntary 12.5% pay cut during the Covid-19 pandemic didn’t help, nor did his criticism of the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China — which Arsenal notably distanced themselves from. That’s a conversation for another day.",
      "Ozil was left out of Arsenal’s Premier League and Europa League squads, and his contract was finally terminated in January 2021 so he could join his boyhood club, Fenerbahce.",
      "That didn’t go great either, in case you were wondering.",
      "",
      "RW: Eden Hazard (Real Madrid)\nFailing at Real Madrid is nothing to be ashamed of. Failing at Real Madrid after joining for £105million with only a year left on your Chelsea deal? That’s a different story.",
      "Injuries, poor fitness, and a general loss of interest plagued Hazard’s time at the Bernabeu. Madrid were desperate to offload his massive wages, and finally did so a year early. A really disappointing end to a fantastic career.",
      "FEATURE: Ten worst big-money transfers ever include Liverpool fleecing two rivals off and worst swap",
      "",
      "LW: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal)\nIt wouldn’t be a contract termination XI without a few Arsenal lads.",
      "Poor timekeeping was the last straw for Mikel Arteta, who cited a “catalogue of misdemeanours” to justify stripping Aubameyang of the captaincy — and later binning him off entirely.",
      "Not long after signing a massive new deal, Aubameyang was released and joined Barcelona. He lasted six months before moving on to Chelsea. Arteta still hasn’t replaced him.",
      "",
      "ST: Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United)\nCristiano Ronaldo made sure his second stint at Manchester United ended in flames by torching everything in a sit-down with Piers Morgan.",
      "His eyebrow-raising digs at the club’s infrastructure, manager Erik ten Hag, and even former teammates like Wayne Rooney gave United little choice but to terminate his contract by mutual consent.",
      "He joined Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League and, aged 40, is still doing what he does best: scoring goals and causing drama.",
      "Arsenal have allowed Takehiro Tomiyasu to leave the club after his deal at the Emirates Stadium was ‘terminated on mutual consent’.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli has emerged as a transfer target for Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr.",
      "Man Utd are responsible for four of the most expensive signings ever of players between the ages of 13 and 36; they later released two of them.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, and they have form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has decided who he ‘wants’ to manage Al-Nassr and they have ‘said yes’ to the move.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona legend Lionel Messi has been ‘offered a blockbuster’ transfer and he has made a decision on his ‘priority’."

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",

      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",

      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
