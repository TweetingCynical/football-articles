      "The departure of Marcus Rashford from Manchester United has been felt deeply, especially after the Barcelona president disclosed that the winger had hoped to retire at Old Trafford. Rashford, an England international and product of United's youth system, left his childhood club this summer for a second consecutive transfer window, joining Barcelona on loan until the end of the season.",
      "The 27-year-old last donned the Red Devils' shirt in December 2024 before being dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby later that month, leading to his exclusion from the first team.",
      "A brief stint at Aston Villa followed, where he showed glimpses of his old form. However, despite returning to Manchester in the summer, manager Amorim remained firm in his decision not to include him in future plans.",
      "In July, the chance to join Barcelona presented itself, with president Joan Laporta expressing his delight at securing Rashford's signature. \"We are very happy because a player of great quality is coming, at a great age to come to Barca with extraordinary motivation,\" Laporta said, as reported by Goal.com.",
      "While praising Rashford's talent, Laporta revealed that the new recruit had dreamt of spending his entire career at United. He added: \"Personally, I've seen how excited he is to come to Barca. One of his virtues is that he is sincere.",
      "\"His dream was to play for Manchester United for the rest of his life. He arrived at the age of seven and was born there. He wanted to be a 'one-club man'. It's nice for a player to say this with all sincerity.\"",
      "Rashford's choice to depart United was undoubtedly devastating for him, but he recognised it was absolutely crucial to revive his career at the highest level.",
      "Whilst he went on to feature in 426 matches for the Red Devils, netting 138 times and providing 60 assists, it remained uncertain whether he'd ever turn out for the club again under Amorim's leadership.",
      "The Portuguese manager may have been resolute in his view that Rashford wasn't a player who would propel his team forward, but it could prove a choice he comes to rue, particularly following his European exploits. Rashford found the net twice in Barcelona's 2-1 triumph over Newcastle on Thursday.",
      "His opening strike, which got him off the mark for the La Liga giants, came via a header in the 58th minute before he unleashed a thunderous effort from distance beyond Nick Pope to extend his team's advantage at St James' Park.",
      "Anthony Gordon netted late on, but it proved merely a consolation with Rashford's double representing his first goals in Europe's elite tournament since October 2021. It was back in 2020 when the England international confessed his desire to only ever play for Man United. \"For me, I never look beyond Manchester United,\" the then-23 year-old Rashford said.",
      "\"As a kid, I've never looked beyond Manchester United. In my mind, it wouldn't sit right for me to be pulling on another shirt. I just want to do the best I can for the club whilst I'm here, so hopefully I'm here for the long-term.\"",
      "Following the triumph against Newcastle, Rashford appeared to rule out any prospect of a United return, declaring: \"I want to stay as long as possible at Barcelona.",
      "\"I have to focus on doing my job, helping the team in any way I can. I can feel the confidence that Flick has given me. I knew he was great before I signed, but working with him is a real pleasure.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Juan Sebastian Veron admits his serious regrets over switching from Manchester United to Chelsea, blaming injuries as his main problem at Stamford Bridge. Numerous footballers have moved from one club to another within the same league, but few have managed such transfers in the Premier League, given the enormous backlash they would encounter.",
      "A recent case would be Alejandro Garnacho, who abandoned his declining role at United to join the Blues this summer. Whilst it appears the Argentinian winger is content with his controversial switch thus far, Veron serves as a prime example of the age-old quote that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.",
      "The midfielder moved to Stamford Bridge in 2003 following merely two seasons at Old Trafford - where the teams will clash later today (September 20). The now-50-year-old arrived at the Premier League powerhouse for a British transfer record fee of £28.1million in 2001, scoring 11 goals across 82 matches and claiming one league title.",
      "Discussing the signing of Veron at the time, Sir Alex Ferguson said: \"I never thought I'd spend this much money on a footballer. I think he's coming into great years of his career and he will peak and we'll get the benefit of that. He is a world-class, fantastic footballer with a vision of a game we can use.\"",
      "However, Veron departed Manchester after a mere 24 months and became one of Roman Abramovich's initial signings as Chelsea's owner. The Blues signed him for £15m, resulting in Ferguson suffering a loss of roughly £13m from their original transfer.",
      "Despite the seemingly sunny prospects in west London, Veron confesses that the move was one of his greatest regrets. Speaking in 2019, the Argentine said: \"At Chelsea, the reality is that I had very little time. I had a major back injury and I was out for practically six months.",
      "\"I was already thinking more about going back to Italy than staying there in England.\"",
      "With only 14 appearances and a single goal to his name, Veron was loaned out to Inter Milan and Club Estudiantes de La Plata before taking a year-long career break. He remained at La Plata following this brief hiatus until his retirement in 2017.",
      "Reflecting on his regret over leaving United, Veron added: \"With United, the truth is that there are few things, very few, that I regret. But one is to have left Manchester.",
      "\"They never pushed me or told me 'you have to go', but they gave me the chance, the possibility.",
      "\"I had talks with my former colleagues at that time telling me that I had to stay. And at one moment I decided to leave because I wanted to play, because I didn't know... I should have stayed.\"",
      "Now, another Argentinian has followed in Veron's footsteps in swapping red for blue, but Garnacho will be hoping that he will have more luck as a Chelsea player than the ex-midfielder.",
      "The former Red Devil is set to face his old club on Saturday evening in the Premier League, with a 5:45pm kick-off at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Saturday's Premier League match offers a chance for Ruben Amorim to relieve some pressure after last weekend's derby defeat. It will be a chance to learn whether his side can benefit from a lack of European commitments, with the opponents coming in off a midweek trip to Munich.",
      "Amorim maintained after that defeat that he had no intention of abandoning his principles. He has averaged just one point per game across this season and last, though, and questions are being asked of the Portuguese.",
      "This weekend will also provide an opportunity for one of United's former stars to haunt his old employers. Alejandro Garnacho has shown promise in a couple of substitute appearances for Chelsea following a summer move, and manager Enzo Maresca confirmed the winger is in contention to start.",
      "Saturday's game is one of three between now and the October international break which could help shape United's season. They travel to Brentford on September 27, and will welcome Sunderland to Old Trafford seven days after that.",
      "Amorim has received a boost ahead of the Chelsea clash, with a couple of first-teamers in contention to play after injury. That's just one of the latest lines as we bring you updates on United's preparations on and off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are both in contention to take to the field against Chelsea on Saturday after missing the Manchester derby. Both picked up injuries in the victory over Burnley, but the setbacks aren't as serious as some feared - though others are still missing.",
      "\"[Diogo] Dalot is out, Mount and Cunha are in the squad,\" Amorim told reporters at his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"[Lisandro] Martinez is still out. I think that is it.",
      "The only other absentee is Tyrell Malacia, who remains on United's books after failing to secure a summer move away. \"Tyrell Malacia is returning to contact with team-mates and the ball in the U21s then we'll see,\" the manager added.",
      "You have to go back to the 1992-93 Premier League season to find the last time Manchester United had as few points as they do now. The slow start has left pundits speculating about Ruben Amorim's future, and former England striker Alan Shearer has suggested defeat this weekend could be the final straw.",
      "\"I don't think they can afford to be beaten [like they were against Manchester City] again this weekend,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager. Something must improve rapidly. Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League.",
      "\"There hasn't been an improvement at all up to now and that can't continue with what they spent. There has to be something that gets them going and if that doesn't happen quickly then everyone knows the rules when it comes to football management.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford reminded Manchester United fans of his quality with a Champions League brace against Newcastle on Thursday night. The England star opened his account for loan club Barcelona, scoring a fine header before beating Nick Pope with an unstoppable effort, as Barca held on for a 2-1 win.",
      "\"That is what I am here to do - to help the team win, but also to try to improve and be the best that I can. It is an amazing experience. I have always been a huge admirer of Barcelona as most people my age have watched them play from when we were younger.",

      "But Amorim's refusal to change his 3-4-3 system, allied to the summer arrivals of forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, means Fernandes has been forced into a role for which he is ill-suited.",
      "Amorim will stick with Fernandes in the deeper role for Saturday's visit of Chelsea to Old Trafford, claiming playing him there gives United more control of possession during games.",
      "“Of course, Bruno wants all the freedom in the world,” said Amorim. “But even when he plays in a No.10 role, he's getting the ball back.",
      "“Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box, but he's getting there and he's near the box and he can do his shots.",
      "“I think it's a position that I want Bruno more deep, to have more possession, to try to control the game more - and we're doing that.",
      "“Sometimes we miss a little bit Bruno in front, maybe because Matheus Cunha was not there. But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player.",
      "“So I'm trying just to balance the team and trying to imagine the game, and we'll try to put the best starting line-up there.",
      "“But I see Bruno well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further forward, but he has a job to do.",
      "“And the important thing is not Bruno playing well. It's the team playing well and winning football games - and he can play in different positions.”",
      "United, who finished 15th last season, have just four points from as many games this season to stand 14th in the table, and have already been dumped out of the EFL Cup by League Two Grimsby.",
      "Asked why United have continued to struggle this season, despite a summer spend of £236million and a full pre-season under him, Amorim said: ”I think it's everything. It's belief. It's confidence. It's aggression. It's everything. “And sometimes, what we call luck is the way you can play the game with more belief. Liverpool are winning all the games. It's something about the teams that are winning that something is going to happen, to have that feeling.",
      "“Sometimes, with us, I feel the opposite. We're playing well, but something is going to go wrong in some moments.",
      "“So we need to change that, but it's just with wins. But, if you look at the goals against City, Fulham, all these moments, we scored against Burnley.",
      "“We are good in the game and then we take a draw [or lose]. All these moments, I think we can do better. It's our fault. So we work on that during the week to improve for the next game.”",
      "Altay Bayindir started in goal for United's 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City last weekend, ahead of new signing Senne Lammens. But Amorim has warned both goalkeepers they will have to fight it out for the No.1 spot this season.",
      "“Nobody has a place that is his place,” said Amorim. “Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what the best option is to win the next game.",
      "“At the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We're just trying to win games, trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.",
      "“The opponents don't have the same amount of opportunities as last season. But in the end, if you don't win, it doesn't matter. So I think it's something mental and we need to change.”",

      "While Ruben Amorim is under increasing pressure at Manchester United, two potential replacements for the head coach have been denied as being considered. Suggestions have been made that club legend Michael Carrick was being sounded out as a possible short-term replacement for Amorim in case of a mid-season shake-up.",
      "There were also whispers of Jose Mourinho making a potential return to the north west prior to his appointment at Benfica this week. Amorim has failed to make much of a mark since arriving at Old Trafford last November.",
      "While a 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season may have been a major cause for concern, the 40-year-old was excused as a result of working with a squad he largely inherited from Erik ten Hag.",
      "But new acquisitions seemingly haven't provided a remedy for poor form, given that Amorim has managed just one win from his opening four fixtures, as well as an embarrassing exit from the Carabao Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town, who play in League Two.",
      "While many fans of the Red Devils will be growing tired of their side's struggles, given just how prolific they were during Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary trophy-laden tenure, the board hasn't given up on their head coach just yet. That's despite rumours that the club have been showing an interest in other managers as of late.",
      "It was suggested that Carrick had been contacted about the possibility of having to replace Amorim in the event of a mid-season sacking, while other rumours claimed that Mourinho was also considered for a return to Old Trafford. However, according to talkSPORT, insiders at the club have firmly denied these two suggestions.",

      "Ruben Amorim has reportedly been given a stern warning that his job hinges on securing European football for Manchester United. The Portuguese coach hasn't had the smoothest start at Old Trafford, leading United to a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season after taking over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "Adding salt to the wound, United also failed to clinch the Europa League trophy, which would have guaranteed their spot in this season's Champions League, making their narrow 1-0 loss to Tottenham in May's final even more bitter.",
      "Despite receiving the board's support and a full pre-season tour to ready his squad for the new season, Amorim's poor form has continued into 2025/26.",
      "The 40-year-old has only managed one victory in the first four matches, coupled with an embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town last month.",
      "While the board have assured that they're not considering sacking Amorim just yet, it is reported that he has been given a clear directive by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "According to talkSPORT, the United co-owner visited Carrington on Thursday and told Amorim that performances on the pitch need to improve.",
      "Ratcliffe reportedly believes that Amorim's current squad has the potential to secure a top-five finish this season, even though Champions League football isn't an explicit goal for 2025/26.",
      "However, it's understood that Amorim has been tasked with securing some form of European competition by the end of the season.",
      "During Friday's pre-match press conference, he quipped: \"He offered me a new contract. No, it was normal things just to show the support, explain it's a long season.",
      "\"This is a club with more pressure maybe than any in the world. Last year I was very critical of the way we played. Now I think we are playing well until the [penalty] boxes. We need to be more clinical. We are in a better place compared to last year but we need to win.\"",
      "United are heading into Saturday's showdown with Chelsea at Old Trafford on an inconsistent run of form. The club suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on the Premier League's opening weekend, before managing a 1-1 draw with Fulham the following week.",
      "Amorim seemed to have hit his stride with a 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break, only to suffer a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium at the weekend, where Phil Foden and Erling Haaland shone. The task ahead is daunting as United prepare to host Chelsea, who have been in impressive form under Enzo Maresca this season, remaining unbeaten in the league with two victories and two draws.",
      "However, morale may be low in the Chelsea squad after their 3-1 Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich on Wednesday, while United have had the benefit of a full week to address any issues from their previous match.",

      "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has aimed a subtle dig at Manchester United ahead of their Premier League clash. The Blues travel to Old Trafford on Saturday evening as they look to bounce back from disappointment in the Champions League.",
      "Chelsea were in European action on Wednesday night as they took on Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. An own goal from Trevoh Chalobah and a Harry Kane brace saw Bayern come out as 3-1 winners with Cole Palmer on the scoresheet for Chelsea.",
      "While Maresca’s men were in midweek action, a lack of European football at Old Trafford this season means that Ruben Amorim’s team have had extra time to both prepare for the game against Chelsea and recover from any knocks in their squad. It could potentially be seen as an advantage going into the weekend’s game.",
      "When asked about the situation during his pre-match press conference, Maresca appeared to aim a dig at United. “If you ask me, I prefer to play the Champions League game, no doubt,\" he said.",
      "“But at the same time, the reality is that they have one entire week to prepare the game. And we played a game two days ago, 48 hours ago. But again, I prefer to play the Champions League games.\"",
      "One person who would seemingly be in full agreement with the Chelsea boss over wanting to see his team in Champions League action is United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. TalkSPORT claim that during a meeting with Amorim this week, Ratcliffe stressed that on-field results need to be improved.",
      "It is added that the co-owner believes that the current squad is now good enough to challenge for a top-five finish this season. Bringing European football back to United next season is seen as essential by United chiefs, although the Champions League is not said to be the essential aim by the end of the season – as much as Ratcliffe will want to see United back among Europe's elite.",
      "Qualification for any form of European football is viewed as the bare minimum for Amorim to get, or he could face serious repercussions.",
      "The lack of European football this season will be a big financial blow to United. Given a big transfer spend in the summer, a return to the European stage this time next season is something that is likely to be expected.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Amorim outlined what was said in the meeting with Ratcliffe this week. \"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" he said with a smile.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",

The Red Devils have had a rocky start to the campaign, with just one victory from their first four league matches - their latest defeat being a thumping at the hands of Manchester City last weekend.",
      "The task doesn't get any easier as they prepare to welcome Chelsea to Manchester. Manager Ruben Amorim is hoping to field his strongest team for the clash, and it seems he may be in luck with a couple of key players poised to make a comeback.",
      "Amorim has confirmed that both Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are fit and ready to play, although Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez remain sidelined.",
      "In his pre-match press conference, he revealed: \"Dalot is out, Mase and Cunha are in the squad. Licha is still out, that is it.\"",
      "Discussing Martinez's recovery, Amorim said: \"It's really important [that Martinez is nearing a return]. When you have that injury you recover a lot of times very fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step.",
      "\"We do miss Licha a lot. We miss the aggression in this moment, how aggressive he is on everything he does, we miss him. But he's always there in every meeting, even in training, he stays there to watch the training... I think we need Licha in this team.\"",
      "Another player who won't be featuring is Tyrell Malacia, who is currently up for sale. Speaking about the Dutchman, Amorim said: \"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see.\"",
      "Enzo Maresca's squad have kicked off the new season on a high note. The Blues remain undefeated after four matches, despite a loss in their Champions League opener against Bayern Munich.",
      "The west London side faced a new worry during their match against the German giants as Cole Palmer appeared to pick up an injury, but he seems likely to be fit for the Old Trafford clash.",
      "During his pre-match press conference, Maresca confirmed: \"Cole is okay. We have a session now, we flew back yesterday. We need to assess some players, we have some doubt. We didn't have a session since Wednesday's game, but we will see.\"",
      "While Palmer appears ready to play, several other players won't be joining him on the pitch. Long-term injuries continue to sideline Levi Colwill and Liam Delap, while midfielder Dario Essugo is also out of action.",
      "Benoit Badiashile and Romeo Lavia are grappling with their own fitness issues and, although they're nearing recovery, this weekend's journey to Old Trafford may come too soon.",

      "Manchester United would've had to fork out £122million to have Gianluigi Donnarumma on their books for the duration of his five-year deal - with the finances involved ultimately motivating them to look elsewhere in the summer.",
      "The Italian was a man on the lookout for a new club when it became clear his time at PSG was up. The Red Devils were offered the chance to sign the highly-rated goalkeeper, who was being forced to leave Paris when his former club refused to entertain his wage demands.",
      "Whilst adding a shotstopper was on United's radar in the summer, they were concerned at the overall cost of having Donnarumma at the club. At 26 he remains in his prime and was seeking a lengthy deal - ultimately landing a five-year contract at Manchester City.",
      "But the Red Devils were originally quoted a fee of £35million to land Donnarumma. His annual wages were then a staggering £17.4m. That is a weekly salary of £330,000, which would've made him the club's highest earner, reports the Telegraph. Across the duration of a five-year deal, that would've been a mammoth £87m.",
      "United believe that the four deals they struck - which include adding Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo - did not go against the market value or the club’s wage structure. Signing Donnarumma would have changed that.",
      "The Italian made a winning debut in the Manchester derby and underlined his quality with a stellar save from Mbeumo in the second-half. United have been criticised for their failure to land the Euro 2020 winner, but they had originally planned to stick with Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton.",
      "Senne Lammens, the young Belgian goalkeeper, was signed for £18m on deadline day, but their long-term planning was again under the spotlight when they allowed Onana to leave on loan. He headed to Turkey with Trabzonspor and United couldn't land a replacement as the window had shut.",
      "Earlier in the summer Ruben Amorim had considered moving for World Cup winner Emi Martinez. However, Aston Villa wanted a fee of £30m and the Argentina keeper’s wage expectations were as much as £10m a year.",
      "United remain scarred by their constant transfer failures of the past, which have largely come about because they overpaid for players and pursued individuals regardless of their age. Those blunders made an impact on their finances and left the club with a number of players who were difficult to shift given their hefty wages and the length of their contracts.",

      "\"So we are happy with the way he has adapted to our style and what we want from the winger. I think he is ready to start.\"",
      "Estevao Willian, however, is a player who requires more time to develop. \"Estevao can be great in all of the attacking positions,\" Maresca conceded when asked about his potential. \"His talent is very good, he is a top player, but he is 18. He needs time.\"",
      "Maresca, meanwhile, confirmed that Marc Guiu remains part of their plans. \"The reason why he is back [from being on loan at Sunderland] is because we intend to use him,\" the coach said. \"He needs to do things better and improve things, but for sure, we are going to use him.\"",

      "A perfect header and a rasping long-range effort at St James' Park underlined the quality Rashford has in his locker, which he struggled to produce on a regular basis at Manchester United, leading to his loan moves to Aston Villa last season and then Barcelona on a season-long deal. It’s been almost a decade since Rashford’s stunning first Premier League appearance.",
      "Having scored twice off the bench in a Europa League victory over Midtjylland, Rashford was deployed from the start by then-manager Louis van Gaal. It proved to be one of the better decisions of the Dutchman’s tenure as Rashford scored twice to really announce himself to English football.",
      "Another United youngster made his Premier League debut that day in February 2016, James Weir, who came on for Ander Herrera in the 89th minute. His career went a very different direction from Rashford’s. He left for Hull City at the end of that season after captaining United’s under-21 side to the Premier League 2 title.",

The England star produced a brilliant display for Barcelona in Thursday's 2-1 triumph over Newcastle United in the Champions League.",

If you see the number of shots, the xG, all these things are good, but if you don't score, or win games, it doesn't matter. Then, again, I said after the last game, the way we suffer the goals, we can avoid it. We are being naive and we need to be more aggressive to win games. We just need to maintain how we are playing, with improving in the opponent's box and our box.

      "United have had a free week as a result of missing out on European football last season, and the Portuguese head coach will be hoping that freshness will stand them in good stead for the clash with Chelsea this weekend.",
      "Amorim knows he's under pressure to determine results, having spent heavily in the summer transfer market. Although the window closed at the start of September, United are still being linked with a number of potential signings ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Central midfield is expected to be the next position the Reds target, with the likes of Ruben Neves, Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton all linked with a move to United in recent weeks.",
      "We will cover all the latest transfer news and rumours, plus any further developments on Amorim's future and other more general club updates with our live blog below.",
      "Finances were reportedly the primary reason United chose not to pursue the deal.",
      "The Telegraph claims the club simply couldn’t afford him - given the quoted transfer fee of up to £35m and wage demands of around £17.4m per year (£330,000 per week).",
      "This would have pushed the total cost over a five or six-year deal to more than £130 million - a figure United were unwilling to commit to for a single player, especially one who would instantly become the highest-paid in the squad.",
      "Man United are reportedly one of three clubs interested in Camavinga.",
      "Chelsea and Newcastle United are also claimed to be interested in the France international, who has been valued at €80m (£70m).",

      "According to TEAMtalk, Ruben Amorim will be given financial support to target the Nottingham Forest midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "Strengthening the midfield is expected to be a key priority for the club in 2026. The Reds have also shown interest in Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton, although reports suggest a move for Wharton is unlikely.",
      "Ruben Amorim joked that Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe offered him a new contract when he visited the club's training complex on Thursday.",
      "Ratcliffe has been defensive of Amorim's record at United, claiming in March that the Portuguese was doing \"a great job\". Amorim has won only eight of his 31 Premier League games in charge.",
      "Amorim was reassured by Ratcliffe that his position is still secure. Amorim is under contract at United until the summer of 2027.",
      "The United head coach also discussed the state of play at the club with chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox. Amorim opined that United \"are playing well until the boxes\".",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport claims Man United have been touted as a possible destination for Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic with the Serbian's contract set to expire this summer.",
      "The striker has been in fine form this season, scoring a brace for the Old Lady in their thrilling 4-4 draw with Dortmund in the Champions League.",
      "The newspaper claims Vlahovic is expected to leave Juve when his contract expires, with Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Old Trafford possible destinations.",
      "The Telegraph say 'would still be a surprise if United do not attempt' to sign Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Amorim's side reportedly made an approach to the Seagulls for the midfielder in the summer, but Brighton wanted a fee close to the £115 million they got from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo, something thet United couldn't afford.",

      "The United boss is also slowly integrating 23-year-old goalkeeper Lammens, who arrived from Royal Antwerp for £18.2m including add-ons, into the side by sticking with Altay Bayindir. Many Reds fans have been itching to see Lammens enter the sticks, with Bayindir struggling this season.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho's brother was sitting in the Old Trafford directors' box and burst into tears when his sibling crossed the white line for his Manchester United debut against Chelsea in April 2022. No tears were shed over Garnacho's departure to Chelsea.",
      "Garnacho and his on-off girlfriend, Eva Garcia, made several trips to London throughout last season. One of Garnacho's agents, Enrique de Lucas, played for Chelsea and De Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro were at Stamford Bridge in January.",
      "Some have speculated that Miss Garcia could return to England now that Garnacho has relocated to the capital. It is a transfer he was warming up for as far back as the winter window.",
      "Come his final participation as a United player in Hong Kong, Garnacho was sullen and contemptuous of the post-season tour. He fulfilled the post-match meet-and-greet commitment at Hong Kong Stadium but Garnacho never broke into a smile for the selfies.",
      "He looked happier to be away from the club, revelling in the attention from a paparazzo in Hale in July. At Carrington, Garnacho was persona non grata, albeit not the only one as a member of the five-man bomb squad.",
      "Although Garnacho was in the United academy from the age of 16, he never seemed likely to be a one-club man, having arrived from Madrid. His association with the club ultimately lasted less than five eventful years, beginning with a period of quarantine due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Garnacho was isolated again in his final months at the club.",
      "Garnacho vacated his Cheshire mansion earlier in the year but was still forking out for the rent while he resided in downsized accommodation. United were keen to stress at the time that Garnacho's change of residence was unrelated to a future transfer and that his parents and brother had returned to Spain.",
      "Another move was inevitable when Garnacho was omitted from the Europa League final starting XI. He should have seen it coming. Ruben Amorim used the Friday night fixture away to Chelsea as a dress rehearsal, with Mason Mount starting and Garnacho on the bench.",
      "Garnacho naively thought nothing of it. He had his hair bleached for the showpiece in Bilbao. At San Mames stadium, a disconsolate Garnacho was the only United player on the pitch when the teams were announced. He distracted himself by catching up with former teammate Sergio Reguilon.",
      "In less than a year, Garnacho's status was downgraded from untouchable to undependable. During a press conference on the post-season tour, Amorim started chuckling when Amad was asked if he hoped that Garnacho could somehow end up staying. The dye had been cast for the bleached blond.",
      "\"Garnacho is not our player,\" Amorim said on Friday. \"I’m really happy with Mason and (Matheus) Cunha returning. The rest you have to talk with the Chelsea manager.\"",
      "When pressed on Garnacho in the second section, Amorim started laughing again. \"Guys, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who plays for the opponent, what people are going to say in the end, if the other player is going to play well. They are good players and they will play well if things happen.",
      "\"I'm just focused on winning the game. That is my only concern.\"",
      "The 2022 FA Youth Cup final was one of Garnacho's most celebrated evenings at Old Trafford. A record crowd of 67,492 for the competition was present for United's first triumph in the competition in 11 years.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo recorded a motivational message for the squad that was played in the dressing room before kick-off. Garnacho, who idolised Ronaldo and mimicked his celebrations, scored twice in the 3-1 victory.",
      "As United players took it in turns to pose with the trophy, Garnacho draped the Argentina flag around him and there was the first rendition of \"Viva Garnacho\" from the Stretford End. Garnacho offered some cursory applause and afforded himself a quick smirk amid the impromptu adoration.",
      "He was never fazed by the hype or the demands. Garnacho was immortalised on the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year plaque at Carrington and angled for the number seven shirt after his first season. It went to Mount, also cursed by the number. Garnacho got a seven in his new upgraded squad number of 17.",
      "Without him, United would still be on 12 FA Cups. Garnacho was worthy of the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award in 2023-24, a campaign that he indefatigably played through without succumbing to injury. He played 50 times and started in 38 in succession. Garnacho has been injury-free since March 2023, a remarkable stretch for a winger who is a magnet for hatchet men.",
      "His performance against Liverpool in that quarter-final for the ages was not one of Garnacho's best but he had a pivotal role in all four goals. Garnacho had been managing a hamstring injury in the days leading up to the tie and played more than two hours in the epic, collapsing deliriously when Amad steered the ball past Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Unlike some other wingers, Garnacho never went into hiding. He always demanded the ball and had a work-rate reminiscent of David Beckham. Consider the added-time comeback against Brentford in October 2023, a game that possibly spared Erik ten Hag of the sack 12 months early. It is the game-changer Garnacho who twists and turns on the byline before diverting the ball in for Scott McTominay to eventually equalise.",
      "Garnacho's immediate reaction is to sprint back into his own half. There is time for a winner. It is that attitude and those memories that make his brief time in the United first team (his full debut was less than three years ago) so regrettable. He was a throwback to the United wingers of yore yet also a modern winger",
      "Maybe there was too much, too young. Garnacho's overhead kick at Everton and celebration against West Ham United were central to the script for the stirring Adidas Originals trailer fronted by Barry Keoghan to launch last year's white away shirt.",
      "Like Marcus Rashford before him, Garnacho did not appreciate having his nose put out of joint by a new manager. Ten Hag read Garnacho the riot act a couple of times over some tardy timekeeping on his first pre-season tour and a passive-aggressive reaction on social media. But the dynamic changed irrevocably under Amorim.",
      "Player and manager tried to make it work after Garnacho and Rashford were dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby last year. Amorim felt Garnacho was inattentive when he issued him instructions at Viktoria Plzen three days earlier. Rashford never played for United again. Garnacho was back in the squad and back on the pitch four days later at Tottenham.",
      "Whereas teammates had tired of the Rashford drama, they were more invested in the younger Garnacho. Bruno Fernandes took Garnacho under his wing but was also prepared to clip Garnacho's wings. He unloaded at him over Chelsea's winning goal in May.",
      "Arsenal, Tottenham and Atletico Madrid backed off on possible moves for Garnacho after conducting due diligence. One of his most accomplished performances for United was at Chelsea, overshadowed by their extraordinary stoppage-time implosion from 3-2 up to 4-3 down in April 2024.",
      "At £40million, Chelsea got Garnacho on the cheap. United attempted to portray the transfer as a positive, that Garnacho was the club's fourth-highest sale. He left for £2.5m more than Omari Hutchinson, the former Ipswich Town winger who joined Nottingham Forest.",
      "United are going through a change of identity, most glaringly with the absence of pure wingers in their starting XI. Amorim has seen off Garnacho, Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho. Garnacho is the only one who could be missed, though his antagonistic attitude should ensure some boos back at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The United academy is quick to pat itself on the back when there is a first-team breakthrough yet they are conspicuous by their absence if problems surface with a graduate. Garnacho, Rashford and, most gravely, Mason Greenwood have all caused strife at United. Club sources admitted Garnacho's loudmouth brother, Roberto, was a problem.",
      "Garnacho's transgressions were the most frivolous yet United need to buck the trend of academy poster boys developing an inflated sense of entitlement before they have turned 21.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur in May, midnight was looming and the skyline pitch black. Garnacho emerged from the dressing room sporting some shades and walked through the mixed zone without breaking his stride.",
      "Amorim was sat at the front of the team coach. Garnacho removed the sunglasses before he boarded it. He would not have been concealing tears over his impending exit.",
      "He wanted it.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim suggested even the Pope could not change him to pick a different formation.",
      "Amorim has used the 3-4-2-1 system in all 47 matches he has taken charge of at United but the team have won only eight out of 31 in the Premier League.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited United's Carrington training complex on Thursday but there was no puff of white smoke. Ratcliffe reassured Amorim after a galling start to the season in which United have won one of their five matches and were humiliatingly eliminated from the League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim will continue to use the 3-4-2-1 system he swears by in United's Premier League home fixture against Chelsea on Saturday night and clarified he does not intend to change United's shape now.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" Amorim replied when asked if the formation was mentioned with Ratcliffe. \"No one, not even the Pope will change… This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.",
      "\"But I will change the system, there will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying, 'you need to change the system' and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way.",
      "\"So, everything, when you think about the impact that any decision is going to have on the team, everything is important. So, I will say the same thing: this will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way.",
      "\"But it will change. So, I hope to have the time to change! But it will change.\"",
      "Amorim expressed encouragement at United's performance progression, citing their second-place status for the expected goals metric. United are first for most attempts at goal and efforts that have hit the woodwork in the Premier League.",
      "However, United have scored one goal from open play in six hours in the league so far this term. Apart from Bryan Mbeumo's second-half strike against Burnley, United have scored two own goals and Bruno Fernandes converted an added-time penalty to beat Burnley.",
      "Champions Liverpool have won all five of their league and Champions League games with a goal scored in the last ten minutes or in added time. Amorim feels Liverpool have the belief United are lacking.",
      "\"I think it's everything,\" he opined. \"It's belief. It's confidence. It's aggression. It's everything. And sometimes, what we call luck is the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"So I think it's Liverpool. It's winning all the games. It's something about the teams that are winning that something is going to happen, to have that feeling. And sometimes, with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well, but something is going to go wrong in some moments.",
      "So, we need to change that, but it's just with wins. I can do whatever. They can do whatever. But, if you look at the goals against City, Fulham, all these moments, we scored against Burnley. We are good in the game and then we take the draw.",
      "\"All these moments, I think we can do better. It's our fault. So, we work on that during the week to improve for the next.\"",
      "Amorim was fleetingly linked with a return to Lisbon as Benfica manager early in the week. Reports in Portugal suggested Benfica presidential candidate João Noronha Lopes was keen on bringing Amorim in to replace Bruno Lage, who was sacked after the Champions League defeat to Qarabag in midweek.",
      "Instead, incumbent Benfica president Rui Costa appointed Amorim's mentor and former United manager, Jose Mourinho, as Lage's replacement. Former Sporting coach Amorim clarified that there was no contact with Benfica and that whenever he leaves United he will require a break.",
      "\"No guys, no contact,\" Amorim added. \"I'm Manchester United manager. Until something changes, and after that, for sure, if it's next month, tomorrow, in ten years, I will rest because I deserve it.",
      "\"So, no contact, not so ever. And then Mourinho is there. So guys, if you want, you will have fun!\"",

      "Before taking on the role at the club co-owned by himself, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, and Gary Neville, Giggs managed the Wales national team and led them to Euro 2020 qualification. However, he missed the tournament after stepping down from his position in November 2020.",
      "Giggs, who was succeeded by Robert Page as Wales manager, later described it as a 'heartbreaking' moment to miss out on leading the team at the Euros, which had been delayed by a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "\"I had the stint as Wales manager and loved it,\" he said back in January. \"Eventually I’d like to get back into management. On matchday I still get as excited as ever, probably more than ever.\"",
      "Giggs, along with fellow Class of '92 members Nicky Butt, Scholes, and Phil Neville, was bought out by Beckham and Neville, who led a new consortium to complete a takeover of Salford in May.",

      "Manchester United will take on Chelsea in the Premier League this evening.",
      "United suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in the Manchester derby last weekend, which means the Reds have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim increased after the loss to Grimsby Town and it has cranked up again. There are three games before the October international break and they will be crucial for Amorim.",
      "United must bounce back against Chelsea when they visit Old Trafford. The London club lost against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday, and United have the advantage of fresh legs.",
      "Regarding the team news, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are available, but Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are still sidelined.",
      "This is how our writers think United should start the game:",
      "United are not going to get anywhere with Altay Bayindir and Luke Shaw in their team. Senne Lammens and Harry Maguire should come in, as unlikely as that is.",
      "Amorim has to persevere with Manuel Ugarte in midfield with Bruno Fernandes. Given the magnitude of the game and the opposition, Mount is worth recalling in the hope that he rises to the occasion against his former club. Cunha also has to come back in.",
      "It is worth playing Amad on the left as he is a far better player than Patrick Dorgu. Noussair Mazraoui would provide balance on the opposite flank.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "The next few games before the October international break could decide whether Amorim is given more time. Amorim must get his team selection right and it would be beneficial to decide on a settled XI.",
      "I would bring Lammens in for Bayindir, who was shaky again last weekend, and Shaw should also be moved to the bench. Maguire was good last season and should become a regular starter again.",
      "The midfield is not working and it's time to play Kobbie Mainoo. Ugarte banked some credit at the Etihad, but it makes sense to partner Mainoo with Casemiro, as they have previously excelled together.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Fernandes would be my front three, with the latter on the left side. It feels wrong to leave Cunha on the bench, but he's only just returning from a muscle injury.",

      "Enzo Maresca will sit down for a chat with Alejandro Garnacho to determine whether he is mentally ready to play against Manchester United.",
      "Garnacho completed a £40million transfer to Chelsea in the last week of the summer transfer window.",
      "United included a 10 per cent sell-on clause in the deal, with Garnacho becoming the fourth-highest sale in the club's history, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria.",
      "Garnacho is a United academy graduate and scored in the 2024 FA Cup final, but the circumstances that led to his exit to Chelsea have left a sour taste in the mouths of some supporters.",
      "The 21-year-old's relationship with Ruben Amorim gradually broke down last season. There were concerns with Garnacho's discipline throughout his time at the club and his social media activity irked fans.",
      "That means Garnacho could be booed when he returns to Old Trafford on Saturday evening.",
      "“Probably it is something that we have to think about,” said Maresca when asked about the narrative surrounding Garnacho’s return to Old Trafford.",
      "\"First of all, because he is young, so you don’t know how he can react. But also in case we decide to start with him, I will have a chat with him to ask also how he feels about that.”",
      "Maresca was unsure whether returning to a former club shortly after leaving could fuel a positive performance.",
      "He said: “It can be in both ways. It can be in both ways, but I think we have also another similar case, like Jadon [Sancho] last year, that for different reasons struggled.",
      "\"Then he joined us for one season, it was good, he helped us to achieve our target. Overall, I think Jadon had a good season with us and hopefully Ale' Garnacho can have the same.”",
      "After signing for Chelsea, Garnacho penned an emotional goodbye to United fans on Instagram, saying: \"Dear Manchester. After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I’m very grateful for this.",
      "\"To the coaches, staff, and my teammates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had.",
      "\"I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what’s to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",
      "United completed the signing of Garnacho on a free transfer from Atletico Madrid in September 2020 and after progressing in the academy and winning the FA Youth Cup the youngster became an established part of the first-team squad.",
      "Garnacho left United having scored 26 goals in 144 senior appearances.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United do not have an outright number one goalkeeper.",
      "United signed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day for £18.2million, including add-ons, and the 23-year-old was on the bench for the Manchester derby.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started in all four of United's Premier League matches this term, having arrived for £4.3m from Fenerbahce as back-up to Andre Onana on deadline day in September 2023.",
      "United allowed Onana to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan earlier this month, leaving them without a clear and obvious first-choice 'keeper.",
      "When asked whether Bayindir was the new United number one, Amorim replied: \"No, nobody has a place that is his place.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko is yet to break his duck for United after five games. Sesko made his full league debut in the 3-0 loss at City after failing to score in two starts for Slovenia in their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "The 22-year-old was the tenth outfield player to take a penalty in the 12-11 shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round, though he was suffering from cramp at the end of the 90 minutes.",
      "Sesko said during the international break he needed time at United. The former RB Leipzig striker is three months younger than his predecessor, Rasmus Hojlund, who managed three goals in his final 35 appearances for United before he joined Napoli on loan.",
      "United have had the most attempts at goal in the Premier League this season, have hit the woodwork more times than any other team and Bruno Fernandes has created more chances than any other player.",
      "Amorim acknowledged that Sesko was too isolated in the derby. \"I think, if you remember Arsenal, I think we missed a lot. Burnley, I think we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, I think we missed a lot. We have four games and I said three.",
      "\"And then there is the thing that you say is not a big opportunity. The first play (against City), Amad has the ball between the lines. It's four against three and we put the ball out. It's not a big opportunity. It should be. So all these things.",
      "\"But if you ask me, against City, Sesko looks like he's alone in the box, I agree. He was always alone. So the guys were around, near the box. But in the final third, we get there many times.",
      "\"But I also said that, I think, in the end of the game. When I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. So I think it's not the same team in that department compared to last year.",
      "\"He's at a different club. He's taking it all in and he's a professional. So you can feel that. He wants everything for tomorrow and we have to balance that.",
      "\"But he's doing the job. And again, guys, we can talk about all the things here. The system: if one ball goes inside the box, we win one game and two, this will change.",
      "\"The important thing is that last year, I said to you, I think I was really clear: we cannot play well. We cannot create chances. This year is completely different. We can avoid all the goals that we are suffering. Yes, it's our fault. So let's work on that and try next week and next week and next week.\"",

      "Peter Schmeichel believes Ruben Amorim was wrong to suggest Manchester United need to sack him if they want change.",
      "Speaking after the Manchester derby defeat, Amorim was asked whether he would change his approach after United's worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/1993.",
      "Amorim responded: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "United's head coach has stuck by his system, but Schmeichel thought Amorim made a mistake in his post-match press conference because he 'put himself above the club'.",
      "In an interview with Sky Bet, Schmeichel reacted to the Manchester derby defeat, which increased the pressure on Amorim's shoulders at a time when he needs to secure positive results.",
      "Schmeichel explained: “You always have to look at what the manager’s job is; you’re employed to win football matches. At Manchester United, that also means winning trophies, and right now he’s not doing that.",
      "\"His win percentage is around 36%, which is the worst performer of any United manager since World War II. Sticking by his guns obviously isn’t working. Bruno Fernandes said after Sunday’s game that it’s very difficult to play in midfield when you’re always one man short, because you can’t cover the ground.",
      "\"The system might look good when it works, but it hasn’t worked yet. And I don’t think the system itself can be the most important thing. For me, the art of coaching is to get the maximum out of the players you have available. Right now, it’s clear not all of them are playing to their potential.",
      "\"They look confused, sometimes disorganised, especially at the back. That’s where the manager has to take a look and change something.",
      "“I say this because I was at United during a rebuilding phase, when we were moving towards winning trophies and the Premier League. Certain standards were always in place.",
      "\"The main one was simple - no one is ever bigger than the club. That applied from the manager down through the players and staff. If someone tried to go their own way and it didn’t work, it couldn’t continue.",
      "\"That was drilled into us every single day. Sir Alex Ferguson gave us a framework that was very simple and easy to understand. It started with not conceding goals, and then it was about recruiting players who could both defend under pressure and take risks going forward.",
      "\"Guys like Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, myself behind them, Paul Parker and Denis Irwin as attacking full-backs. It worked because it was simple, and because of the mentality and quality of the players.",
      "“Right now, I don’t think we’re getting the quality out of the players we have. They can do more. The manager has to change his ways. I didn’t like what he said the other day – 'If you want change, you have to change the coach'.",
      "\"I like him a lot, I like his leadership qualities, and he came in during a very difficult period with unwanted players and dealt with it well. But as a Manchester United person, I don’t like that sentence. That’s putting yourself above the club and I don’t like that.”",
      "Schmeichel continued: “You only have to look at Sunday’s game at Manchester City to see how unhappy Bruno Fernandes was. He can look frustrated at the best of times, but this was different – he was really unhappy.",
      "\"And understandably so, because Manchester United were outnumbered in midfield throughout the game. The thing about Bruno is simple - why do we have him? Because he’s a world-class player on the ball.",
      "\"He creates, he spreads play, he scores goals. But you don’t score goals from deep. I’d much prefer to see him higher up the pitch. He’s never been a number six, he hasn’t got the legs for it, and it’s unfair to ask him to do that job because it takes away from his real strengths.",
      "“Now, I know people sometimes complain about former players being critical, and I hold my hands up – I’m one of them. But I’ve been there. I know what it takes, how much you have to invest, how much you need to be at 100% in everything you do.",
      "\"Nobody likes criticism, but this isn’t personal. When we talk about these things, it’s about suggesting what could make it better. It comes from love for the club, not for the headlines.",
      "“Bruno is the captain, and he speaks for the players, so of course it’s uncomfortable when there’s this kind of debate – but it’s necessary. United have new people in charge – Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Christopher Vivell – all of them new, without deep Manchester United knowledge.",
      "\"That’s why voices like mine, Roy Keane’s, Gary Neville’s, Paul Scholes’s matter. We’ve been there, we understand what it takes, and when we see things going in the wrong direction, it’s important we speak up to help, and at least make the people in charge think about it.\"",

      "The England international, now 27, was frozen out by United head coach Ruben Amorim - who signed off on a loan spell to Aston Villa last January and the temporary move, with an option to buy, to Barcelona. It also demonstrated Rashford still considers Fernandes to be an ally at Old Trafford.",
      "The United captain has been a loyal servant to Amorim - who is the one that might have ended Rashford's career at Old Trafford for good. Meanwhile, Rashford's decision to also repost Sancho's Instagram story also demonstrated he is still showing solidarity with the winger.",
      "While it was Erik ten Hag who decided to send Sancho on loan to Chelsea last summer, Amorim did not try and reintegrate the ex-Borussia Dortmund forward into his plans upon his return. Sancho was also quickly confined to the 'bomb squad' with Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, before he secured a loan move to Aston Villa.",
      "After the match, Rashford admitted he couldn't be happier playing under Hansi Flick's exciting Barcelona team. He said: \"It's going good, learning a lot, it's a new way of football but I'm enjoying it all - and I think that it's making me a better player.",
      "\"So that's what I'm here to do, I'm here to help the team win but improve and be the best I can.",
      "\"I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona - people my age have watched them from when we was younger - amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.\"",
      "When asked to explain his thrilling second goal, Rashford added: \"It was a split second, I seen [saw] the far post, I thought I'd get a shot off.",
      "\"When you're going away from goal it's difficult to generate the power to keep it low, I thought try to aim high and I knew when I caught it, it would take some doing for the 'keeper to stop it.\"",
      "Rashford's display against Newcastle followed his performance in Barcelona's recent 6-0 demolition of Valencia - where he whipped in a fine assist for Raphinha to score. He will now be eyeing up the Catalans' next clash against Getafe on Sunday, September 21 (8pm).",

      "\"If you're playing the same way week in, week out, the opposition, and especially with all the technology and everything nowadays, you can go out on the training pitch and you set yourself up to do well against a team. That's why I feel he's got to be a bit more flexible.",
      "\"Most top teams in the Premier League now are nearly always playing with a back four and so for me, if you’re playing with four at the back instead of three, you can mix it up a little bit more as well.",

      "\"Why he was underrated is because the United fans were not pleased that he fell out with Sir Alex and then he went to Inter and he came back and played for Liverpool, so all the Man United fans didn’t like that, a Man United player who's done really well going to Liverpool.",
      "\"I definitely do (think Mainoo could be the next Ince). When I heard that Mainoo might be leaving the club, I was really against it. I think he's a real talent. Last year, he had quite a few injuries and couldn't get going but the year before that, he was outstanding and he looked as if he had great potential.",
      "\"As long as he keeps his feet on the ground and works really hard at it, he could be a really good player. I know he's more attacking but Mainoo can do the defending if you put it on him, and that's what he's got to do.",
      "\"He's got to get his overall game a little bit more established and then I think he would go really well with Bruno being the more advanced midfield player.\"",
      "Last season was stop-start for Mainoo due to a few small injuries and concerns about where he fits into Amorim's system. Amorim played the midfielder in different positions, even using him as a false nine.",
      "Mainoo relocated to the deeper midfield role in pre-season this summer, but Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a start.",
      "The youngster subsequently requested to leave on loan in the final days of the window, which was denied.",

      "Manchester United may seemingly already be putting plans in place for the January transfer window. One area of the squad has been the subject of plenty of speculation following the defeat to Manchester City in the Manchester derby.",
      "United may have signed three new forwards, a left-back and a goalkeeper during the summer transfer window, but a lot has been said about the need to sign a new midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba was heavily linked with signing for United, but a move never materialised with the Seagulls reportedly demanding a fee in excess of £100million for the Cameroon international.",
      "With the summer transfer window now closed, a fresh report has now emerged claiming that United are interested in Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves. A report in the Daily Briefing has claimed that a €20million (£17million) deal could be on the cards with Neves apparently keen to return to Europe.",
      "This is not the first time that United have been linked with signing Neves. Reports first emerged back in 2018 claiming that United were interested in signing the Portugal international during his time at Wolves.",
      "Neves signed for Wolves in 2017 and helped the club secure promotion to the Premier League, before eventually playing a key role in helping the Molineux outfit also qualify for the Europa League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Neves made 253 appearances for Wolves, scoring 90 goals, and has since featured 60 times for Al-Hilal since making the switch to the Saudi Pro League back in 2023. A move for Neves now would come seven years after United were first linked with the midfielder.",
      "United would certainly benefit from a new option in midfield. What will be key is how determined United are to sign Baleba, and if they have a realistic chance of getting a deal over the line.",
      "If the answer to that is 'no', then the club will consider their options - and links to Neves may stick around. Neves has already outlined his desire to return to his former club Porto before he retires.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he said last month.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",
      "\"I used to go to the Aliados to celebrate Porto's titles but now I want to be on the other side and want to see my family celebrate.\"",

      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",

      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",

      "What started out as a tactical game in which the hosts stifled their more illustrious opponents, the game was decided two moments of real quality from Marcus Rashford especially the second goal which was so like Gabriel Batistuta’s thunderbastards at Fiorentina in the 90 and early 00’s.",

      "So what is it that makes players become better once they leave the Theater of Dreams? I think it has a lot to do with the culture.",
      "Management guru, Peter Drucker is credited with making this famous quote; culture eats strategy for breakfast. And that quote would suffice for this short discussion.",
      "Since Alex Ferguson left, Manchester United has failed to continue their unbroken streak of success despite spending billions of pounds and hiring several managers.",
      "No matter the personnel, the story has remained the same; a comatose giant unable to scare opponents.",
      "Looking at the Red Devils former rivals, Arsenal brings this quote in sharp relief. That quote is an encapsulation of the idea that no matter how well crafted the strategy is, it will fail if there is an absence of an excellent culture at the organization.",
      "When Mikel Arteta was hired in 2019, Arsenal were in a terrible shape. Quite similar to where Manchester United is now.",
      "From a toxic and indifferent dressing room, to a divided and hostile fanbase to a beleaguered boardroom who were tentative in action, the club was in a mess.",
      "Handed the reins of a big club as your first job must have been the best impression of being thrown into the deep end.",
      "However the evidence of what an incredible job Arteta has been able to pull off at Arsenal is shown by the number of managers who have tried and spectacularly failed at Manchester United. Even the great Jose Mourinho couldn’t fix the club.",
      "I am certain that apart from his tactical acumen and excellent talent ID, the singular most important thing that Arteta changed at Arsenal was the culture.",
      "Although many have mocked his non-negotiables but those values where useful in stemming the rot and cleaning the Augean stables.",
      "He has made Arsenal quite difficult to beat. All the players fight for him and majority of the fans are behind him. Even the board notorious for being parsimonious have loosened the purse strings to cater to his yearnings for a more robust and deep squad.",
      "And he made it look so easy that many club boards have been deceived to think that to get their teams playing an expansive and attractive type of football, all they have to do is to hire a young manager and give him time.",
      "Someone said that if Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko were at Manchester United and Arsenal respectively, the former would have scored a grand total of 0 goals while the latter would have scored 3 or more goals by now.",
      "I am of the firm opinion that the culture and environment at Manchester United is inimical for players and coaches to flourish and until the culture is revamped, no amount of money spent on hiring playing personnel would reverse their fortunes. Just look at Marcus Rashford against Newcastle. He was barely recognizable.",
      "As for Mikel Arteta, hats off to him.",

      "However in the very fabric of our game, we use the word chance, which is defined to luck rather than skill. Every single opportunity, we call a “chance” and (certainly in my lifetime that I can remember) we always have – because we never assume someone will score, least of all a 35 yard beauty dead-ball, because we know that Johnny GreatFootballer isn’t perfect. However, I am also aware that luck – is defined as being completely without one’s actions so willing to concede luck is really not the right word to convey my point without disparaging anyone’s ego or sense of self.",
      "So I apologise for being noisy, and confusing matters, but I also do think that there needs to be a distinction on a win reliant on a moment of genius or madness – so I put it to the commentariat, what can we call that word? I would like to motion the word “Serendipitous”. It’s a lovely word, a bit of a mouthful, but far less inflammatory than luck.",
      "It was serendipitous for Liverpool to win 5 games after the 80th minute in a row, no? And it was serendipitous that despite both teams really not looking like ever scoring, our man Dominik (sp?) stepped up and did the business, yeah?\nHarold Ezekiel Hooler\nP.S: I am really sorry, Sarah, and I remain grateful for the time you’ve afforded me in the mailbox this week (and always) as I try to explain my flubbed logic. I will now shut up, I promise – I’ll be a good boy",

      "“This isn’t sustainable! Liverpool cannot keep scoring in the final minutes!”",
      "You can hear them foaming at their mouths. But they are right, Liverpool cannot keep scoring in the last minute. So, in the next game, we will score in the 15th minute, the 26th, the 37th and the 55th instead.",
      "If anything, Liverpool are the UNLUCKIEST team in the world. To attack and play positive football, only to be hindered by rustiness, misplaced final pass, post, bar, miskicks, lowblocks by billion pound teams, ball out of play for more minutes than in-play, the list goes on.",
      "Every team we played so far has tried to negate us instead of playing football. Newcastle was long-balling from minute 1, Arsenal played 4 CBs and 3 DMs, Burnley put 10 men in their box AT HOME, and Athletico is a Simeone team. Bournemouth is the only team that played some football, and despite these ‘tactics’, we won all our games. Every team has a right to play the kind of football they want, but it is unfortunate the first 5 Liverpool games are of this ilk and of course, it is not as fluid and beautiful as a normal football game can be. The next few games, Everton and Palace will continue the low blocks and bastardery.",
      "So sure, our football is a little disjointed and clunky but let’s blame the other team as well, playing every anti-football tactic in the book. I look forward to the Chelsea away game, where Chelsea cannot play a defensive game at home, right? Right? Keep laughing, keep throwing shade, keep calling us a waste of money, we’ll quietly collect the points over here while you fiddle.\nVP21",

      "It was even reported that Baleba was keen on the move, thus proving that their pull remains, but this deal was too good to be true as Man Utd could not finance a deal after investing around £200m on overhauling their attack.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man City, Liverpool, Ollie Watkins, Ruben Amorim",
      "Man Utd’s ‘dream’ move for Baleba was certainly ambitious, but it has a far greater chance of happening next year, once he and a No.6 is their overwhelming transfer priority, and it has already been reported that they ‘will return’ for him in 2026.",

      "This further cemented the Reds as a leading global superpower and it gives head coach Arne Slot a near-perfect squad, which has only a couple of weak spots.",
      "One such area is at centre-back, which will be fixed once they land long-term target Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, while the absence of quality competition for Ryan Gravenberch in the No.6 role is another issue.",

      "This is why their reported interest in Baleba makes a lot of sense, with a report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claiming Man Utd are ‘shellshocked’ at the very real possibility of missing out on the Brighton standout to Liverpool.",
      "Jones explained to TEAMtalk: “Manchester United were the first club to make a move for Baleba in the summer and they still see him as a key target for their long-term rebuild under Amorim. There was intent behind that approach, wanting to show the player and club how serious they are.",
      "“But the concern is that Liverpool’s admiration could turn into something more concrete.",
      "“They’ve already shown this year they’re not afraid to splash out big money on the right player, and if they decided to push for Baleba, United would suddenly find themselves in an unwanted situation. No one wants to go head-to-head with Liverpool – on or off the pitch.”",
      "As Jones says, “no one wants to go head-to-head with Liverpool” on the pitch or at the negotiating table.",
      "Given the state of each club, it would be a no-brainer for Baleba to choose the current Premier League holders over Man Utd, who face the nightmare of seeing a perfect signing head to their biggest rivals and to be left chasing their tails for a far less suitable alternative.",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",

      "When a manager enters ‘X number of games to save his job’ territory, he rarely emerges from it on firm ground. Ruben Amorim has reportedly been given the next three matches, but the first of that pre-Anfield run on Saturday feels more decisive than the two that may or may not follow.",
      "United welcome Chelsea to Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Despite the sh*tshow that has unfolded since Sir Alex Ferguson left, the Red Devils have never lost to the Blues at home in the Premier League under all the managers that followed. Should Amorim become the first, the writing won’t be on the wall so much as highlighted in illuminous marker and ringed in red.",
      "He could not claim to have not had the time to prepare for what’s coming. The slither of positivity, should you squint to see it, from their European absence was said to be all the time Amorim would have with his players on the training pitch.",
      "United will have had Monday to Friday to work on the flaws ruthlessly exposed by Manchester City in the derby. As Amorim suggested, the Red Devils enjoyed more control at the Etihad than they have on most of their visits in recent years. The manager’s problem, though, is control means little without the moments. And the flaws they demonstrated at key times cannot really be fixed in a single working week.",
      "That isn’t enough time to impart upon Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro or Kobbie Mainoo the freakish mobility necessary to cover all the ground required of midfielders in Amorim’s system. It is definitely not long enough to turn Bruno Fernandes into a No.6, not that any coach in their right mind should ever want to.",
      "Nor is five days enough to give his players the confidence and technique necessary to make the moments matter. City, in both boxes, definitely did. Which leaves United’s belief in themselves, but more worryingly their manager’s methods, shredded before Chelsea turn up.",
      "Fernandes was candid when after the derby, as ever, he faced the inquest interviews. The skipper admitted United were too easy to outnumber in midfield, especially when the centre-backs are not feeling ‘brave’ enough to jump out and help.",
      "That would have been music to Enzo Maresca’s ears had the Chelsea boss not already spotted the bleedin’ obvious.",
      "Maresca’s whole schtick is creating overloads in the exact areas the Red Devils are vulnerable. Without some tweaking to Amorim’s precious system, even subtly, it is hard to envisage how Cole Palmer won’t find the space to make United dance to his tune.",
      "But Amorim will not change. We know that because he has freely told us so on a twice-weekly basis. And so defiant he has been over sticking to his principles, he would be harshly judged for changing them now by the exact people who have lobbied him to do so.",
      "Chelsea, though, have yet to show the consistency that might have Amorim pre-emptively packing his bags before the weekend. They play in fits and starts, and while Maresca comes to terms with juggling his many, many players around a heavy workload – in stark contrast to United – there remains too great a difference between what they are capable of and what they often produce.",
      "Their set up, while posing opponents many problems in possession, does offer up opportunities, especially on the counter. If United can muster up just a hint of the ruthlessness they have lacked so far this season, they ought to get the chances to showcase it.",
      "Without that, and a midfield solution that no-one outside Carrington can foresee, Amorim might not make it to Brentford, let alone Liverpool.",

      "Man Utd can demand a sizable fee for Mainoo as he is under contract until 2027, though this reported price is higher than the £40m they requested in the summer.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The most surprising thing is that the player himself is not going through the best of times at United. This situation has caused discontent in the player, who, according to various reports, has already expressed to those close to him his desire to change teams in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "‘Even so, Manchester United doesn’t seem willing to facilitate his departure. The English club’s strategy is to leverage the midfielder’s contract, which runs until 2027, to secure a multi-million-dollar transfer. Real Madrid, aware that it needs new blood for its midfield in the medium term, has made it clear that it will consider the deal, but always within financial parameters they consider reasonable.’",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",

      "Ruben Amorim is doomed at Manchester United as he’s been set an ‘ultimatum’ that everyone was aware of before this afternoon’s ‘exclusive’ was released…",
      "As usual, Amorim and Ratcliffe have been in the headlines as the INEOS chief has ‘flown in’ to hold ‘talks’ with the Man Utd head coach.",
      "This comes amid a dire start to the 2025/26 campaign for Man Utd, who look no better this season than they did in 2024/25 as they sit 14th after four games.",
      "Their situation is not helped by Amorim still refusing to budge from his favoured 3-4-3 formation, despite it being clear for all to see that it is not working and doesn’t suit this group of players.",
      "All indications are that Amorim is bullishly insisting that his tactics are not the problem, even though he suggested on Friday that his side is “playing well until the boxes”, which indicates a pretty major flaw regarding system and/or personnel.",
      "Alan Shearer reckons Amorim will continue to stick to his current tactics and “die on his sword” at Man Utd, and it’s hard to look past this being the outcome of his sorry saga at Old Trafford.",

      "First of all, it is pretty bold of talkSPORT to label this as an ‘exclusive’, because everyone knows that Man Utd’s minimum aim in any season is to qualify for some European competition, with this especially the case following another summer of huge spending.",
      "This is just common sense, but it does mean that Amorim is doomed, as a seismic change brought about by a change of formation and/or a couple of marquee signings in January is required to give Man Utd any hope of anything more than back-to-back bottom-half finishes in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim and Man Utd would have a greater chance of achieving an upturn in results and performances if there is a transition to a far more suited 4-2-3-1 formation, as the head coach is yet to come close to getting the maximum out of this squad.",
      "However, Ratcliffe’s assertion that this Man Utd side is ‘capable of a top-five finish’ is naive beyond belief and exposes his lack of know-how.",
      "The squads of Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are far superior to Man Utd’s, while they can also make a strong case that Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are better.",
      "So Man Utd may have earned ‘record revenue’ despite themselves, but the frailties of Amorim and Ratcliffe leave them miles behind their main rivals on the pitch, and there is more pain to come before INEOS gets the club back on an upward trajectory on the pitch.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",

      "Ferguson wasn’t to know Mark Hughes would continue playing top-flight football well into his late 30s but the Welshman’s experience and grit may have come in handy during the 1997/98 campaign. Eric Cantona’s retirement, Teddy Sheringham’s initial struggles as his replacement and captain Roy Keane’s season-ending injury saw the Red Devils lose their Premier League crown to Arsenal.",
      "Hughes also showed Marcus Rashford how to do it at Barcelona.",
      "",
      "Keeping Dean Henderson rather than spending a fortune on Andre Onana seems like a better idea in hindsight, but we wouldn’t have all those compilations of the Cameroonian’s c**k-ups if that happened.",
      "",
      "Letting go of Phil Neville when he remains an immutable fixture on the England ladder was foolish of Ferguson, but the legendary Scottish boss will perhaps have more regrets about letting so many of his other unwanted stars rock up at Goodison Park. Neville, Tim Howard and Darron Gibson all featured for Everton in the bonkers 4-4 draw that cost United top spot in the 2011/12 season. If he kept Chris Eagles as well, it definitely would’ve been seven titles in a row.",
      "",
      "Would Dimitar Berbatov have kept David Moyes in the Old Trafford hotseat if he didn’t leave for Fulham in 2012? Almost certainly not, but the Bulgarian would’ve come in handy considering Robin van Persie missed a large chunk of the 2013/14 season.",
      "",
      "Gordon Strachan’s trip across the Pennines would’ve hurt Ferguson after his fellow Scot helped Leeds pip the Red Devils to the title in 1992, but Johnny Giles’ departure to Elland Road in 1963 seems a bigger mistake. Giles was still in his early 20s at the time and went on to become one of the finest midfielders in Europe under Don Revie.",
      "",
      "There haven’t been many direct transfers between England’s two most successful clubs but Fred Hopkin’s story is one that stands out. Hopkin left Man Utd for Liverpool in 1921 and was an ever-present in the side as he helped his new team to the First Division title in his maiden season.",
      "",
      "Denis Law’s back-heel didn’t actually relegate Man Utd, so it’s got to be Carlos Tevez. The Argentine forward helped the Red Devils to two Premier League titles, an EFL Cup and a Champions League triumph in his short stay at Old Trafford. However, Tevez then ended up on the blue side of Manchester and despite going on strike in the 2011/12 season, he returned to help deliver a first top-flight title to City since 1968.",
      "",
      "Playing for the red and blue sides of both Manchester and Merseyside is unusual but what’s even more bizarre is Ron Atkinson’s decision to let a young Peter Beardsley go so soon after signing him. One of England’s finest players in the late ’80s and early ’90s, Beardsley was behind the likes of Whiteside, Stapleton and Macari in the pecking order at Old Trafford, but given his ability to be far more than an out-and-out marksman it remains a mystery that he only featured in one match for the Red Devils.",
      "",
      "One of Newcastle’s shiny new toys for this campaign, but two years ago Anthony Elanga swapped Old Trafford for the City Ground. If Amorim does end up getting the boot, one of his potential replacements may wish they had a £50million winger to aid their cause.",
      "",
      "Another seemingly odd decision by Atkinson was to let an established defender who came up through the youth system go. Jimmy Nicholl went on to win multiple trophies up north with Rangers after his brief spell on Wearside and he was yet to turn 30 by the time Ferguson arrived at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "After winning the lot with Man Utd Teddy Sheringham returned from whence he came and enjoyed two more seasons at White Hart Lane before joining Portsmouth for their 2003/04 campaign. That season was of course famous for Arsenal’s Invincibles, with the Gunners taking the Premier League crown away from Old Trafford in style. The only two clubs they failed to beat in their historic run: Man Utd and Portsmouth, with Sheringham finding the net in a 1-1 draw at Highbury and almost inflicting defeat on Arsene Wenger’s men but for a very questionable penalty.",
      "",
      "A goalscorer for Man Utd in their 1977 FA Cup win over Liverpool that prevented Bob Paisley from winning the treble 22 years before Ferguson, Stuart Pearson was a firm favourite with the Old Trafford faithful and if it wasn’t for persistent knee problems he may not have left for West Ham in ’79. Despite dropping down a tier, Pearson’s FA Cup story wasn’t over as he set up Trevor Brooking for a famous Wembley winner in the 1980 final. Meanwhile, the Red Devils exited the competition at the first hurdle.",

      "Although he did call Rashford a ‘boy, masquerading as a 27-year-old’ who ‘even makes Grealish seem like the soul of sobriety’ and is ‘viewed by some managers as too much of a risk, too toxic’ in July. So that lesson must have been recent. Thursday evening, maybe?",

      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has hailed his “refreshing” loan move to Barcelona after scoring twice in a 2-1 win over Newcastle on Thursday night.",
      "The Red Devils allowed Rashford to join the Catalan giants in the summer transfer window after spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Rashford was clearly lacking in motivation at times under Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim with the Portuguese head coach claiming in January that he would rather play his goalkeeping coach over the England international.",
      "He didn’t explode into life at Barcelona immediately, with rumours that the Catalans could terminate his loan early, but his two-goal display at St James’ Park on Thursday showed Barca fans what he can do.",
      "On Rashford’s situation at the Camp Nou, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said on his YouTube channel: “And just to finish guys on Manchester United and on Barcelona, we have to touch on the Champions League night. And in this Champions League night, the big face on one side of Manchester, of course, is Erling Haaland, who scored 50 goals in 49 Champions League games.",

      "“And so Rashford starts performing for Barca and imagine the deal compared to Hojlund is completely different. For Hojlund, the 50 million euros are almost guaranteed. For Rashford is a loan with a buy option close at 30 million euros.",
      "“But the feeling is that now Rashford is already making an impact at Barcelona, man of the match, two goals in these important Champions League night, replacing Lamine Yamal in the best way possible. So Barca are very happy with Rashford.",
      "“Barca are happy with the attitude. Barca are happy with Rashford as a professional bars are happy with how Rashford is doing his very best to adapt to new city, new country, new league, new football, new club, new coach.",
      "“Everything is new for Marcus Rashford spending the whole career at Manchester United, and now his process of adaptation, and the club is doing very, very well. The club is very happy.",
      "“A few weeks ago, we had reports of Barca considering to terminate early the loan of Marcus Rashford, I told you here on the channel, complete bulls**t, completely fake.",
      "“Now you can see how Rashford is performing, how Rashford is already becoming an important player for Barcelona, and these two goals in a crucial Champions League night from Barcelona are already a perfect message coming from the player.”",
      "“Honestly it’s an amazing experience, I’ve always been a huge admirer of Barcelona. Most people my age have watched them play from when we were younger, so it’s amazing football, amazing players and we just want to win as much as possible.”",
      "Rashford added: “I’m full of excitement. I’m very motivated, very determined and the quality we’ve got in the team, that excites me alone.",
      "“It’s refreshing to play with these guys. I’ve said it a few times but the team’s so young, they play with such confidence, such understanding of the game.”",
      "On Barcelona boss Hansi Flick, Rashford continued: “He’s a top coach, top man manager and he’ll be delighted today,’ said Rashford of his boss. ‘With the three points and the confidence that the team showed, believing in the way we wanted to play.",
      "“Most goal kicks, they’re pressing so high and we’re still trying to play from the back, the times we got out we looked like a positive team and with the quality we have we can always make things happen.”",

      "There are times when the title of this feature can seem bitterly ironic, but this weekend is not one of those weekends. This really is another Big Weekend on the back of last weekend, which was also very much a Big Weekend.",
      "This Big Weekend is one that could quite conceivably end with either Arsenal or Man City or indeed both an uncomfortable distance adrift of Liverpool even at this early stage, while all eyes will once again be on Ruben Amorim and his weirdly admirable ongoing insistence on denying objective reality. It’s a tactic we might all like to consider in these troubled times. Much easier than the alternative.",
      "And another Premier League weekend arrives with the really big question: will this finally be the game where Aston Villa score a goal?",
      "What if they don’t score a goal, though? What if they just never score another Premier League goal ever again? What then? Is there a plan in place for that?",
      "We don’t know.",
      "",
      "Assuming, as assume now we surely must, that a day earlier Liverpool have scored a preposterous late winner in the Merseyside Derby, this becomes an uncomfortably hefty early game between what are very likely the only two teams capable of giving the champions a problem over the course of the whole season.",
      "Neither would probably be choosing to play the other at the end of a weekend when the scoreboard pressure could be absolutely huge.",
      "If Liverpool have beaten Everton, then the scenarios in play involve either both these teams being six points adrift already, or City slipping nine points off the early pace, or Arsenal being five off the running and City eight away.",
      "It does very much feel like a game that might be most easily enjoyed by Liverpool fans basking in post-derby glow than either of the teams actually involved.",
      "But even without the whole ‘bollocksing up the title race in mid-September’ hoopla, there is still much to commend this fixture.",
      "That’s been true for a good few years now, since Arsenal managed to shake the habit of getting slapped silly every time City turned up.",
      "And last year Mikel Arteta even managed to shake off his usual big-game timidity to hand out a fearful thrashing of their own, with all the wonderful ‘stay humble’ saltiness that followed.",
      "Worth remembering also that that particular Arsenal statement of intent in the title race was followed by managing only one win from their next four games against Leicester, West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United.",
      "There’s a draining emotional heft to this fixture that both teams could probably do without just as the real two-games-a-week business kicks in, and every chance that no matter what happens at the Emirates the real winners are to be found at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Liverpool have played five proper competitive games of football this season. In three of those games they have eased themselves into a 2-0 lead, promptly p*ssed said 2-0 lead all up the wall, and then just gone and scored a ridiculous late winner anyway.",
      "It’s a fantastic bit, and long may it continue. It’s so rare for the best team in the country to also be the most fun to watch, and we should all try to cherish it while it remains the case here.",
      "The reason, most obviously, the best team is rarely the most fun is because the best team in the country is, almost by definition, unlikely to be one prone to repeated acts of nonsense. Liverpool certainly weren’t like this last season, and we much prefer this season’s approach as a neutral.",
      "The best team in the country might be the most electric going forward, or the most reliably secure at the back, or even both. But rare indeed is the season where the best team look simultaneously so vulnerable yet so inevitable.",
      "And with this newly impish, Jack Grealish-inspired Everton side looking far more capable than most Toffees of recent vintage of exploiting those Liverpool vulnerabilities we really could be in for a classic Merseyside derby.",
      "Just don’t whatever you do miss the last few minutes.",
      "",
      "It’s now one goal in his last 11 Aston Villa appearances for a striker Villa desperately need to start firing and soon.",
      "Sunderland away wouldn’t have been a fixture that filled Villa fans with dread when the fixture computer spat out its findings back in June, but a lot has changed since then. The Black Cats have two wins from two at home, and Villa need to find something soon to avoid this season spiralling into something truly unpleasant.",
      "They are still, preposterously, yet to score a single league goal a month into the campaign, crashed out of the Carabao at the first attempt – although there was at least a goal in that one, so progress, we guess? – and from next week have the added workload of European engagement to consider.",
      "It’s not that uncommon for a player to be in some need of the cliched one-to-go-in-off-his-backside at this stage of the season, and Watkins is very much there. But it’s something a bit different when a whole team is waiting for some buttock-based goalscoring good fortune to kick start an entire season.",
      "We mustn’t be too dramatic. We’re not yet in a Fear For Them situation with Villa, we really aren’t. But if this weekend goes wrong then it’s going to get harder and harder to ignore the warning signs.",

      "As he will be now pretty much every week until either a) he’s sacked, b) Manchester United become consistently and convincingly quite good on a semi-regular basis or c) the boiling seas rise and claim us all.",
      "What’s really fun is that right now our money is firmly on c).",
      "Last season, we’d have said that Chelsea at home wasn’t a bad fixture for an under-pressure United and their Beleaguered Manager. One of the quirks of last season was that United – before and after Amorim’s arrival – were very good at sorting out the dreadful relegated teams and perfectly capable of summoning up some kind of dormant muscle memory of their glorious past when faced with any of their former rivals.",
      "They could be relied on to put up a decent show against your Liverpools, your Arsenals, your Man Citys and the Chelseas of this world as well as beating the very worst teams; it was the vast array of teams in the middle that United had problems with seemingly every single time.",
      "But this season they have already celebrated a played-quite-well-actually cup when losing 1-0 to Arsenal and been thoroughly outplayed in the end by Manchester City in the derby.",
      "We’re not yet quite sure about Chelsea this season, either, with an inconsistent start after their Club World Cup antics suggesting they might not quite be the title contenders we thought they could be.",
      "They really should be able to sort out United, though, possessing as they do exactly the kind of game-controlling midfielders Amorim so conspicuously lacks and all manner of tricky, clever forwards capable of exploiting the ongoing confusion that reigns within a defensive structure where, if anything for me, Clive, United sometimes have too many players back with the result that nobody’s quite sure who’s supposed to be doing what.",
      "We know by now that Amorim isn’t going to change. He will live by his back three and die by his back three, with the only question really just how overtly he will attempt to goad United into handing him that lovely £12m pay-off if/when it does all go wrong again against another team United used to consider a major rival really not that long ago.",
      "",
      "Fourth meets sixth at the King Power in what already feels like a pretty significant early clash between two key promotion contenders, with Leicester yet to truly convince or stamp their obvious class on the division since dropping back into it.",
      "Coventry, meanwhile, remain unbeaten yet have foolishly concentrated far too many of their division-leading 15 goals into two big daft wins when they could have been far more usefully spread around. Silly.",
      "",
      "You can’t say fairer than a lovely slice of Sunday lunchtime-ish Rome derby action to set you up for the big afternoon of Barclays to follow. Especially with both teams smarting ahead of this one after disappointing defeats last time out against Sassuolo and Torino.",
      "In a just and right world it would be on Channel 4, of course, rather than so-called ‘DAZN’, but one can’t have everything.",
      "",
      "Having pretty adroitly in the end avoided Champions League humiliation at the hands of Brann, Elisabeth Terland’s hat-trick helping them overcome a 1-0 first-leg deficit with a bit to spare, attention turns back to the WSL for United and the visit of Arsenal.",
      "It’s a battle between two of the four teams still boasting 100 per cent records after two games of the new season, and one that might give us a few clues about which if either of these teams might have the best chance of ending Chelsea’s seemingly unstoppable reign of terror.",
      "Manchester United need to look at and learn from Arsenal under Mikel Arteta because nothing will change until and unless the culture is fixed properly.",

      "Legendary former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has revealed he had “never heard of” Senne Lammens prior to the Red Devils being linked with him, and has told the club who they should’ve signed instead.",
      "United were told throughout the summer that their goalkeepers were not up to scratch. For a man who reached a Champions League final with Inter Milan, it was hard to tell Andre Onana had been close to that level.",
      "As such, in the final days of the summer, he was replaced by Lammens and loaned out to Trabzonspor.",
      "Pior to Lammens’ signing, though, there were links with Emiliano Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma. The former has won the World Cup and the latter the Champions League.",
      "Schmeichel feels those are the ilk of players United should have signed, instead of 23-year-old Lammens, from Royal Antwerp.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance,” he said.",
      "“With Martinez, everything was lined up and that felt like really good news, because he’s exactly the kind of goalkeeper Manchester United should have.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up.",
      "“I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.”",
      "Lammens has a fantastic save percentage, but has never played in a top-five league, has featured in the Champions League just once, and is yet to make his national team debut for Belgium.",
      "He is still yet to play for United despite being in place for their last Premier League game – the 3-0 loss to Manchester City.",
      "Indeed, Altay Bayindir was preferred between the sticks, despite rumours he could have been allowed to leave in the summer, and the goalkeeper having made mistakes during his time in the United net.",
      "When Lammens does get his first crack is unclear, as most would have expected he’d have been in immediately after his signing.",
      "In any case, Schmeichel was disappointed that he was the man signed, not a better option, and having one of the best players ever in your position, at the club you now play for, already on your back, is not a good start.",
      "Peter Schmeichel has questioned Manchester United letting a pair of stars leave the club, and he “hopes” one of them scores “25 goals” to show them what they’re missing.",
      "The brother of new Man Utd signing Senne Lammens attempted to stop him from joining the Red Devils but the Premier League club “gave him the best feeling”.",
      "Manchester United lost their third game of the season on Sunday as rivals Manchester City beat them 3-0 in a comprehensive performance.",
      "Man Utd legend Peter Schmeichel reckons the Red Devils could have saved £73m by keeping Rasmus Hojlund and not signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Wayne Rooney hit out at one Manchester United “panic buy” after Ruben Amorim’s side suffered a one-sided 3-0 loss against Manchester City.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40m move to Chelsea after being told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Asked if the transfer could backfire on Man Utd, Amorim said: \"I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight on the Premier League card, predicting more misery for West Ham and Graham Potter.",
      "David Moyes is one of the best pound-for-pound managers in English football. Of that there is no doubt.",
      "But his away record against the big boys - notably Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City - it's dreadful. And this weekend, that's the big red elephant in the room for Everton. Since taking the West Ham job, Moyes has managed a team 19 times away at those three big clubs and has been beaten 18 times.",
      "There's lots of talk about renewed hope, a more attack-minded game plan and potentially a charge towards the European places, but it's really difficult to see how Moyes' approach at Anfield is going to lead to any points being banked.",
      "Everton will give it their all on derby day, of course, and will be tough to break down, but Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals at 11/8 with Sky Bet is a fantastic price to attack.",
      "Thomas Frank has worked wonders at Spurs in a remarkably short time, tightening up what was once a leaky defence into a disciplined, well-organised unit. They have transformed from conceding goals regularly to frustrating even the most deadly attackers. Erling Haaland has scored once in eight of his last nine starts - the anomaly was Spurs.",
      "Just one goal conceded from four games with three clean sheets is an impressive return.",
      "Their defensive shape is sharper and the backline communicates with newfound cohesion with a focus on defending central areas of their box so astutely - a similar trait to the defensive unit Frank had at Brentford.",
      "This improvement in the Spurs process means Brighton, known for attacking flair and chance creation, but a historical underperformance in front of goal, will struggle to break down Frank's resilient Spurs side. Expect a cagey, tactical battle where chances are hard to come by. The under 2.5 goals line at 6/5 with Sky Bet makes plenty of appeal.",
      "The abrupt managerial change at Nottingham Forest remains a difficult scenario to assess with serious questions about stability and style of play, and with Ange Postecoglou still settling in, Forest's performance levels and results could dip.",
      "The players need time to adapt to new tactics and expectations, and that uncertainty is never a good look in the Premier League's unforgiving environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Burnley showed just how difficult it is to break them down in their recent defeat to Liverpool, where for 93 minutes they delivered a masterclass in defensive resilience. Scott Parker's side remain rock-solid, disciplined and incredibly tough to beat based on the early signs.",
      "Backing a tight game with under 2.5 goals looks a smart move here at 4/5 with Sky Bet with no surprises from this end if Burnley were to nick it.",
      "Graham Potter arrived at West Ham bringing fresh ideas and a calm, measured approach. But that calmness has started to look more like cold silence and in a place like West Ham, that just doesn't cut it.",
      "This is a fanbase that are full of passion for their club, one that want a manager who can not only deliver results but also spark something special and embody the club. They want real connection. That's where Potter's lack of charisma is really hurting him.",
      "A manager like David Moyes before him had that grit, the personality and an emotional spark that could rally the team and fans alike when it mattered. Moyes was great in these pressurised home matches where his job was reportedly on the line. He won every time.",
      "I'm not sure Potter's quiet and measured style is going to help matters here for a team that are on their worst-ever home winless run at the London Stadium.",
      "Things could get ugly, so backing Crystal Palace with a -1 handicap at 7/2 with Sky Bet looks the way in.",
      "Anton Stach might be a player we're talking about more in the next few months - he has quietly but effectively stamped his mark on Leeds since arriving, bringing energy, intelligent positioning and a calming presence in midfield.",
      "His box-to-box runs and eye for a key pass have steadily increased Leeds' creativity and control, even if the goals haven't quite come yet. Stach is the only Premier League player to reach double figures for shots (10) and chances created (10) this season.",
      "It's only a matter of time before Stach notches a goal or an assist - the signs are there.",
      "Against Wolves, who've shown more defensive lapses this season than in the early stages of Vitor Pereira's tenure, Leeds will be pushing hard, and Stach looks perfectly placed to capitalise on any opportunities. He is 11/4 with Sky to score or assist. It's a price that's going to land soon.",
      "For all their obvious struggles, Manchester United's attack have been creating chances this season. Just one goal scored from open play to a backdrop of 5.01 worth of expected goals is a significant underperformance and suggests big moments are being created, just not taken.",
      "As is the case in football, those metrics usually correct themselves over a bigger sample size, therefore investing in United to start getting on a goal-train could be a profitable and wise move.",
      "My eyes are drawn to Bryan Mbeumo to score at 5/2 with Sky Bet here. He's getting into the right areas and has hit the target six times from his 18 shots this season, scoring against Burnley. A big moment looks around the corner for a player who - for a change - seems to be thriving in the environment at Old Trafford.",
      "Away wins are on the rise in the Premier League - and it's shaking up the traditional 'home advantage' narrative we've all been used to for years and one that is still factored - perhaps too heavily - into the way markets are priced up.",
      "Managers are more willing to take the game to their opponents and possess much more data insight from analysts into the weaknesses of opponents.",
      "Gone are the days when away teams would just hunker down and hope for a draw - games are there to be won now.",
      "Last season, the away-win strike-rate rose to 35 per cent from 380 fixtures. That figure 15 years ago in the Premier League was just 24 per cent. And Brentford look a big price for the away win at 11/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Fulham have won only four of their last 14 Premier League games at Craven Cottage and were very lacklustre and fortunate to win 1-0 over Leeds in their last outing. There might be a bit of staleness creeping in under Marco Silva that hasn't been factored into their win probabilities yet.",
      "Andoni Iraola is creating a strong body of work when it comes to facing Eddie Howe.",
      "When these two meet, Iraola's tactical set-up tends to frustrate Newcastle's game which is centred on physicality. Iraola's teams are brilliant at shutting down space, disrupting patterns of play and hitting on the counter with sharp, clinical transitions.",
      "It's that balance of defensive rigidity and quickfire attacking that has consistently caught Howe's sides off guard. In four meetings, Iraola is unbeaten against Howe, winning twice, and the underlying data paints a very clear picture of how Bournemouth have dominated the Toon.",
      "In those four matches, Iraola's team have averaged an expected goals per 90 of 2.4 - a huge figure. The home win is likely to be very popular at 13/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The Aston Villa downward trajectory wasn't something I saw coming.",
      "And while they remain in this malaise it's hard to trust them to win football matches when priced up as the favourites at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The glaring issue is their lack of cutting edge in the final third. Chance creation? It's been painfully limited.",
      "Failing to score in four matches can happen in a low scoring sport like football but the underlying numbers are extremely worrying. To put up a 0.77 expected goals tally per 90 from a relatively soft set of fixtures is a horrendous return - only Wolves have posted a lower figure.",
      "To carry this goal drought weight with you to a place like the Stadium of Light, where the home crowd is a 12th man and the team is expertly drilled, doesn't inspire much confidence that this is where things will spark for Villa.",
      "The home side on the draw no bet at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks the way to play.",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes vs Erling Haaland is always a riveting and blockbuster sideshow when these two rivals meet.",
      "There's animosity and with it comes excellent betting angles surrounding Haaland's foul output. In eight meetings where he's come up against Gabriel, the bulldozing City forward has made 16 fouls, so working to a two-per-game average.",
      "That is a spike on his usual foul data and something which is not factored into the way Haaland's foul probabilities are priced up by the traders.",
      "That's an edge right there in our favour.",
      "To keep up this average of two fouls per game, Haaland is available at a whopping 11/4 with Sky Bet, implying a probability of just 26 per cent. I'd have the chances closer to 50 per cent in this type of fiery fixture where Arsenal should edge it.",

      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited the training ground to meet with Ruben Amorim this week following their poor start to the season; Amorim: \"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win\"",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 14:16, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has played down the significance of a meeting with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe at the club's training ground this week, insisting their talks were \"normal\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe's visit.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",
      "\"I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.",
      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",
      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",

      "Between the Lines returns with an in-depth look at Ruben Amorim's system and the reasons why Man Utd are struggling to make it work; Sunday's 3-0 loss to Man City leaves them with a worse record than any ever-present Premier League side since last year",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 10:30, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

      "Man Utd accounts for 2024/25 show record revenues of £666.5m; total operating expenses down 4.5 per cent, and employee expenses by 14.1 per cent, or £51.5m; more than 250 staff members made redundant in first round of cuts; net losses of £33m down from £113m in 2024",
      "Wednesday 17 September 2025 23:10, UK",
      "Manchester United shares dropped sharply despite achieving record revenues for 2024/25 of £666.5m - after the club still made an overall loss of £33m.",
      "The club's annual accounts showed that they earned greater revenue than ever before despite not having Champions League football last season, in which they finished 15th in the Premier League - their lowest top-flight finish in 51 years.",
      "Manchester United shares dropped by eight per cent in trading in response on the New York Stock Exchange, but rebounded to finish 6.28 per cent down at $15.38 (£11.29).",
      "United still saw revenue marginally increase by 0.7 per cent to £666.5m, with the accounts for the year ending June 30, 2025 showing their operating loss fell from £69.3m to £18.4m compared to the previous 12 months.",
      "United bosses have hailed their five-year shirt sponsorship with Snapdragon as the most valuable of its kind in world sport, and that played a significant role in boosting revenues with four years remaining on that deal.",
      "United posted record commercial revenues of £333.3m while achieving record matchday revenues of £160.3m.",
      "Overall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw a raft of cost-cutting measures.",
      "The accounts show total operating expenses were £733.6m, a decrease of £34.9m, or 4.5 per cent, and employee expenses by 14.1 per cent, or £51.5m, to £313.2m.",
      "This was achieved by several high-earning players, who were not part of the first-team plans, going out on loan or being sold, and wider club restructuring. More than 250 members of staff at Old Trafford were made redundant in the first round of cuts.",
      "The club said they spent £36.6m in terms of exceptional items, which included pay-offs to employees as part of their \"transformation plan\" along with former boss Erik ten Hag and his staff.",
      "The results released on Wednesday showed broadcasting revenue for the 12 months ending June 30, 2025 decreased by £48.9m to £172.9m after the men's team played in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.",
      "More cost-cutting and difficult decisions are expected as INEOS completes its restructuring of the football club.",
      "Ratcliffe warned United would have gone \"bust at Christmas\" if they had not taken \"really tough decisions\" - something chief executive Omar Berrada believes will help moving forwards.",
      "\"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas,\" he said.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term.",
      "\"Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "\"To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United.",
      "\"Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners.",
      "\"As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"",
      "United are expecting the next financial year to bring in revenue of £640m to £660m despite being without European football for the first time since 2014/15.",
      "\"The Manchester United bosses will be pleased with these figures, which they will feel show real progress towards cutting costs and growing revenues. But theirs is a long-term plan to rejuvenate and regenerate the club, and while record revenues show that the club still has a huge commercial pull as one of the biggest in world football, fans shouldn't think that will mean bumper spending in the January window, or next summer.",
      "\"Deloitte said in January that United was the fourth biggest club in the world, only behind Real Madrid, Manchester City and PSG in terms of revenue. These latest figures will show that they have maintained that strong position, despite their worst performance on the pitch since 1974, when the club was relegated. A lack of Champions League football and a 15th-placed finish in the league cost them tens of millions of pounds.",
      "\"But the chief executive's statement has made the strategy clear: make United more and more commercially successful, and in future, there will be more and more funds to invest in the football squad, which they hope and believe will then lead to better results on the pitch, and a return to the days when they won trophies.",
      "\"We should not forget the underlying financial problems that United have, however, been brought about by the Glazer family takeover in the early 2000s.",
      "\"That 'leveraged buy-out' effectively lumped £790m of debt onto the club, which the Glazers used to buy a controlling stake at Old Trafford.",
      "\"These latest figures show that debt has reduced somewhat (by around £39m to £471.9m), but that reduction is because of a change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, rather than any of the debt being specifically paid off.",
      "\"In addition, the \"revolving credit facility\" that the club has (in effect, like a personal credit card) now has £165.1m of additional debt on it - up from £35.6m last year.",
      "\"While the record revenues and reduced losses are no doubt a sign that United are making impressive commercial strides off the pitch, the Glazer debt and the continued under-performance of the team on the pitch are two nagging negatives.\"",
