      "Thomas Frank made it clear he wanted Bryan Mbeumo to stay at Brentford \"forever\" before the end of last season, with the forward now being chased by Manchester United and the Dane's new club Tottenham.",
      "Mbeumo is one of the most sought-after Premier League players in this summer transfer window after an excellent season at Brentford saw him score 20 goals in the top flight while also registering seven assists.",
      "It was by far his best season since arriving at the club in 2019 after taking his total goal tally to 70 in 242 appearances. Now he is being tipped for a move to a big club and Manchester United have already had a bid of around £60million rejected by Brentford.",
      "But with his former boss Frank joining Tottenham, the north London side have now entered the race and Mbeumo is said to be \"intrigued\" over a move to Spurs - who have launched a bid of around £70m.",
      "Frank spoke about Mbeumo's future last month and while he admitted Brentford were a \"selling club\", he stressed he wanted to keep his star man - though that view is likely to have changed now he's linked up with Spurs.",
      "\"I've said many times: we are a selling club. But at the same time, we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world that aren't selling clubs.",
      "\"So, of course, if the right price - and that's going to be expensive - is coming, then I'm sure the club will be open for it. But I'm very happy he's here, and I'm convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.\"",
      "Mbeumo is still leaning towards Manchester United, but Spurs have received \"encouragement\" that the player could be interested now that Frank has become their new manager.",
      "There is a feeling that Mbeumo has \"earned the chance\" to join a bigger side this summer - so long as a club meets their valuation of £70m for a player who was only outscored by Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland last season.",
      "United are expected to go back in with another bid for Mbeumo, while Spurs are reportedly weighing up interest in Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo - who is also a target for the Red Devils.",

      "Manchester United will welcome Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon at the start of July after previously landing his signature in a £7million deal. The new arrival has drawn comparisons to Wayne Rooney given his impact at such a young age.",
      "The Red Devils have gone after some household names this summer but it is the lesser known individual who has been tipped to have a major impact. United paid an initial £3.3m but allowed the teenager to remain at Cerro Porteno.",
      "Playing in the Paraguayan top flight meant he was able to land regular minutes and he will hope to feature in Ruben Amorim's plans, but will have to usurp several household names in the pecking order if he wants to be considered first choice.",
      "Paraguayan football expert Ralph Hannah, co-host of the podcast Guaraní Vision, told the MEN that Leon reminds him of a teenage Rooney, who would go on to become the club's all-time leading scorer.",
      "He said: \"So far he has always played in a back four as an attacking left back, but his athleticism would suggest he would have the legs for wing back. His U17s coach Badayco Maciel told me he could play left wing. The main question marks will be tactically if he could adapt quick enough.",
      "\"For United fans his shaved head and hunched shoulders that make his seem much older than he is and are reminiscent of a teenage Rooney.\"",
      "United have previously benefitted from going after teenage talent, only to see them blossom. Alejandro Garnacho arrived from Atletico Madrid for an initial £150,000 in 2020 and has since become a first-team member and would command a hefty fee if he were to leave, which remains a possibility this summer.",
      "Amorim has wasted no time in bolstering his ranks this summer. Matheus Cunha has signed from Wolves for just over £60m, owing to a release clause in his contract. More firepower is a priority with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Bryan Mbeumo being linked.",
      "United missed out on the signing of Liam Delap, who opted to join Chelsea rather than heading to Manchester. The club's dire season though emphasised the need for improvement in a majority of areas as Amorim sets about his recruitment.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has REJECTED a move to Manchester United, reports in Portugal have claimed. The Swedish striker had been linked with a switch to Old Trafford to reunite him with former Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "But as per Record, Gyokeres has turned down the chance to become a Red Devil, with his agents informing United chiefs. Arsenal now appear to be in the lead for his services as they too pursue his signature.",
      "Gyokeres' decision comes after the striker broke his silence on the ongoing saga when it comes to his future. It was previously reported that Sporting had turned down a £55m bid for his signature from Arsenal.",
      "That apparently triggered anger from the former Coventry man, who was seemingly led to believe his current employers would allow him to leave for a modest fee only to up their demands.",
      "And that led Gyokeres to threaten strike action to force through a move away. Taking to Instagram, Gyokeres wrote: He said: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sporting Lisbon president Frederico Varandas also offered his take on the striker's future and claimed that the club would not be bullied into a sale this summer. Speaking to Record, he said: \"One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "\"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season,\" Varandas added.",
      "\"During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him. When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.\"",
      "Arsenal will now continue talks with Sporting regarding a deal but if negotiations do not prove to be productive, they could ask for around £84m for Gyokeres' services. The 27-year-old still has three years left to run on his deal with the Portuguese giants.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes that Ruben Amorim has until Christmas to impress at Manchester United before the board assess his future. The Portuguese tactician has struggled since arriving at Old Trafford in November in the wake of Erik ten Hag's dismissal, failing to mould his inherited squad to suit his patented style of play.",
      "As a result, the Red Devils finished 15th and failed to achieve any domestic or European silverware. Despite it coming as United's lowest-ever finish in the Premier League, it appears as though the board are willing to back the 40-year-old this summer and see how he performs with a full transfer window and pre-season to make adjustments.",
      "\"He's had one player, [Patrick] Dorgu, that he's been able to recruit. So, it looks like [Matheus] Cunha’s come, and I think there's hopefully going to be one or two more in this window.",
      "\"Then you can start judging him a little bit more. I don't think in his wildest dreams he thought he'd have finished 15th. None of us fans would have thought that either.",
      "\"So, that's been a huge disappointment in that sense. But I don't think you can fully judge everything he's done yet when he hasn't had a chance to bring in players. We're judging him based on someone else's players. And I think, yeah, get to Christmas and let's see how we're looking.\"",
      "After Ten Hag spent big on the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro over the summer, Amorim had little room to work with in January. As a result United brought in just two players in the form of Dorgu from Lecce for £25.1million and Ayden Heaven from Arsenal in a deal reported to be worth a little more than £1m.",
      "However, the Red Devils have hit the ground running in the early summer transfer window, signing Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5m deal as they look to bolster their strike force. They have also been linked with Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Bryan Mbeumo, although it is thought that the latter may follow Thomas Frank to Tottenham after his own departure from Brentford.",
      "Numerous names have tried to replicate the glory days of Sir Alex Ferguson at United since his retirement in 2013, including David Moyes, Louis Van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, only to come up short. And Ferdinand also noted that there could be numerous reasons as to why the club hasn't won a Premier League title in over a decade.",
      "He explained: \"If I had the answer to that question, I'd be at Man Utd now sorting things out. But I don't think it's ever one reason. I don't think when you have failures in anything, in any walk of life, it's down to one single thing.",
      "\"I think there's a number of different things that you could point to for the demise of Manchester United and sustained lack of success. I think one of them being the recruitment will be high on the list of most people, saying that the recruitment's been wrong.",
      "\"For whatever reason, for various different reasons, identifying the wrong players technically, tactically, physically, mentally at times, that's been an issue. Were the managers right for the club at the respective times that they came? Maybe not, some of them.",
      "\"And I think the actual infrastructure of the football club behind the scenes has been probably something that you looked at and gone, actually, that could have been better. And there was a big change.",
      "\"Not many clubs lose their manager, the most successful manager they've ever had, and the CEO in the same window. But Man Utd had done that, and they had two people that were pivotal to the success. One was a lot more public and was understood to be the driver of the whole machine, which he was to a certain point.",
      "\"But every great manager, every great individual, there's always a sidekick somewhere, and David Gill was that for Sir Alex Ferguson. So, to lose two of them when United did was definitely a hammer blow, but never recovered since.\"",
      "It comes as Ferdinand launched his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, in a bid to connect teenagers with their parents in making choices and planning their futures. On the campaign, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has forged a career as a successful businessman after hanging up his boots at Old Trafford. Neville, 50, dramatically called time on his football career in February 2011, walking away in the middle of the 2010-11 campaign.",
      "He left the sport after clinching two Champions League titles, eight Premier Leagues, four FA Cups and three League Cups. Now, he's set to return to the Old Trafford pitch for Soccer Aid this Sunday.",
      "His business acumen has proven as sharp as his defending, as evidenced by his colossal net worth. Finance Monthly estimates Neville's net worth to be between £70-£100million, despite a significant financial setback reported in 2022.",
      "Financial records for 'Hotel Football', which is located opposite Old Trafford and co-owned by Neville along with Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, revealed losses of £3.2m over 2020 and 2021. The company also received a loan of £10.2m from parent company 'Orchid Leisure' during that period.",
      "In October 2024, City AM reported the hotel lost £630,158 in 2022 and £601,030 in 2023. However, there were signs of recovery as the hotel's turnover increased from £6.4m to £7.8m during that time. Despite its losses, it still carries a valuation of around £20-£30m, according to FM.",
      "In addition to Hotel Football, he also owns the Stock Exchange Hotel in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester. This was entirely hired out by Madonna in 2023 when she performed in the city. Despite experiencing losses over the years, FM estimates its value at around £15-£20m.",
      "The former England star might not be pleased with the losses, but his extensive business empire provides ample cushioning. Companies House records show that Neville's hotel business has approximately £20m in assets. His property development company is also believed to hold assets worth £10.5m.",
      "When all of his other businesses are taken into account, it's reported that he has combined assets of £40m. Among these is his production company Buzz 16, which produces sports content including 'The Overlap' on YouTube, home to his popular podcast 'Stick to Football'.",
      "Like many investors, Neville has also ventured into the real estate industry as another income source. He owns a luxury home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, which has undergone significant renovations since he purchased it in the early 2000s.",
      "The venture includes a nine-floor office, a rooftop restaurant and two food and drink outlets on the ground floor. A towering 41-storey building will also be part of the project, housing a 162-bed five-star hotel, 75,000 square feet of office space and 217 apartments.",
      "Neville is also one of the owners of League Two side Salford City. The club recently announced a new ownership group, led by Neville, David Beckham, US businessman Declan Kelly and Lord Mervyn Davies.",
      "He first bought the club in 2014 alongside Class of 92 team-mates Phil Neville, Giggs, Scholes and Butt, who held a combined 50% of the club, while Singaporean businessman Peter Lim held the rest. However, the new takeover means Lim and his ex-United colleagues are no longer shareholders. The latter quartet will reportedly maintain some roles they had at the club, going into the new era.",

      "Beckham would make his United debut in September 1992, before signing his first professional contract on January 23 1993. He would win six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, two Charity Shields, the Intercontinental Cup and the Champions League during his time at the club, a part of the club's historic Treble winners in 1999.",
      "A United statement on social media said simply: \"Sir David Beckham. Massive congratulations from everyone at United on this special achievement Becks - you truly deserve this.\"",
      "Beckham himself labelled it a \"truly humbling honour\".",
      "In a statement, Beckham said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour. To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true.",

      "He spent four years with the Spanish giants - forcing United to sell him to the Bernabeu despite the club trying to sort a deal with the Madrid club's bitter rivals Barcelona - before joining LA Galaxy in MLS. He would spend spells with AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, before becoming co-owner of Inter Miami in MLS, a remarkable business move during his time in MLS allowing him to become co-owner in 2020 at a cut price rate.",

      "David Beckham declared himself \"immensely proud\" after being bestowed with a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours. Beckham, who turned 50 last month, has been given the honour for his services to sport and charity.",
      "The former England captain, who won 115 caps for the Three Lions, with 59 of those as captain and Manchester United icon has become one of the most recognisable faces on the planet, known as well in Los Angeles as he is in Auckland and pretty much everywhere in between.",
      "Speaking about his knighthood, Beckham said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour.

      "It has been a rollercoaster ride for Beckham, who used to earn £10 a shift collecting glasses at Walthamstow dog track before heading to United's academy as part of the fabled 'Class of 92', where, after making his Premier League debut in 1994, he truly announced himself as a star on the opening day of the 1996-97 season, with a memorable goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.",
      "The red card at France '98 and the subsequent fallout has never been forgotten - least of all by himself. In a Netflix documentary series, released during October 2023, Beckham revealed he still cannot forgive himself for the abuse his family suffered amid the fallout, which include a pub hanging up an effigy of Beckham, and the hostility he faced at grounds around the country the following season. He admitted it left him a \"mess\".",
      "And yet, he not only went on to be an integral part of United's Treble success in 1999 - winning six Premier League titles and two FA Cups too during his time at Old Trafford - he became England captain just two years after his dismissal in Saint-Etienne, became a one-man wrecking crew to drag the national side kicking and screaming to the 2002 World Cup with a virtuoso display and 93rd minute equaliser against Greece - and there, in Japan and South Korea, completed his redemption story with the winner against Argentina during the group stage.",
      "At the height of his footballing fame, fronting global brands and married to a pop star, he became a Galactico in 2003, joining Real Madrid in a £25million move after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and refusing to join Barcelona, having made almost 400 appearances for United and scoring 85 goals.",
      "Beckham would go on to win La Liga before he departed for LA Galaxy in 2007 and collected the MLS Cup twice, spending two loan stints at AC Milan along the way. In January 2013, Beckham returned to Europe with Paris Saint Germain, later announcing his decision to retire when he signed off with a Ligue 1 winners’ medal.",
      "During his time in the States he had already been thinking about life after football, a remarkable business move during his time in MLS allowing him to become co-owner of Inter Miami in 2020 at a cut price rate, while a multi-million-pound lifetime deal with Adidas, signed in 2003, had long since secured his financial future away from the game.",
      "Beckham, who was made an OBE for services to football in 2003, has long been involved with children’s charity UNICEF, and is a co-owner of film production company Studio 99.",
      "In 2024 he was appointed Ambassador for The King’s Foundation which works globally to create sustainable communities through placemaking projects and also transform lives through practical education programmes.",
      "Certainly, there has been no shortage of controversy, whether during his footballing career or after. But now, the man known in some quarters as 'Becks', and infamously also as 'Golden Balls', becomes Sir David.",

      "The situation surrounding Viktor Gyokeres is really starting to spiral as he pushes to leave Sporting Lisbon. Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in all competitions for Sporting this season, but is now keen to move on and test himself in the Premier League.",
      "The Sweden international snubbed a move to Saudi Arabia and Al Hilal this week, which would’ve earned him in the region of £500k-per-week. Both Manchester United - where former mentor Ruben Amorim - and Arsenal are pursuing a new No.9 this summer, and Gyokeres is keen to join either.",
      "As he does so, the fallout in Portugal is getting increasingly bitter. It has been claimed that Gyokeres is willing to go on strike to force a move away from Sporting after suggestions they’ve been increasing their asking price in talks with potential buyers, having, it’s claimed by the Gyokeres camp, to sell him for a set fee.",
      "To that end, Gyokeres has an £85million release clause in his contract, but his representatives have claimed a deal worth a total £59m had been agreed with Sporting chiefs and that that was what they are expecting him to be sold for this summer.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas hit out in response, insisting he would not be bullied into selling his club’s prized asset: \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Gyokeres himself followed that up on social media, declaring: “There is a lot of talk at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.”",
      "Now, Gyokeres' agent, Hakan Cetinkaya, had appeared to come out - according to Swedish media - and claim that he has written proof of the £59m agreement. Except he didn’t say it. Gyokeres representative didn’t make the comment, as first reported by Record.",
      "Which leaves the whole situation just looking increasingly messy. And for the two Premier League clubs who may be interested - United are prioritising Bryan Mbeumo before moving onto a No.9 while Arsenal are understood to prefer Benjamin Sesko over Gyokeres - it's looking increasingly expensive too.",

      "A long-time Newcastle United target, the Brentford forward, fresh from a 20-goal season in the top flight, won't be heading to St James' Park. According to those close to Newcastle, it's because they baulked at the Bees' transfer demands, but more particularly the Cameroon international's salary demands. Those close to the player claim he wasn't interested in a move to the North East.",
      "Instead, the No.1 choice has been Manchester United, who have made him their top target after tying up a deal for Wolves star Matheus Cunha. Offers have been made, but United have fallen short of Brentford's demands, a first offer of £45million up front with £10m in add-ons rejected, before a second bid was also turned down.",
      "Spurs have launched a £70m bid, worth £65m plus £5m in add-ons. All told, it's £10m more than United's last offer, with more guaranteed.",
      "It's understood Mbeumo still prefers to join United. Certainly they have the edge when it comes to wages, as the salary on offer at Old Trafford is between £150,000-£175,000-a-week with bonuses taking Mbeumo’s expected package to £200,000-a-week.",
      "Spurs would have to break their strict wage structure to match that, with Mbeumo expected to earn around £130,000-£140,000-a-week. Bonuses would still see it fall short of the cash he would pick up at United.",
      "But as Spurs were making their move on Friday afternoon - and before it hit the public domain - Mbeumo himself stoked the transfer rumour flame on social media, amid suggestions he's reconsidering his options. Until then, Mbeumo hadn't reacted to Frank's departure as Brentford boss, but the 25-year-old duly used his Instagram account to do just that, sharing Brentford's post confirming Frank's exit - almost 24 hours later - captioning it with two prayer emojis.",
      "Let's just say it's open to interpretation what they meant. Thank you? Please take me with you? Ultimately the proof will be in the pudding.",
      "Intriguingly, Frank was candid about his desire to continue working with Mbeumo while still Brentford boss, comments that speak volumes about his thoughts of the player.",
      "\"I'm the head coach. I want my best players to stay forever\" he said. \"I know that Bryan is very happy being here at Brentford, he's thriving, doing well and playing fantastic. What happens in the future? I don't know.",
      "\"I've said many times, we are a selling club. But at the same time, we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world that aren't selling clubs. So, of course, if the right price - and that's going to be expensive - is coming, then I'm sure the club will be open for it.",
      "\"But I'm very happy he's here, and I'm convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.\"",
      "Now, Frank is preparing to be happy elsewhere. The question is whether Mbeumo will be happy with him."

      "“It is the most common phrase that you can say at this moment, but this is the dream come true,” he told MUTV. “Maybe outside, I think maybe my decision, they don’t understand. But when you have always dreamed to play here, it’s easier to pick this decision.",

      "\"I don't think they should be getting rid of key players like that,\" Wright-Phillips told Betway. \"Because the same thing in many ways has happened to Kobbie Mainoo without even saying anything. He's just not been playing either and he was that golden child, as well, about a year ago.",
      "\"It's either that or they're trying to raise money from players they've not had to pay for. Because some of their selling, I'm not really understanding.\"",
      "Garnacho was limited to just 20 minutes in United's Europa League final defeat by Tottenham. The 20-year-old now finds himself on the brink of an Old Trafford exit with teams such as Chelsea and Napoli linked with the Argentinian for around £50m-£60m.",
      "The young winger hit out after the humbling loss in Bilbao, branding United's season \"s**t\" and adding that he would wait to see what his future holds. Wright-Phillips believes that Amorim and United have poorly handled Garnacho's situation. \"It's a hard one because I do think he's a fantastic winger,\" Wright-Phillips added.",
      "\"I like wingers that try and take on their defenders, entertain, because that's what I based my game off –entertaining the crowd, trying to make the full-back's life hell. Garnacho does that in multiple ways.",
      "\"He was obviously hurt by the decision not to start him in the final, which, to be honest, I didn't understand either, considering he had started all the other games and played really well in most of them.\"",
      "He continued: \"But before the game, the manager's seen something tactically different – whether it worked or didn't work. When he brings him on, that's when the game changed, and it was more United than Spurs, because he was causing them all sorts of problems.",
      "\"It obviously hurt him deeply, and I think the manager should have just pulled him aside and said, 'Look, I know you were hurt, but you could have just come and said it to me, you didn't have to go public'. But he's gone public. I just think there's a better way for the manager and the club to handle it.\"",

The Red Devils are planning to strengthen across the board ahead of Ruben Amorim's first pre-season in charge of the club.",
      "United agreed a £62.5million deal to bring Cunha into the side as their first signing of the summer, while the club have announced nine players will depart. Amorim's team have already shown their ambition to reinforce their forward line after a sub-par season in front of goal but Cunha's arrival is just the start.",

      "The new Premier League season is still some way away, but clubs have been giving their fans plenty to get excited about. For some, that means new signings, but for others the 2025-26 kits are the main talking point.",
      "It has become a habit of some sides to debut new kits at the end of the previous season, while others wait longer. At the time of writing, fewer than half of the 20 teams in England's top tier have shared their new releases, but we'll be updating you throughout the summer as the newest home and away kits drop.",
      "There will often be variety in new kit releases, though this is more likely to come with the change strips than with the home efforts. Traditional colours aren't tampered with quite as regularly - though there are some exceptions.",
      "This time last year, we were starting to see the first of the 2024-25 kits. If you want to refresh your memory, you can look back at our complete ranking of the home and away shirts unveiled by the Premier League's clubs last term.",
      "Those of you who liked last season's efforts might be dreading what's to come, while if you weren't a fan of last year's you might be giving your team a shot at redemption this summer. Without further ado, here are the kits which have been released so far.",
      "Arsenal released their new home kit before the end of the 2024-25 season, allowing their players to wear it for the home Premier League closer against Newcastle. The adidas shirt is red with white shoulders and a red trim, and puts a gothic letter 'A' on the badge at the forefront in a nod to the 1990-91 title winning season.",
      "\"I love our new kit, it looks fresh - I'm excited to wear this in front of our incredible supporters,\" Arsenal and England defender Myles Lewis-Skelly said when the kit was released. \"Their energy lifts us and when we step out in the shirt, we feel it more than ever.\"",
      "Aston Villa's away shirt for the 2024-25 season was all white, but that will change for the upcoming campaign. The new dark away shirt made its first appearance on the final day, when Unai Emery's side lost at Manchester United to miss out on Champions League qualification.",
      "As the club explained, the new design also carries a nod to Villa's home city of Birmingham. \"The design on the shoulders is inspired by the Bullring, one of the iconic landmarks on the skyline of Birmingham and where the club’s new store opens today - meaning both fans and players alike will wear the fabric of our city,\" the club explained along with the release in May.",
      "Chelsea were the first Premier League club to release both their home and away shirts. Both were unveiled before the Blues' Club World Cup campaign, with that competition beginning in mid-June, with the blue home kit carrying a nod to London - and their specific part of the capital.",
      "\"The fabric of London is woven into every thread of our new kit, which is inspired by the capital’s iconic landmarks and creative culture,\" a club release read. \"Chelsea Town Hall is among the architectural landmarks subtly featured on the shirt, which was unveiled by Chelsea and Nike today.\"",
      "We've also now seen Chelsea's new away kit. Players from the men's and women's teams got involved in the launch of the white away shirt with red and green trim - a nod to a 70s design.",
      "\"There is an artistic feel to our new away kit, with the photoshoot taking place at Saatchi Gallery on the King’s Road and the colour palette inspired by a cult classic kit from days gone by,\" the club announced. \"Our manager from the early 1970s, Dave Sexton, introduced an away strip back then which was a tribute to Hungary’s famous ‘Magnificent Magyars’ team from two decades earlier and it evolved into a white shirt with a broad red and green vertical stripe.\"",
      "Manchester City have shown it is possible to keep traditional colours and still get a bit creative. Their 2025-26 home kit will predominantly be sky blue, as usual, but with a white sash.",
      "City also have a sash on their change strip for the Club World Cup, which is predominantly white, in a nod to their 2009-10 away kit. However, this will just be used for the tournament, with City confirming a new away kit will be unveiled ahead of the upcoming league season.",
      "Manchester United won't have a chance to show off their new home kit in Europe, having lost in the final of last season's Europa League. However, they've wasted little time showing off what they will wear next term.",
      "United's new shirt has adidas' famous three stripes in black on the shoulders, while there is also a graphic on the sleeves inspired by the club's Old Trafford Stadium. It's capped off by the words 'Theatre of Dreams' just below the collar on the back.",
      "\"The colour red is fundamental to the club's DNA. There have been many different expressions of it over the years and, for this season, we wanted to do something a little different, using the sleeves as a canvas,\" adidas' Jurgen Rank said. \"The abstract graphic stays true to the club's DNA while providing an innovative look and feel to an otherwise classy and classic jersey.\"",
      "It's black and white again for Newcastle - no surprises there - but with a twist. The classic stripes are blended with a shepherd's check for a slightly different take on the usual colours.",
      "Newcastle debuted the kit at the end of last season against Everton, when they qualified for the Champions League despite losing their home closer. The club has also pledged to donate £5 per shirt sold to the Newcastle United Foundation.",
      "\"It’s a way for supporters to not only wear the badge, and the beautiful new kits with pride, but to directly contribute to the life-changing work the Foundation does across the region,\" chief commercial officer Peter Silverstone said. \"Together, we’re making a difference – on and off the pitch.”",
      "Spurs didn't just appoint a new manager in the first half of June - they also unveiled their new home shirt. The Europa League winners now know what they will be wearing as they look to build under that success under new boss Thomas Frank.",
      "\"The 2025/26 Kit features a subtle tweak to the navy sleeves of last season, with a new grey and ashen slate pattern under the arm and the traditional lilywhite base forming the outer part of the sleeve,\" the club announced when unveiling the new Nike shirt. The kit release was accompanied by a video featuring club legend Ledley King.",

      "The dad of one of Wrexham's star players once landed himself in hot water with Cristiano Ronaldo after his son asked him for a favour. Mick Rathbone, father of Red Dragons midfielder Ollie Rathbone, spent eight years working as a physio at Everton between 2002 and 2010.",
      "The former Blackburn Rovers and Birmingham City defender would often bring his football-mad son to work, where Toffees favourites like Wayne Rooney and Duncan Ferguson kindly took him under their wing. However, it was one of their opponents who Ollie was most starstruck by as a youngster - Manchester United legend Ronaldo.",
      "Mick revealed how it led to a very awkward encounter with the Portuguese forward in a corridor after a match between Everton and United. The incident, which left Ronaldo distinctly unimpressed, occurred after Ollie tasked his dad with getting his shirt signed by his idol.",
      "Recounting the episode in his book, The Smell of Football, Mick said: \"Sometimes, I must admit, when surrounded by these superstars, I just wanted to grab a pen and piece of paper and get their autographs, but this was frowned upon as being totally uncool.",
      "\"A few years ago, however, when we played United, Ollie begged me to get Cristiano Ronaldo's autograph on his brand new Portugal shirt that he had just received for his birthday. I really didn’t like to ask and did feel a bit of an anorak, but you know what it's like - you will do anything for your kids, won't you?",
      "\"I kept my eyes open after the game to try and catch sight of Ronaldo passing the medical room. Eventually, I saw him and stepped into the busy passageway, clutching the shirt. I was in my full Everton regalia, so I didn't feel too much of an intruder.",
      "\"'Excuse me, Cristiano, could you please sign this for my son?' He didn't look too pleased, but grabbed the shirt and the pen without looking up or acknowledging my existence, and started scribbling. 'Can you write, 'To Oliver, happy birthday' on it please Cristiano?' He still didn't look up but just kept scribbling.",
      "\"'It’s O-L-I-V…' I didn't get any further. He just threw the shirt back in my face where, due to the phenomenon that is static electricity, it stuck. He then walked away, leaving me with the shirt on my head.\"",
      "Mick added: \"There were a couple of the Everton press guys in the corridor that day who saw it all, and we absolutely p***ed ourselves laughing for the next 10 minutes. Never again.\"",
      "Ollie got a taste of life at United for himself as a youngster after coming up through the club's academy at the same time as the likes of Marcus Rashford. The 28-year-old spent eight years with the Red Devils before joining Rochdale in 2016 due to a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "He later signed for Rotherham, where he enjoyed a three-year stint, until moving to Wrexham for £500,000 last summer. Ollie impressed in his first campaign with the club owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, helping Phil Parkinson's side to achieve promotion from League One.",
      "He was also named as the club's player of the season after scoring eight goals in 41 league games. Mick has expressed his delight at Ollie's achievements at Wrexham after aiding them in reaching the Championship for the first time in 43 years.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",

      "\"He got a knock on the ankle early on in the season and had to work hard to get into the side, but once he did you knew he was going to give his all to remain there. He's consistent, got a great work-rate and he'll give you everything - and fans appreciate that.",
      "\"Supporters pay their hard-earned cash and if they see players giving it their all, they'll like you. I was a bit like that in my playing days at Blackburn as giving 100 per cent every game is the minimum requirement for a footballer, whether you're playing for Barcelona or the Dog and Duck.\"",

      "There are some ongoing changes at Manchester United that most fans won't notice.",
      "The revised transfer strategy of signing talented youngsters falls into that category. United have always signed young players to add to their academy, but the profile of targets has evolved.",
      "Sekou Kone (19) was signed from Mali, Diego Leon (18) has been scouted from Paraguay, while Enzo Kana-Biyik (18) is set to arrive on a free transfer from the renowned academy of French club Le Havre AC.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Chido Obi, James Overy, Samuel Lusale and Harley Emsden-James have also been lured to Manchester with the promise of a pathway to first-team football at Old Trafford.",
      "Heaven and Obi have already broken into the senior squad. Ruben Amorim gave opportunities to both players last season and they will be used as a shining example to future targets.",
      "United's transfer strategy has become interesting, although it could be argued they are simply catching up with the times. Premier League rivals have cast their nets around the globe to sign young players with high ceilings, some of whom will never make a first-team appearance in England.",
      "Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have been a huge factor and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea and Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "United sources would deny that young players are being signed to be 'flipped', but the reality is that not every signing will make the grade and some will be sold for profit down the line.",
      "Club sources stress that each young signing in the last 18 months has been made because they have first-team potential, however, that does not guarantee they will make a senior debut.",
      "The transfers are essentially low risk and high reward. For example, United signed Kone for around £1m for Guidars FC and the young midfielder arrived in Manchester with a huge upside.",
      "The best-case scenario is that Kone breaks into the first-team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "Similar signings were made by the previous regime, but they have increased since Ineos gained control of football operations. Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "The club's network of scouts present reports on young players and Kone was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "After following Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where he featured as one of the players of the tournament.",
      "It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",
      "Deals to sign Obi, Overy and Lusale were also arranged last summer. United became aware that Obi wanted to leave Arsenal and was about to join a European club after visiting their training ground.",
      "Nick Cox (head of the academy), Luke Fedderenko (head of academy recruitment), Stephen Ajewole (lead scout) and Sam Williams (lead scout) all played a huge role in signing Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Overy (18) attracted interest from other Premier League clubs but he signed for United, while Lusale (17) was signed from Crystal Palace, and they both went into the U18 squad.",
      "The signing of Emsden-James, 16, from Southampton this summer is similar to those deals. The centre-back will join up with the U18s in 2024/2025 and still has a long way to progress to make a first-team debut.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how United handle Kone, Leon and Kana-Biyik ahead of 2025/2026.",
      "Kone could leave on loan after being given time to find his feet in England, but Leon might be kept within the building so he can adapt to his new surroundings after leaving South America.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in early January and the defender signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year.",
      "It's understood United agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and Leon continued to play in Paraguay with a view to moving to Manchester this summer.",
      "United are expected to formally announce the arrivals of Leon and Kana-Biyik. The latter is joining from Le Havre on a free transfer and only a few regulatory steps remain for him to complete his move.",
      "The highly-regarded Kana-Biyik is a natural striker and he scored nine goals in 16 appearances for the French club's Under-19s last season, while also training with their first-team.",
      "Kana-Biyik has been linked with an immediate loan move to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport, but it's understood that no loan plan has been confirmed for the incoming French youngster.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves does exactly what his job title says on the tin and will continue to try to obtain value during negotiations this summer, wherever that may be found across the world."

      "It is more likely he will play with the under-21s to begin with but Amorim has shown he is not afraid to throw in youngsters when they are ready, handing debuts to teenagers Amass, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ayden Heaven this season.",
      "If Leon can deliver on his promise it will be the first success story of Ineos prioritising the signing of young players with high potential and low transfer fees.",
      "And that prospect should excite United fans."

      "Cunha has signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year, at Old Trafford.",
      "United will stagger the £62.5m payment to Wolves in three instalments and Cunha is the first new face through the door in the summer transfer window following an awful campaign.",

      "The 26-year-old sat down with MUTV for his first interview since signing for United and said: \"I think my decision [to join United] maybe outside, they don't understand, it was a little bit complicated.",
      "\"When you always dream to play [for United], it's easier to make this decision. But, for me, no one is like United, you know? When you have the possibility to come here... I know it was a hard season for everyone, but I think my decision shows a lot what this club is for me and what I believe it can be.",

      "The supporters of Premier League rivals suggested United would have no pull in the summer transfer window, but top players will always want to represent the biggest club in England.",
      "Cunha received interest from other Premier League sides, but the Brazilian only entertained a move to Old Trafford. It still means something to play for United, which can be forgotten particularly after a nightmare season.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has also expressed that he prefers a move to United this summer, despite interest from Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle, who are all more attractive on paper.",

However, United are still one of the biggest clubs in the world and that alone is sometimes enough to help attract top new signings."

      "Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres is a man in demand, and little wonder when you consider his goalscoring record.",
      "Since making the move to Sporting from Coventry in 2023, Gyokeres has plundered 97 goals in 102 games for the Portuguese heavyweights, including six in eight games in the 2024/25 Champions League.",
      "Gyokeres's route to the wishlist of some of Europe's top sides has been anything but conventional. Just two years ago he was plying his trade in England's second tier having failed to make a single league appearance in three years at Brighton. He was loaned out numerous times during his spell with the Seagulls, including a season in the second tier of German football and a dire stint at Swansea that saw him fail to score in 11 league outings.",
      "There's something to be admired in Gyokeres' ascent, and with so many top teams on the hunt for a new No.9 this summer it would be a shock to see him playing in the Primeira Liga next season. But Sporting certainly won't be letting him leave on the cheap.",
      "Club president Frederico Varandas addressed the speculation surrounding his star man this week, insisting he would not be allowed to leave for the €70million (£59.5m) fee that's been bandied about in recent weeks. And that could be an issue should Manchester United look to pursue Gyokeres.",
      "After years of being taken for a ride in the transfer market and paying well over the odds, United are keen to make 'the United tax' a thing of the past.",
      "Manchester City's hit rate in the market has to be admired, and so United looking to adopt their stance of rarely paying over £60m for players makes a lot of sense. It must be added that the club have already sanctioned a £62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha this summer after triggering his release clause, though the deal made a lot of sense given his Premier League record and suitability for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "If United make a move for Gyokeres this summer they're almost certainly going to break their £60m transfer rule. After finishing 15th in the Premier League with a -10 goal difference and no European football to look forward to next season, this is no normal summer and rules may need to be broken.",
      "If United can raise the necessary funds through player sales then they should be doing all they can to sign one of Europe's most in-demand strikers."

      "Should the report in Portugal be accurate, it means United are back to square one in their hunt for a new centre-forward. Gyokeres' reported rejection comes after Liam Delap decided against a move to Old Trafford to join Chelsea.",
      "Victor Osimhen and Hugo Ekitike are two players still available. Reports earlier this week claimed that United had reopened talks to land Osimhen, who recently turned down a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal."

      "Manchester United finalised their first signing of the summer on Thursday after announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "On June 1 United confirmed they had reached an agreement with their Premier League counterparts to sign the Brazilian international subject to a visa and registration.",
      "The deal has now formally gone through and Cunha has signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford. United have the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months.",
      "Cunha has become the club's first signing of the off-season after United triggered his £62.5million release clause. He was a leading target and director of football Jason Wilcox has described him \"as one of the most exciting and productive forwards in England\".",
      "Cunha will add goals and athleticism to United's attack, meaning he ticks a variety of boxes for head coach Ruben Amorim. He scored 17 goals across all competitions in 2024/25, including 15 in the Premier League.",
      "Despite strengthening their attacking pool with the addition of the former Atletico Madrid forward, United do not want their attacking additions to stop there, with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo next on their hit list.",
      "United, just over 24 hours after announcing they had reached an agreement to sign Cunha, discovered Mbeumo had chosen Old Trafford as his preferred destination this summer. United made an opening offer for the Cameroonian last week, understood to be worth £55m, but it was rejected.",
      "Nevertheless, discussions between United and the Bees have remained ongoing and the Old Trafford outfit are confident of making a breakthrough in negotiations in order to make Mbeumo their second signing of the summer. United would like to get the deal wrapped up in time for the former Troyes man to report to Carrington for pre-season training at the start of July.",
      "In addition to wanting Mbeumo, United remain hungry to sign a striker this summer. Liam Delap was United's top target to bolster their No.9 options, but they were beaten to his signature by Chelsea, meaning they are now looking elsewhere for a goal-getter.",
      "They have been linked with a collection of strikers in recent weeks, including Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli. Gyokeres is keen to leave Sporting and Napoli want to sell Osimhen.",
      "United are in desperate need of a proven goalscorer, meaning either Gyokeres or Osimhen would fit the bill. However, amid the fact they have signed Cunha for £62.5m and could end up paying around £60m for Mbeumo, outgoings will be required to fund the addition of a striker.",
      "As well as bolstering their attack, United also want to sign a midfielder. Christian Eriksen will be leaving the club when his contract expires later this month and uncertainty continues to surround the futures of both Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro.",
      "The Brazilian international is about to enter the final year of his contract and could be offloaded following United's failure to qualify for Europe next season.",
      "United also have aspirations of signing a goalkeeper amid doubts about Altay Bayindir's future at the club. Amorim wants a shot-stopper who can challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot."

      "Onana was signed by Erik ten Hag in 2023 and has endured a turbulent few years at United. His two seasons in England have been marred by errors and Ruben Amorim even took him out of the squad for the trip to Newcastle in April after two high-profile errors in the first leg of United's Europa League quarter-final tie with Lyon.",
      "Amorim wants to sign a new goalkeeper this summer to compete with Onana, though rumours suggesting he could leave the club have refused to go away.",
      "Van der Sar was asked to give his thoughts on the goalkeeper situation at Old Trafford and backed Onana to remain at United.",
      "“I’ve known him already for a long time,” he told talkSport. “He spent four or five years at Ajax. I trained with him and saw him coming.",
      "“He has great strengths. He’s athletic. He has good reaction saves. Good with his feet and everything. I’m sure he’s going to get over it.",
      "“Sometimes it’s not easy. Sometimes your performances or the pressure there is. But I’ve seen him play for Ajax, for Inter, Champions League finals. I’m sure he’s going to be fine for next season.”",
      "Even if Onana isn't sold this summer United's goalkeeping department is expected to be given a shake-up. Altay Bayindir could leave in search of more regular football, though veteran shot-stopped Tom Heaton remains in contract talks ahead of his deal expiring at the end of this month."

The payment will be split across three instalments with the Brazil international signing a five-year contract with the option of an additional year at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is expected to look to bring in at least two more players this summer and after missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Mbeumo is now the priority. The Brentford star is a wanted man after bagging 20 Premier League goals last season.",
      "It had previously been understood that Mbeumo wanted to join Cunha at Old Trafford with an agreement with Brentford the only crease to iron out. However, Thomas Frank's move to Tottenham has sparked interest from north London which could make the move more difficult.",

I know it was a hard season for everyone, but I think my decision shows a lot what this club is for me and what I believe it can be.\"",
      "The 26-year-old also hyped-up the job United boss Amorim did in prising him away from Molineux, another nod to Mbeumo on what to expect from the Portuguese.",

      "United would have banked up to £25m from Chelsea for Sancho had they not backed out of their obligation to sign him permanently. It is expected that he will be available for somewhere in the region of £20m.",

      "He \"proved his ability to succeed in the Premier League\" at Wolves, notably at Old Trafford in April. However, he is not a centre-forward, playing best as a second striker behind a focal point.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen was that for him last season, holding up play with impressive control and touch at 6ft 4in. Ekitike, in comparison, is of similar stature, at an inch shorter.",
      "The latter, however, is heralded for attacking crosses, cutting inside from the left channel and running into space behind defences akin to Alexander Isak. While there may not be as many opportunities for the latter at United as playing for Eintracht Frankfurt, the other two tendencies bode well for playing in the Premier League.",
      "Being clocked as one of the quickest players in the Bundesliga last season can only help an often slow-looking United forward line. A dozen assists across all competitions last term also hint at a developing ability to link play.",
      "That is what Cunha is due to bring, but complementing the forward like Strand Larsen would be a bonus for Ekitike, as well as being more of a threat in front of goal, scoring 22 times in his first full season for Eintracht. Cunha enjoyed the best season of his career while playing with the big Norwegian, who likewise had his second-best goalscoring campaign.",
      "Ekitike, meanwhile, combined with Omar Marmoush for the first half of last season. Nine of his assists and 14 goals came after the latter's transfer to Manchester City, showcasing an enhanced ability to provide for teammates when leading the line.",
      "Cunha and Marmoush are comparable players, with no players across Europe's top five leagues scoring more from outside the penalty area last season. Their five strikes match Bruno Fernandes, Federico Valverde, Lamine Yamal and Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The former, likely being in a more withdrawn role next season, suggests those numbers could drop. Cunha coming in ahead of the United captain suggests he can make up for any reduced productivity from range."

      "The German’s price of £116m will make him the record arrival into British football but what of the current top 10?",
      "Here’s a look at the most expensive players in Premier League history and whether they sank or swam at their new clubs.",
      "10. Josko Gvardiol – £78 million\nThe £77m paid out by Manchester City for Josko Gvardiol made him the second most expensive defender in the world but already the Croatian has gone some way to proving he was worth the money.",
      "In a season of underwhelming performances, Gvardiol was a rare bright spark and was even playing out of position at left back.",
      "He featured in all but one league game, scoring five goals in that time, and has emerged as one of the best defenders in the league.",
      "City look to be in the market for a left-back, meaning Gvardiol should be able to move into his more comfortable centre-half position next season.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "9. Harry Maguire – £80 million\nIn United’s ‘banter era’, Maguire has become the unwitting face but look beyond the memes and the defender has been a rare consistent performer at Old Trafford.",
      "Joining in 2019, he has made 247 appearances for the club and as managers have come and gone, he still remained in the side.",
      "Maguire was at his best in the tail end of United’s 2024-25 campaign and even if it ended in a Europa League final defeat and 15th-place finish, Maguire was one of the few to come away with his reputation not broken beyond repair.",
      "Was he worth the £80m United stumped up? Probably not but there are plenty of worse signings in this list.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "8. Antony – £86 million\nSpeaking of…",
      "Manchester United’s signing of Antony has turned out so poorly that almost everyone involved is trying to claim it was not their idea.",
      "After a good but not spectacular season at Ajax in 2021-22, United opted to fork out up to £86m for the Brazilian but the wheels soon began to fall off.",
      "It started promisingly with a goal against Arsenal in his debut but his scoring soon dried up. The Brazilian ended his first year with eight goals in 44 appearances.",
      "Forever remembered for a roulette spin that went nowhere, Antony scored just one league goal in his second season at Old Trafford and after making only eight appearances in the 2024-25 Premier League season, he was shipped out on loan to Real Betis.",
      "It was in Spain where Antony recovered his form, earning a nomination for La Liga Player of the Month and helping Betis reach the Conference League final as he became the latest United player to flourish away from Old Trafford.",
      "His Betis performances were a small consolation for United who may be able to claw back some of his transfer fee but regardless of where he goes, the Old Trafford side are certain for a big loss.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "",
      "7. Mykhailo Mudryk – £89 million\nIf the logic behind United’s move for Antony seems shaky, the thought process Chelsea followed to sign Mudryk now seems outright absurd.",
      "After the war in Ukraine suspended football in the region, Mudryk made played 19 times in the 2021-22 season but his performances convinced Chelsea to part with £89m to bring him to Stamford Bridge in a move that represents peak Boehly transfer strategy.",
      "Since then, Mudryk has struggled to break into the team, playing 15 league games in his first season without scoring. He did at least play 41 times in the 2023-24 campaign, ending it with just 11 goal involvements.",
      "As a result, Chelsea looked to strengthen in that position, pushing Mudryk to the bench before he was hit with a provisional suspension for failing a doping test. But even as he waits for the result of the second test, Chelsea’s view on him was made clear when they gave his number 10 shirt to Cole Palmer.",
      "The good news for Chelsea is there are only another six years on his contract to go.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "",
      "6. Paul Pogba – £89million\n#Pogback did not turn into the homecoming that either player or club was expecting.",
      "Paul Pogba’s unveiling as a United player in a video backed by Stromzy seems a fever dream now and the Frenchman became the biggest figure of frustration during the Mourinho era.",
      "Aside from pushing Graeme Souness to an early grave, Pogba’s very brief moments of brilliance only made his time at Old Trafford even more exasperating as for every game he was good in, he would spend 10 as a passenger.",
      "Eventually, United cut their losses – allowing his contract to expire and Pogba moved back to Juventus again.",
      "In February 2024, Pogab was hit with a four-year ban for doping but it was reduced on appeal. Now able to play again, the Frenchman has been unable to find a club as of yet.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "5. Romelu Lukaku – £97million\nIf the other names on this list disappointed on the pitch, at least they did not take to the media to openly criticise the club and beg for a move away.",
      "Lukaku returned to Chelsea in 2021 on the back of an incredible season with Inter but the Belgian soon found himself a square peg in a round hole given Thomas Tuchel’s system.",
      "He went nuclear in his response, taking to the media in December to criticise Tuchel before saying he wanted to return to Inter “in the near future.” He was unsurprisingly dropped from the squad as a result.",
      "Peace talks between him and the now-England manager were held, culminating in a public apology from the player but a few months later and he was sent back out on loan to Inter.",
      "The following season, he stayed in Italy this time with Roma before joining Napoli permanently in 2024.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "4. Jack Grealish – £100million\nBefore heading to the Etihad, Grealish was one of the most reactive and expressive players in the league but he would not be the first, or last, to find himself just a part of Pep Guardiola’s system.",
      "The Catalan manager tends to leave new signings to it in their early days, meaning Grealish’s numbers were quite good, but as more was asked of him, the former Villa player’s performances took a nose dive.",
      "A great season in the Treble-winning campaign was followed by a stop-start season in 2023-24 and he ended the year with just six goal involvements in 36 games.",
      "Last season he was relegated to the bench, playing just 715 minutes in the league and now looking destined for the exit door.",
      "Summing up his City career then is a difficult task as he was a big part of the Treble success but has been limited since then and you don’t pay £100m for a bit-part player.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "3. Declan Rice – £105million\nIt seems odd to call someone who cost more than £100m a bargain but Rice is looking increasingly like that.",
      "Already a talent at West Ham, Rice has improved to be one of the best midfielders in the world and when the likes of Martin Odegaard have gone missing, he has stepped up to the big occasion.",
      "A duo of stunning free-kicks saw Arsenal ease past Real Madrid in the Champions League – the highlight of their season – and you get the feeling that if the Gunners are to break their league title drought, Rice will be key to that.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "MORE ON FLORIAN WIRTZ’S MOVE TO LIVERPOOL ON F365\n👉 Liverpool: Ornstein reveals final ‘agreed fee’ for Florian Wirtz with Romano price £11m off\n👉 Ten reasons ‘magician’ Wirtz is worth £126.9m to Liverpool\n👉 Guardiola issue emerges as reason Wirtz ‘turned down’ Man City to sign for Liverpool",
      "2. Enzo Fernandez – £106.8million\nIf Rice has been money well spent, Chelsea’s version has yet to fully justify his price tag.",
      "Coming off a World Cup win, the fee Chelsea were going to have to pay Benfica was always going to be high but £106.8m looked particularly costly.",
      "He has been the scorer of some important goals and by no means is a complete flop but the Argentine needs to do more if he is going to prove value for money.",
      "Verdict: Miss (for now)",
      "1. Moises Caicedo – £115million\nAdmittedly, Caicedo’s Chelsea debut was not the best start.",
      "A cameo of 37 minutes saw him give away a last-minute penalty that coset Chelsea and had rival fans laughing but rather than shrink under the pressure, the Ecuadorian has grown into his role at the club.",
      "Even playing right-back on occasion Caicedo started every league game for the Blues last season and made himself indispensable.",
      "His price tag does still seem a little high but it gets far fewer mentions now than it did after that horror debut.",

      "Tottenham Hotspur have submitted a £70million bid to hijack Manchester United’s move for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last season – a tally bettered only by Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland – and also contributed seven assists.",
      "The Cameroonian international has just one year left on his contract, although Brentford hold the option of a further year.",

      "Tottenham’s offer is worth £65million up front, with a further £5million in add-ons – £10million more than Manchester United’s most recent bid, according to the Mirror.",
      "The report says new Spurs boss Frank is keen to bring Mbeumo to north London after working with the forward at Brentford since 2019 and that the club have ‘launched a £70m bid to hijack United’s move’.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy views Mbeumo as a statement signing for Frank’s first summer in charge following Ange Postecoglou’s departure.",

      "The Gunners have already got a deal for Real Sociedad midfielder ‘done and signed’ despite reports that Spanish giants Real Madrid could hijack the transfer.",

      "Updating everyone on Gyokeres’ situation, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said on his YouTube channel earlier this week: “Gyokeres was and remains an option for Arsenal in terms of new striker. Because at the moment my information is Arsenal are advancing on the deal for Benjamin Sesko.",

      "“At the moment Sesko remains the favourite, Viktor Gyokeres remains the other option on the table, but as it’s now two or three weeks that Arsenal are still not advancing on the Gyokeres deal, all the other clubs keep calling his agents.",
      "“That’s what happened in the last 48 hours over the weekend. From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",

      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",
      "After reports that Arsenal have made an opening bid for the Swede, Portuguese outlet Maisfutebol insist that the Gunners ‘are already preparing a second offer’.",
      "It is the Premier League club’s ‘aim is to improve the fixed value of the offer and, with that, exceed the 70 million euros in total deal (fixed value + bonuses for objectives)’.",
      "Their initial showed Arsenal ‘willing to pay a fixed amount below 60 million euros (something around 55 million euros), but which, with bonuses for objectives, could reach close to 65 million euros’.",
      "After the ‘urgent request’ by Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, it is claimed that ‘there has been growing optimism among the Swedish international’s representatives regarding a positive outcome’.",
      "While Man Utd ‘continue to say that they are ready to make an official offer of 60 million euros fixed, with another 10 million euros for objectives’.",

      "",
      "A move to a Big Six club had been long overdue for perennial overachiever Thomas Frank as he’s made pretty light work of establishing Brentford in the Premier League, with two top-half finishes and three of his four seasons in the division ending without even the slightest fear of relegation.",
      "It’s a phenomenal achievement for a club of Brentford’s size and it’s a credit to them and Frank in particular, that it would feel weird not to have them in the Premier League with their feet firmly under the top-flight table.",
      "Frank’s move to Tottenham for a supposed upward career move could raise their relegation fears, but the ever-increasing gap to the Championship should cushion their likely decline next season as Leeds United and co. face an uphill battle to buck a disheartening trend.",
      "Brentford’s situation would become more problematic if several key stars follow Frank in leaving this summer, though. With that, we have decided to prepare their supporters for this worst-case scenario (you’re welcome, by the way) by reassigning five Bees standouts to rival Premier League clubs…",

      "Bukayo Saka has emphatically left Gabriel Martinelli in the dirt, with their respective development heading in opposite directions as the stagnated Brazil international’s uninspiring form has fuelled their interest in potential upgrades, including one ‘dream target’.",
      "With a large chunk of Arsenal’s summer budget likely to be spent on a striker, they may not have the financial muscle to splash out on a direct upgrade on Martinelli and if they decide to pursue an affordable option to compete with, rather than replace, the Gunners star, Schade would not be a bad shout.",
      "The 23-year-old, valued at £25m on transfermarkt amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund, enjoyed a breakout season in 2024/25 and was a consistent provider of goal involvements, with his final total of 13 in 38 games a more-than-respectable tally.",

      "It has not helped that the squad inherited by Amorim was not suited to his 3-4-3 system, but their dire Premier League form ensured they were shot of confidence and the lack of creativity in the side was laid bare as they struggled to forge enough openings at goal.",
      "The Red Devils seemingly have two irons in the fire for a new No.9, while significantly more progress has been made in their overhaul of the No.10 department, with £65m-rated Mbeumo set to follow Matheus Cunha in joining United for four reasons.",
      "This is somewhat surprising given how shambolic United were in the 2024/25 season, but the grandeur of the club is  still enough to lure key targets to their “graveyard”. Mbeumo and Cunha are great signings on paper, but we have been here before and success at Old Trafford, even for these seemingly safe bets, is far from a guarantee.",

      "His 19-goal Premier League tally was one shy of Mbeumo’s total as Brentford had two representatives in the chasing pack of big names left behind by Mohamed Salah due to the Liverpool star’s incredible stats.",
      "In previous seasons, Wissa has mostly been used as a winger, but circumstances meant he had to operate as a No.9 in 2024/25 and he seamlessly adapted to this role and is attracting interest from elsewhere.",
      "The age factor is against the 28-year-old as clubs eye targets with a longer shelf life, but Forest plotted an ambitious move in January and their chances of landing him have increased since securing European football. It’s hard to see Chris Wood replicating his relentless scoring next season, so Wissa would be a wise addition as Nuno Espirito Santo’s side prepares to juggle competing in four competitions.",

      "The caveat of Tottenham’s injury crisis is not enough to justify their shambolic Premier League displays this season, with 22 losses in 38 games resulting in an embarrassing 17th-place finish.",
      "Their much-needed Europa League triumph was not enough to save Ange Postecoglou, but it provides Frank and their recruitment team with a strong platform to build with Champions League football delivering a huge injection of funds.",
      "You have to fancy Frank to steady the ship at Spurs with a more flexible approach than Postecoglou, while his philosophy is front-foot enough to align with the Spurs way.",
      "As Spurs showed in the Europa League final, they can be strong defensively when tasked to do a job on an opposing team and Collins would provide strong competition to their current crop, and this transfer would be needed more if Cristian Romero is shown the door with a move to Liverpool mooted.",
      "",
      "Mikkel Damsgaard to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs only remained afloat amid their wide-ranging injury crisis due to the bottom three being quite so poor, so they need to build a well-equipped squad with quality cover in all positions if they are to compete in several competitions next season.",
      "Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison are brilliant assets when fit and firing, but they have had their respective issues with injuries and a loss of form this season, so Damsgaard would at least be a suitable squad player for Spurs, especially considering his ability to operate in several roles.",
      "The 24-year-old arrived in the Premier League with plenty of promise but fell short of expectations in his first two years, though he is coming off a standout campaign as he reached double figures for assists in the Premier League and could be another regen of fellow Dane Christian Eriksen.",

      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Arsenal-bound Martin Zubimendi is the best on offer.",
      "",
      "10) Douglas Luiz (Juventus)\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder left England to ease Profit and Sustainability pressures last summer. He had been superb in 2023/24, but his debut season in Italy was anything but.",
      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from Nottingham Forest. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",
      "",
      "9) Alan Varela (Porto)\nVarela is only 23 but still uncapped for Argentina, which is mildly baffling. He’s quietly become one of the best defensive midfielders in Portugal, and we expected more concrete interest from the continent by now.",
      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked at one juncture, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract just weeks ago.",
      "That alone makes him the least likely on this list to actually move this summer.",
      "",
      "8) Thomas Partey (Arsenal)\nPotentially available on a free transfer, Partey is in talks to extend his Arsenal contract. If he does leave, he could be the bargain of the window.",
      "This was the first season since joining Arsenal that Partey has managed to stay fit throughout, which is typical in a contract year. Had his deal expired any other summer, Mikel Arteta would probably have let him walk.",
      "Not only was Partey reliable for once, he also played extremely well, and quietly became one of Arsenal’s most important players.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye Isak alternative, City to spoil Arsenal plan\n👉 Best attacking midfielders available this summer: Liverpool-bound Wirtz, Rogers, De Bruyne…\n👉 Spend now, sell later? Man Utd could be stuck with bloated bomb squad",
      "",
      "7) Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich)\nOne of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League during his Fulham days, it just hasn’t happened for Palhinha at Bayern. He earned a deserved move last summer, but could be out the door again after just one season.",
      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign. At 29, he might prefer to stick around at a club like Bayern, where he’s only an injury or two away from regular minutes under Vincent Kompany.",
      "",
      "6) Morten Hjulmand (Sporting)\nViktor Gyokeres is the headline-grabber at Sporting, on and off the pitch, reportedly telling the club he won’t play for them again, but Hjulmand is catching plenty of admiring glances of his own.",
      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 25, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",
      "",
      "5) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",
      "A quiet summer, reportedly involving a bit of Italian culture, could be exactly what he needs. Clubs should be circling, because United might just let their most gifted academy graduate in decades leave for the right price.",
      "",
      "4) Carlos Baleba (Brighton)\nBrighton’s next mega-sale is likely to be Baleba, who’s quietly become one of the most complete young midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "Clubs might not think he’s worth £80million, but Brighton think he is, and they’re rarely wrong. They won’t sell for a penny less, either. They’re not quite Benfica levels of shrewd, but they’ve set the standard in England.",
      "",
      "3) Andrey Santos (Chelsea)\nExpect to see a wave of Chelsea players spending time at Strasbourg, as Todd Boehly continues to treat the French club as his own personal Vitesse.",
      "Santos was one of the most impressive midfielders in Ligue 1 this past season and is the only returning loanee Enzo Maresca has included in Chelsea’s Club World Cup squad, with Strasbourg team-mate Djordje Petrovic missing out.",
      "Despite his huge ceiling, Chelsea seem happy to sell him to fund the next phase of their transfer binge, even if his replacement is worse and has less potential. Arsenal are reportedly sniffing around and could move if Partey doesn’t extend his contract.",
      "",
      "2) Ederson (Atalanta)\nThere’s a good chance Ederson ends up in Saudi Arabia, with Club World Cup-bound Al Hilal keen to sign him from Atalanta.",
      "They won’t have him in time for the tournament and struggled to convince top targets before the first summer deadline, so he’s high on their list. The 25-year-old often emerges as a Plan B for clubs chasing midfielders; Manchester City had him on standby if Tijjani Reijnders didn’t move, while United and Liverpool have been linked over the past year.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad)\nTechnically, Zubimendi is available – and reportedly has an agreement with Arsenal.",
      "£51million would be a very solid deal. That’s half the price of Declan Rice and he’s certainly not half the player. Arteta hopes Zubimendi can become his Rodri, and we don’t see any reason why he can’t be…",

      "A rant from Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘weakened’ the negotiating position of Manchester United for one of their players, meaning his value might have dropped by £20million.",
      "United are willing to let a number of their attackers leave this summer. The likes of Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford will all be able to leave if the Red Devils can find suitors for them.",
      "For Garnacho, it seems that won’t be a problem, as Chelsea, Bayer Leverkusen, Napoli and AC Milan are among those linked with him.",
      "However, United have seemingly backed themselves into a corner. Manager Amorim reportedly tore Garnacho to pieces in front of his team-mates – after the winger had called the club’s season sh*t in an interview.",
      "He is reported to have made no illusions about the star’s future, stating: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "But according to GIVEMESPORT, that has put United in danger of having to offload Garnacho below their initial demands.",
      "It’s said the Manchester outfit could be forced to sell the winger at a discount of £20million or more, as Amorim’s decision to single Garnacho out as a player needing to head through the door has ‘weakened their negotiating position’.",
      "Indeed, admirers have given indications that they are not willing to match Garnacho’s price tag since Amorim’s angry rant.",
      "Each of the interested sides will look to secure a cut-priced deal as they seek to take advantage of the ‘strong desire’ for United to get him off the books.",
      "It’s previously been stated that the Red Devils were hopeful of making £70million from Garnacho, but the report states that there’s no indications that clubs are even willing to pay £50million.",
      "It is not clear what clubs would be willing to pay, and who will have the upper hand of the interested sides.",
      "However, United’s desire for an early solution in the Garnacho saga has also gone out the window, given clubs are seemingly ready to wait until the Red Devils make it clear they’ll accept less than they would currently.",
      "The same has already been said of Marcus Rashford, but less because of his price tag, and more than his favoured destination, Barcelona, are willing to wait until the back end of the summer to make attempts at his signing.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are involved in a ‘three-way Premier League battle’ to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho.",
      "Man Utd have to get busy with new signings but confidence in their ability to raise money through sales seems as woefully misplaced as ever.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed the precise chances that a Manchester United man joins Chelsea, as he has reiterated that the star ‘will leave’ the club.",
      "Man Utd legend Cristiano Ronaldo ‘demanded’ that Al-Nassr signed Alejandro Garnacho this summer during his contract negotiations, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are among the clubs interested in signing Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Chelsea.",

      "Three of those players were out on loan last season, and though Aston Villa have the option to make Rashford’s loan permanent for £40million, it looks increasingly likely they will swerve that chance.",

      "But if they cannot do so, Barca are prepared to play the waiting game, and there’s a chance they are the only viable location for Rashford by the time the window starts drawing to a close.",
      "That would be less than ideal for United, as it would mean they would not get a big contract off the books permanently, and they’d not receive a fee that they could put towards a replacement player.",
      "They will hope that they can raise funds elsewhere, but they are also desperately searching for a buyer for Antony, and it seems there’s a chance he once again heads out on loan, with Real Betis keen to sign him on loan with an option to buy, meaning there’s no guarantee of payment at all, and if there is, it will come in a year’s time.",
      "Why send Marcus Rashford on loan when the alternatives aren’t as good? ‘Talent alone doesn’t go to United to die, sense does.’",

      "Indeed, there is a chance that the price gets bumped up given Tottenham interest in Mbeumo. It’s believed that Brentford boss Thomas Frank has signed as Spurs boss, and after it was already suggested he wanted to take the Bees forward with him, he’s been prompted to do so.",

      "Their top scorers in the league scored eight goals apiece, and neither were strikers. The highest-scoring striker out of centre-forwards Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee was the former, who bagged four goals in 32 games – one more than the Dutchman in the same amount.",
      "There’s been heavy speculation on the future of the pair, particularly Hojlund.",
      "He has been linked with a move back to Italy – where he played with Atalanta prior to his £72million United signing – with Inter Milan, and Capello feels he’d be a good option.",

      "Bonny, at 21, is just a year younger than Hojlund, and just finished a Serie A season for Parma with six goals and four assists.",
      "Hojlund’s only season in Italy saw him back nine Serie A goals and four assists, but his last season in any football was an underwhelming one.",
      "In any case, it is believed that Inter might well make attempts to land Hojlund. It is believed that the Serie A side have tried to sign both the Dane and his United team-mate Zirkzee.",

      "A new FC Barcelona transfer target could reportedly ‘close the door’ on Marcus Rashford’s proposed move from Manchester United to the La Liga giants.",
      "Barcelona already have two of the best wingers in the world as Ballon d’Or contenders Raphinha and Lamine Yamal are coming off sensational solo seasons, but they are in the market for reinforcements in this department as they feel they need cover.",
      "Their sporting director, Deco, recently confirmed this plan in an interview, while naming Rashford and Liverpool’s Luis Diaz as targets.",
      "He said: “We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players.",
      "“When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team.”",
      "Barcelona have been heavily linked with a move for Rashford over the past six months and they were mooted as a possible destination for the England international in January.",
      "After falling out with Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim, Rashford announced his intention to leave the Red Devils in January and he eventually joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m.",
      "READ: Spend now, sell later? Man Utd could be stuck with bloated bomb squad",
      "Aston Villa decided to take a punt on Rashford after selling Jhon Duran to Al Nassr, while Barcelona were put off by the Man Utd’s forward huge salary and poor form.",
      "This risk paid off for Aston Villa as Rashford grabbed four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Aston Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the 2024/25 season and this looks set to impact their hopes of signing Rashford permanently, as he prefers a ‘dream’ move to Barcelona.",
      "However, Man Utd’s reported £40m asking price and Rashford’s asking price are still obstacles for Barcelona, who could move for a much cheaper alternative.",
      "This is according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who claim an upcoming Barcelona transfer would ‘close the door’ on Rashford’s chances of joining the La Liga giants.",
      "Former Spurs star Ivan Perisic, who grabbed 16 goals and ten assists for PSV Eindhoven in 2024/25, is ‘of particular interest’ to Barcelona and ‘one of the first possible reinforcements’ this summer ahead of his contract expiry on June 30.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Barcelona have begun to make moves in the transfer market, and according to sources close to the club, Ivan Perisic is emerging as one of the first possible reinforcements.",
      "‘The Croatian winger, whose contract with PSV is ending, is of particular interest to Hansi Flick, who previously worked with him during his time in Germany. This deal, if finalised, would have an immediate impact on the pursuit of Marcus Rashford, whose signing would lose momentum in the Camp Nou offices.’",
      "Why send Marcus Rashford on loan when the alternatives aren’t as good? ‘Talent alone doesn’t go to United to die, sense does.’",
      "Manchester United will have to wait for a European giant to spring into action in the ‘latter stages’ of the summer transfer window for a sale, so hopes of it ...",
      "Man Utd have to get busy with new signings but confidence in their ability to raise money through sales seems as woefully misplaced as ever.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has informed his agent that he doesn’t want to sign for any other club this summer apart from Barcelona.",
      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man Utd and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "Man Utd have received an offer from Inter Milan for Marcus Rashford which ‘improves’ on Barcelona’s bid for the England international, according to reports."

      "After three years in the international wilderness, Fabio Capello saw fit to reintroduce Scott Carson to the England fold in 2011. The goalkeeper’s most recent appearance for the Three Lions had come during his time at West Brom, but when he replaced Joe Hart at half-time of a 1-0 win over Sweden, he was plying his trade in Turkey with Bursaspor. Jack Rodwell and Bobby Zamora also featured in a game settled by a deflected Gareth Barry header, which feels remarkably fitting.",

      "Al-Ahli (1)",
      "We thought he might have played his last game for England when he left Brentford for Saudi Arabia, but the unavailability of Ollie Watkins, Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden meant a return to the fold/bench, where he was ‘fuming’ to be only given a few minutes at the end of a 3-1 friendly defeat to Senegal.",

      "Real Madrid (1)",
      "After seven years of dividing opinions between England fans – was he quite obviously the best right-back of his generation, an option in midfield or a defensive liability that should be shunted from the squad? – as a Liverpool player, Trent became the sixth Real Madrid player to represent England when he come off the bench in a 1-0 win over Andorra.",

He had played three times for England before moving to Spain in 1980, with his subsequent three caps all falling in that calendar year. He later moved to Sporting Gijon, Marseille, Charleroi and Rayo Vallecano (twice) before his untimely passing in 1989, but never again came onto the Three Lions radar.",

      "One year with Highley Miners Welfare, two apiece at Kidderminster Harriers and Cardiff and four years as a striker at Aston Villa persuaded the oft-ignored Gerry Hitchens to move further afield for his opportunities. And to be fair to him, more than half his caps came after he left England behind for Italy. He was actually the first player to be capped for England while playing abroad, and the first to go to a major tournament (the 1962 World Cup) while playing for a foreign team.",

This is the David Watson of relative journeymanship, who ended up at Werder Bremen in 1979 after spells with Notts County, Rotherham, Sunderland and Manchester City. His red card and subsequent eight-week ban in his second Werder game – as well as an early return to England – meant he played more often for his country (four times) than his club (twice) while in Germany.",

      "Roma (5)",
      "In that eternal race to live off a cameo minute every other game when Kane is given a rest by being substituted late on, Abraham really staked his claim in a 27-goal debut season with Roma.

After his particular brand of Fronting Up reached a crescendo at Euro 2016, Hart was bombed out of the Manchester City starting line-up by Pep Guardiola but held on to his England shirt for a while, including during that weird loan in Italy where his name was listed as ‘John’ on a team sheet that one time, despite his actual name being neither that nor Joe, but instead Charles. Fair play. No chance you get away with calling yourself ‘Hartdog’ if your name is Charles.",

      "19) Michael Owen – 11 caps (of 89)",
      "Real Madrid (11)",
      "Owen is not remembered all that fondly in Real Madrid – or any of his former clubs really – despite an impressive record of 17 goals in 26 starts. During his sole season in Spain, he retained his England place and duly netted six times in 11 matches. That included a hat-trick in a win over Colombia in May 2005 – six days after former club Liverpool had lifted the Champions League.",

      "Lazio (12)",
      "In total, 34 of Gascoigne’s 57 caps came while he was playing club football outside of England. He earned more caps in three years at Rangers (22) than in four with Tottenham (20), as well as 12 at Lazio and three with Middlesbrough. He was sadly never even called up while at Chinese second-tier side Gansu Tianma, despite boasting a record of two goals in four games.",

      "Real Madrid (13)",
      "UEFA once noted that ‘of all England’s footballing exports in the modern era, none was as successful as McManaman’. Yet even while he was scoring in Champions League finals and winning La Liga crowns, he was never truly a regular for his country.",

      "England’s 1982 World Cup squad contained three players each from Ipswich, Liverpool and Manchester United, two from Arsenal, Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and then one from Aston Villa, Brighton, Southampton and West Ham. Woodcock, then coming to the end of his first spell at FC Koln, was truly the odd one out.",
      "",
      "15) Paul Ince – 17 caps (of 53)",
      "Inter Milan (17)",
      "Ince had just barely left Serie A by the time his most memorable and blood-soaked England performance came against Italy in October 1997. But the midfielder was in the midst of his Italian job during Euro ’96, where he was supposedly the designated sixth penalty taker in that semi-final shoot-out.",
      "",
      "14) Des Walker – 17 caps (of 59)",
      "Sampdoria (17)",
      "Paul Gascoigne emerged from the 1990 World Cup as a global superstar, but he was not the only England player to impress sufficiently to earn a move to Italy. In the same summer Gazza left Tottenham for Lazio, Walker departed his Nottingham Forest home to try his luck at Sampdoria. His time in Serie A was not quite so memorable, with Sven-Goran Eriksson playing him out of position at right-back in his only year outside of England, but he did keep his international place.",

      "12) Kieran Trippier – 19 caps (of 42)",
      "Atletico Madrid (19)",
      "Two-and-a-half seasons of learning under the cojones of Simeone did absolutely nothing whatsoever to impact the England prospects of Trippier; it might even have strengthened them, considering it was somewhere around the defender’s move to Spain when Gareth Southgate decided that yeah, this man is also a left-back. It does not feel like a coincidence that he retired from international football straight after the manager resigned.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – 22 caps (of 23)",
      "Borussia Dortmund (22)",
      "That says plenty about his brilliance in Germany. It also says absolutely loads about how things have gone in England.",
      "",
      "10) Trevor Francis – 22 caps (of 52)",
      "Detroit Express (2), Sampdoria (20)",
      "Most will know that many of Francis’ England caps came during his spell in Sampdoria, but he also earned a couple of call-ups while on a weird kind of loan with NASL side Detroit Express. He headed to America at the end of the 1977/78 season with Birmingham, returned to become the first £1m footballer with Nottingham Forest in February 1979, then went back to Detroit that summer, never fully losing his grip on an England place.",
      "",
      "9) Ray Wilkins – 22 caps (of 84)",
      "AC Milan (22)",
      "Far from damaging his England prospects, Wilkins found that his candle shone brighter away from the spotlight. He made nine and ten international appearances in 1985 and 1986 respectively – his two full calendar years in Italy. Only in 1982 (12) did he play more often for his country.",
      "",
      "8) Harry Kane – 23 caps (of 107)",

      "Barcelona (24)",
      "Two players have won the World Cup Golden Boot outright without reaching the semi-finals at the same tournament. Much like James Rodriguez earned a move to Real Madrid with his exploits in 2014, Spain’s other giant saw fit to bring in Gary Lineker in 1986. He played 24 of a possible 25 England games as a Barcelona player, scoring 17 goals.",

      "Milan (20), Monaco (7)",
      "With his final cap coming at Rangers under Graham Taylor in 1992, Hateley only actually made four appearances for England while plying his club trade on home soil. They all came during his more formative years at Portsmouth.",

      "Bari (7), Juventus (13), Sampdoria (13)",
      "One of two players to have earned England caps while playing for three different foreign clubs, Platt scored the Three Lions’ only goal at Euro 92 shortly after leaving Bari for Juventus. He would then have been at the 1994 World Cup as a Sampdoria player, had England actually qualified.",

      "3) Owen Hargreaves – 39 caps (of 42)",
      "Bayern Munich (39)",
      "Largely for the crime of playing club football in Germany and not becoming tabloid cannon fodder, Hargreaves was booed by a section of supporters and once described by The Sun as having ‘the public persona of a mass murderer’. Tunes were very much changed after an excellent 2006 World Cup but the midfielder was always on the right side of that argument.",

      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Friday 13 June 2025 12:16, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres through intermediaries, with Ruben Amorim a big admirer of his former striker; Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games last season; United also expected to bid again for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Man City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting; Sweden international is in-demand after a sensational spell in Portugal which has sent his value soaring; Gyokeres has also attracted interest from Premier League rivals Arsenal",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 15:13, UK",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",
