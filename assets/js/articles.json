      "Arsenal host Brighton on Saturday afternoon in what is another must-win game for the Premier League title contenders. The Seagulls have already made the trip to the Emirates Stadium once already this season, where they were beaten 2-0 in the Carabao Cup back in October.",
      "Brighton’s in-form striker Danny Welbeck was involved on that occasion, coming off the bench to applause and adoring chants from fans of his former club. The 35-year-old will be hoping for a more successful outing for his side in N5 this time around, which is easier said than done when facing Mikel Arteta’s Gunners.",
      "Of course, Welbeck shared a dressing room with Arteta for several years. But the Englishman is currently enjoying the finest form of his career, having netted seven goals in 16 Premier League appearances this season, albeit currently struggling with a back injury.",
      "He has managed 0.64 goals per 90 minutes with a goal conversion rate of 28%, making him the joint fifth top scorer in the top flight this season. Welbeck was similarly impressive last season with 10 goals in 30 league appearances, with his latest hot streak sparking suggestions of an outside chance of making Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup.",
      "The majority of Welbeck’s England caps came early on in his career when he still played for Manchester United. The then-promising forward realised a childhood ambition when Sir Alex Ferguson promoted him to the first-team squad in the late noughties.",
      "His breakthrough came in the 2011/12 season when he scored 12 goals, which remains his best season tally to date. Welbeck picked up several major trophies during his spell at Old Trafford, including the 2012/13 Premier League title, though his United future was thrown into doubt after Ferguson’s retirement.",
      "During David Moyes' short tenure, Welbeck was frequently deployed out wide and his opportunities became even more limited when Louis van Gaal took charge. That led to a shock £16million deadline day move to rivals Arsenal in 2014, with Arsene Wenger famously snatching him from Tottenham’s grasp while in Rome for a Pope-related charity event.",
      "Later explaining his bold decision to leave his boyhood club, Welbeck said: \"At the time I was playing on the left-wing a lot and in a 4-4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can't make an impact on the game. I can play it to the best of my ability but that's not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.\"",
      "He continued: \"You start to have thoughts but at that time you're still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game - that's just me, I'm not going to change that. But you do start to think about what's best for you.\"",
      "Then-United boss Van Gaal made sure to take a swipe at Welbeck at the time, saying: \"He has played, after [his loan spell at] Sunderland, three seasons at Manchester United but he doesn't have the record of [Robin] Van Persie or [Wayne] Rooney and that is the standard.\"",
      "Welbeck, determined to silence his critics, became a fan-favourite at Arsenal thanks to some crucial goals, including three against his former side, and two FA Cup triumphs. But his five years in north London were marred by repeated injuries.",
      "He left the Gunners in 2019 off the back of a broken ankle suffered in the Europa League group stage, having scored 32 goals in 126 appearances for the club.",
      "A difficult campaign with Watford followed in 2019/20 as the side were relegated. Welbeck then made one of the best decisions of his career by joining Brighton as a free agent in October 2020, while Graham Potter was still in charge.",
      "Welbeck has since racked up more appearances and goals for the Seagulls than either of the two Premier League giants he represented in the past, managing 44 finishes in 179 matches. While not a particularly impressive goal-scoring ratio, the last two seasons have seen the former England international develop into a more mature finisher in front of goal.",
      "This season, he is well on track to reach double figures in all competitions for the fifth time in his career. Speaking about his goal-scoring run, Welbeck told The Argus earlier in the season: \"I'm happier than ever. I think the main thing for me is the consistency of staying on the pitch and getting a rhythm of playing game after game after game.",
      "\"Unfortunately, throughout my career, I've had some really big injuries that have maybe derailed that, and it's difficult. You have to try and get back into form, you have to try and get back to match fitness and that sort of stuff. But the last couple years have been really good, and I'm feeling really good. Long may it continue.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "With the January transfer window just around the corner, Old Trafford is once again buzzing with excitement and anticipation. Manchester United are no strangers to busy windows, although their record in the winter market has been decidedly mixed.",
      "For every Bruno Fernandes and Nemanja Vidic there's been an Alexis Sanchez and a Dong Fangzhuo. January has often proved a tricky period form-wise for the Red Devils too, but shrewd business next month could provide the spark Ruben Amorim's side need to kick on and mount a serious push for a Champions League place.",
      "Links to big-name arrivals have been circulating for weeks, alongside rumours of high-profile departures. While no deals have been completed yet, one thing is certain: when it comes to Manchester United and the transfer window, drama is never far away. With that in mind, here are the latest United-related headlines:",
      "Amorim has admitted that it would be \"hard\" to sanction a loan exit for Kobbie Mainoo, particularly if United don't source a replacement for him. Mainoo has spent the bulk of the season watching on from the subs' bench, leaving his United future - and his spot in England's World Cup squad - in serious jeopardy.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window and is expected to push for an exit again in January. But with Amorim's squad looking a little light in midfield at the moment, particularly after Fernandes limped off against Aston Villa last weekend, his request may once again be denied.",
      "\"If we are not getting someone [in], then we are shorter [in midfield],\" the Portuguese manager said. \"Even with a full squad, we are shorter when something can happen here.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility, we are dealing with all these issues and in your head, my head, and everyone's heads, we need to win every game, it doesn't matter, there are no excuses, so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution [new signing].\"",
      "When asked whether Mainoo could kick on when he returns to fitness in the absence of Fernandes, Amorim said: \"He will have the opportunity that he has all the time. He played in different positions and we talk about the position of Casemiro - he can do that. He can play, if you play with three, like we did in the last game, the position of Mason Mount in this game, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United. That is my feeling, so he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football, even in two days.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly considering a surprise move for former academy graduate James Garner. The 24-year-old spent nine years at Old Trafford and made seven senior appearances before joining Everton in 2022, following loan spells at Nottingham Forest and Watford.",
      "Garner has since established himself as a regular at Goodison Park and, according to the Daily Mail, United are monitoring the possibility of a cut-price reunion. His Everton contract expires at the end of the season, giving the Red Devils a chance to bolster their midfield at minimal cost, with the Merseyside club likely keen to avoid losing him for nothing in the summer.",
      "A return for Garner could open the door for Mainoo to leave on loan and may prove particularly important if Manuel Ugarte - also linked with an exit - leaves the club in January. While United continue to track higher-profile midfield targets such as Carlos Baleba, Elliott Anderson and Adam Wharton, Garner represents a more economical alternative.",
      "Crucially, he would require little time to settle, given his familiarity with the club, and offers reliable energy, work rate and depth in midfield. Garner made just two Premier League appearances for United but featured more frequently in the Europa League, with all seven of his senior outings coming during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince once shamed the club's supporters for their reaction to him joining Liverpool. And he put the Anfield faithful on a pedestal in comparison, crediting the Kop for their response after he departed Merseyside.",
      "Ince, 58, eventually found his way to Wolves, who make their own trip to Anfield on Saturday. And there's no comparing his relationship with Liverpool's loyalists compared to those at Old Trafford.",
      "The former England international, who has taken aim at United fans before, is understood to have fallen out with Sir Alex Ferguson prior to joining Inter Milan in 1995. However, any vitriol from United fans is largely due to the fact 'The Guv'nor' later joined bitter nemeses Liverpool.",
      "Ince captained Middlesbrough against United and later took the armband with Wolves when he again returned to Old Trafford over the years. And while he's always had a fond relationship with Liverpool's support, the same can't be said for those in Manchester.",
      "\"I get a lot of grief from Manchester United fans and I can't understand it,\" said Ince back in 2002. \"They should remember I was part of the team that took the title back to Old Trafford for the first time in 26 years.",
      "\"I sweated blood and shed tears in my six years at United and I think I should be respected for that. But all I get is stick whenever I go there because Ferguson once called me a 'big-time Charlie' in some television programme. So now it's a case of, 'Let's wind him up again.'\"",
      "Ince, who won two Premier League titles and two FA Cups at United, went on to acknowledge he \"didn't leave Liverpool in the best circumstances\" after clashing with then-manager Gerard Houllier. However, it wasn't enough to make the fans turn on him.",
      "In fact, he put the Reds supporters in a bracket of their own when discussing the contrast between the two fanbases years later. And those in attendance for the Christmas showdown against Wolves will be hoping to prove much of his praise remains accurate to this day.",
      "\"Liverpool European nights, you can’t beat them,\" he said on the Blood Red podcast in 2019. “They’re special and it is iconic with all the flags. It is amazing. I think the atmosphere depends on the time, doesn’t it? When we look at Old Trafford, because it is so vast now, it is so corporate, it’s not the atmosphere that you do get at Liverpool.",
      "\"I love the Liverpool people. They come and support the team, they know football and they back their players. But one thing about the two teams, you never see them boo their players off, or very rarely. They are understanding fans. They are different atmospheres in different ways, but I like the way Liverpool look after their players, look after their own.\"",
      "Following a dire run of form in recent months, Liverpool now find themselves seeking a fourth straight win at home to Wolves. Victory on Saturday would at least temporarily take Arne Slot's men into fourth, with Chelsea set to host Aston Villa later this evening.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim says Mason Mount wanted to play on after picking up an injury against Newcastle. However, the Manchester United head coach said the club couldn't afford to risk losing another midfielder for an extended period.",
      "United were down to the bare bones against Eddie Howe's side, with captain Bruno Fernandes, midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and centre-backs Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire among those missing. They also saw Mount forced off at half-time, with teenager Jack Fletcher taking his place for the second 45 minutes.",
      "\"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",
      "Despite the absences, Amorim's team ground out a hard-fought victory thanks to a rare clean sheet. Patrick Dorgu was the unlikely hero, volleying home his first goal for the club in style, and the Danish international impressed in a more advanced role than the one he is used to.",
      "\"It was a good hit. I didn't know I could do that, but I was very happy to score my first goal in this stadium as well. It was amazing,\" Dorgu said after the victory.",
      "\"I just took what [Amorim] told me to work on my confidence and stuff. I think I did well today. I just looked at the ball, saw it drop, and I just hit it. I've been practicing in training, so I think that's what helped me.\"",
      "Amorim also said last December's 2-0 defeat at home to Newcastle played on his mind when making the unexpected decision to switch to a back four. \"In the first half, I think we showed that I felt that was the only way to create more danger, to have more opportunities was with the back four with a lot of guys inside,\" he said.",

      "Manchester United climbed to fifth in the Premier League standings following a 1-0 victory over Newcastle, thanks to a tactical switch by Ruben Amorim. Despite being under pressure for much of the second half, United managed to maintain their narrow lead for more than an hour.",
      "The solitary goal came from an unexpected avenue. Patrick Dorgu capitalised on a partially cleared long throw, volleying it into the bottom corner from just inside the Newcastle box to score what proved to be the winner. United also hit the woodwork through Benjamin Sesko, but saw their opponents do the same when Lewis Hall went close.",
      "In the end, a significant rearguard action was required. United haven't been known for their clean sheets this season so this will have felt all the more significant.",
      "Now it's time for Amorim's side to take their win forward and get a run of results after some unlikely heroes stepped up. Here are our player ratings after The Red Devils dug deep.",
      "Made a solid save from Bruno Guimaraes in the first half and remained steady as Newcastle ramped up the pressure after the break.",
      "Returned to his familiar right-back role and joined the attack in the second half. He was tested by Anthony Gordon and had to track back to contain Lewis Hall as United aimed to preserve their lead.",
      "Starting Heaven ahead of Leny Yoro was a vote of confidence from Amorim and he performed well against Nick Woltemade. His confidence seems to be returning after a period out of action.",
      "Won a header against Woltemade in the first half and rediscovered his passing form. Named captain upon his return and defended admirably.",
      "His first start at left-back in 18 months after an extended spell as one of Amorim's three centre-backs. Had a few shaky moments but overall coped well and managed to keep Jacob Murphy at bay in the second half.",
      "His Cruyff turn in the first half epitomised the confidence with which United were playing. Although his possession play could still improve, he fought hard when not in control of the ball.",
      "The Brazilian's substitution early in the second half was unexpected. He missed a promising opportunity early on and failed to dominate the game post-interval.",
      "Scored his goal in some style and his confidence visibly soared afterwards. He was diligent in defence and continued to pose a threat when attacking. His best performance for United yet.",
      "Once again, he set the pace with excellent pressing in the first half and some great link-up play. If he's now out injured, as feared, it would be a significant loss.",
      "He was dynamic in the first half but struggled to make as much of an impact after the break.",
      "A marked improvement from recent performances. He hit the bar with his last touch of the game but held the ball well in the first half and appeared stronger.",
      "Initially taken aback by the game's speed and physicality, but he adjusted well. He made one good pass to put Dorgu behind Miley.",
      "Demonstrated good game-reading skills at right-back and contributed to a solid defensive effort.",

      "Manchester United put some early pressure on the teams above them with a hard-fought win at home to Newcastle on Boxing Day. Patrick Dorgu scored the winner, enjoying the freedom given to him by head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "United had an early sight of goal when Casemiro rose highest to meet a corner from the left but he couldn't keep his header down. They kept plugging away, though, and were rewarded when Dorgu volleyed home a stunning opener midway through the first half.",
      "They were close to a second just before the hour mark when Benjamin Sesko's effort beat Aaron Ramsdale but clipped the top of the bar. Newcastle hit the woodwork themselves moments later, though, with Lewis Hall's 25-yard effort crashing back off the bar with Senne Lammens flailing.",
      "The visitors continued to put the pressure on as the game ticked on, with Anthony Gordon dragging an effort wide. The cavalry arrived moments later, with Eddie Howe introducing Yoane Wissa, Harvey Barnes and Joelinton as his side chased a leveller.",
      "Diogo Dalot missed a golden chance for a second, breaking beyond the Newcastle back-line but lifting his effort over the bar, while Matheus Cunha dragged an effort of his own well wide after a driving run. One goal was enough, though, and here are our talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "Nearly 11 months after joining Manchester United, Patrick Dorgu finally has his first goal for the club. It was a thumper, too, with the Dane running onto Nick Woltemade's headed clearance and thumping the ball out of the reach of Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Former Lecce star Dorgu clearly had an eye for goal after getting his opener, putting Ramsdale to the test with a low right-footed effort before half-time. He spent the whole game high up the pitch, be that on the right or the left, and caused problems throughout.",
      "Earlier in the season, Ruben Amorim said he wanted to see Dorgu show more of his Denmark form in a United shirt. Odds are this was the kind of thing he was after.",
      "Manchester United saw Bruno Fernandes forced off against Aston Villa, and that will have been a worry. In their last seven league games without their captain in the starting XI, they had taken just one point.",
      "Amorim recognised it would be a tall order making up for the skipper's absence but insisted United had options. Indeed, for the first 45 minutes you'd have been hard-pressed to tell which was the team missing a key player.",
      "United looked down to the bare bones late on, and there was even a rare outing from the bench for Tyrell Malacia. They weren't doing things the easy way, but they won't complain about the result.",
      "After dismissing the idea time and time again, Ruben Amorim appeared to abandon his usual back three - at least at the start of the game. Patrick Dorgu moved into a right wing role in front of Diogo Dalot, with Luke Shaw staying wide at left-back as Ayden Heaven partnered Lisandro Martinez in the middle.",
      "Now, don't get us wrong, there's every chance the change was made out of pure necessity. Both Noussair Mazraoui and Amad are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, robbing United of two more natural wing-back options, while Dorgu might also have been used there were he not filling in for another AFCON absentee in Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Certainly, the move appeared to catch Newcastle by surprise. A message arrived with Lewis Hall during a stoppage, allowing the visitors to put their own adjustments into force.",
      "United remained on top before adding an extra centre-back in the form of Leny Yoro. That too was a bait-and-switch, though, with the Frenchman moving to right-back and Dalot thrust forward onto the wing.",
      "Before kick-off, some United fans were making the case for Jack Fletcher to start. The teenager had made his Premier League debut on Sunday and might have fancied his chances with Fernandes injured, but instead started on the bench.",
      "At the start of the second half, though, Mason Mount's withdrawal gave the youngster his chance. That meant an advanced role to begin with, and Fletcher was forced to be flexible as others were withdrawn.",
      "Fletcher's twin brother Tyler was also on the bench for United, among a youthful selection, with Tyler Fredricson introduced late on. United might be far from full strength, but the future is starting to look bright.",
      "This time last year, United put in one of their most miserable first half displays of the early part of Ruben Amorim's tenure. They found themselves 2-0 down inside 20 minutes before Amorim ruthlessly substituted Joshua Zirkzee before half-time.",
      "It was a different story this time. Tonight, Amorim's side were the ones starting quickly and their opponents - barring a few brief flashes - didn't really get a foothold until the second period.",
      "There was even time for Zirkzee to pursue a redemption arc on his personal level after arriving for the final half-hour. It was Newcastle doing most of the attacking by then, though, with the hosts' task one of containment, but revenge will have no doubt been sweet.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim named not one but two Fletcher brothers on his bench for the Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Boxing Day. Jack made his Premier League debut less than a week earlier, coming on as United lost to Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim is short on numbers, with Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo both injured. He expects Mainoo to be back sooner than captain Fernandes, and will have been grateful to be able to welcome back Casemiro after a one-game ban.",
      "The Fletcher twins, sons of former United midfielder Darren, joined the Red Devils from Manchester City's academy in 2023. A reported fee of £1.25million was enough to bring the pair to Old Trafford, where they have been playing at age group level.",
      "Darren was a Scotland international during his playing career, winning 81 senior international caps. Tyler is also in the Scotland youth set-up, but Jack has instead opted for England.",
      "\"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that's why when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones. So, we'll find solutions to play,” Amorim told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "The brothers were born in England while their dad was part of United's first team under Sir Alex Ferguson, meaning they could choose to represent either England or Scotland. Ferguson's team actually had a game on the day of their birth, but Darren wasn't involved as he'd been sidelined with an ankle ligament injury at the time.",
      "Jack has opted to represent the country of his birth at international level, though he also played for Scotland's Under-16s when he was younger. He played twice for Will Antwi's England Under-19 side during the November international break, scoring in a 4-0 victory over Scotland.",
      "Tyler was on the opposite team that day, captaining the Scottish selection. He also scored his first goal at Under-19 international level in a 2-2 draw away to Latvia earlier that month.",
      "United fans were excited to see both brothers on Amorim's bench for the Newcastle game. \"So happy to see the Fletcher twins on the bench together. What a moment for them and their family,\" one wrote.",
      "\"It must be a proud moment for the Fletcher family,\" a second said. Others, meanwhile, made it clear they would have liked to see Jack Fletcher start the game ahead of Manuel Ugarte, who struggled against Villa on Sunday.",
      "Another became painfully aware of the passage of time when looking at the teamsheet. \"From watching Darren Fletcher during his prime back in college to this, football ageing just felt real again,\" they said.",

United made five new signings in the summer, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all moving to Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim and Co. will be determined to move up the standings with a victory when they face Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night.",
      "One player who has already seemingly shown why United were determined to acquire his signature is Mbeumo. The Cameroon international is currently with his country at the Africa Cup of Nations, and could be absent for another month while the tournament remains ongoing.",
      "United spent weeks being linked with signing Mbeumo before eventually getting a deal over the line worth up to £70million.",
      "A report in the Daily Mail has claimed that United's recently appointed head of data research, Mike Sansoni, played a key role in bringing Mbeumo to Old Trafford.",
      "Sansoni previously worked for the Mercedes Formula One team for 11 years in a similar role before making the switch to United.",
      "The report claims that the data compiled by Sansoni and his team showed that United signing Mbeumo was the \"closest\" they could get to signing Salah from Liverpool.",
      "Mbeumo has scored seven goals across 17 appearances so far for United, with six of those coming in the Premier League.",
      "The 26-year-old is not the only player that United are missing due to the Africa Cup of Nations, with Amad Diallo (Ivory Coast) and Noussair Mazraoui (Morocco) also competing in the tournament for their respective countries.",
      "Before Mbeumo left Manchester to compete at AFCON for Cameroon, Amorim named the forward in the starting line-up for all 16 of their Premier League matches so far this season.",

      "Garner has been turning heads with his performances for David Moyes' squad this season and is entering the final six months of his contract at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. According to the Daily Mail, United see Garner as a cost-effective option, as they plan to splash out on Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson in the summer.",
      "Anderson's transfer fee is expected to exceed £100m, a sum United can't afford to shell out in January.",
      "Everton are currently in negotiations with Garner over a new contract, with the club keen to secure a deal before the January transfer window opens next week.",
      "While Everton have the option to extend Garner's contract by another year, they're eager to lock down the adaptable midfielder to a longer-term deal.",
      "Garner caught the attention of England manager Thomas Tuchel after his standout performance in Everton's victory over United at Old Trafford earlier this month. The report suggests that United are keen to bring him back to Old Trafford in early January.",
      "Garner is a product of United's academy, having joined the club as an Under-8 and worked his way up to the first team, making his debut at just 17-years-old against Crystal Palace.",
      "Should Garner make a shocking return to Old Trafford, it could set off a chain reaction regarding departing players.",

      "While Keane occasionally allows glimpses of his kinder, gentler self on social media, an Irish doctor has now shared an extraordinary memory from his Manchester United days that paints him in a very different light.",
      "Dr Niamh Ni Loinsigh recounted how Keane once arrived unexpectedly at a children's hospital in his hometown of Cork, where his presence made a profound difference to a gravely ill patient, providing \"the boost and the energy that they needed\".",
      "She explained that she had \"debated long and hard\" about whether to make the story public, but decided it was worth telling because \"people need to hear something nice\".",

      "She went on to add: \"The closest thing I ever witnessed to a Christmas miracle was facilitated I think by Roy Keane. This was 20 years ago and we were looking after a patient who was very, very unwell and it came to a point we weren't really sure if they were going to make it.",

      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner will not sign a new contract at Selhurst Park, according to reports. The 51-year-old is said to have made the decision surrounding his future and that means he now looks set to depart the Eagles at the end of the season, when his contract expires, unless things change.",
      "The reports come following intense speculation on the Austrian's next steps with the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and even Bayern Munich mooted with an interest - prior to Vincent Kompany's switch from Burnley. Glasner has steadied the ship in south London after succeeding Roy Hodgson, guiding Palace to their first-ever FA Cup triumph after Eberechi Eze's goal was enough to beat Manchester City 1-0 at Wembley, last season.",
      "His heroics have continued with Palace qualifying for the UEFA Conference League play-offs, with games-in-hand, as their next target is winning their remaining fixtures and bypassing the extra European matches to qualify for the knockout stages, and steering them to within three points of the top-four after 17 matches.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Glasner has decided that he will not extend his spell at Palace, meaning his two-and-a-half-year stint will come to an end in June when his current deal expires.",
      "In a tweet, he wrote: \"Understand Oliver Glasner plans not to sign new deal at Crystal Palace... Austrian manager made his decision with next steps to follow + focused on continuing his excellent work this season.\"",
      "The 51-year-old had performed similar heroics over in Germany with Eintracht Frankfurt after winning the Europa League in 2022, beating Scottish Premiership side Rangers on penalties in the final.",
      "And, over recent months, he has been touted as a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Arne Slot following their struggles at Manchester United and Liverpool, respectively.",
      "The Red Devils head coach has been under pressure after enduring difficulties heeding United's downturn in form, losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur last term with that, in turn, denying European football at Old Trafford this year.",
      "However, there has been no suggestion Glasner would, formally, be in line to succeed Amorim should the former Sporting CP head coach be relieved of his duties. United's minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe previously backed the Portugues and suggested that Amorim would need three years to prove himself.",
      "Glasner has been rumoured as one proposed successor to Amorim, but has previously refused to be drawn on the speculation over taking up the Theatre of Dreams hot-seat.",
      "\"As I said, I try to keep it at bay, whether I'm successful or unsuccessful, partly for self-protection,\" he said.",
      "\"A few years ago, I got into the habit of living in the here and now and enjoying it.",
      "\"It's simply better when you don't lose 19 games than when you don't win 19. Then the atmosphere at the training ground in the morning is simply better; everything is easier.",
      "\"I'm no less ambitious, no less demanding, and just as annoyed when we lose, like now. Even if it was the first defeat in six months: I'm one of the worst losers in the world, and I'm still annoyed about it today.\"",
      "After a period of uncertainty with two spells under Hodgson - as well as a period with Arsenal great Patrick Vieira in charge - Palace have emerged as European contenders.",
      "Back in October, Glasner revealed he was in talks with Palace, over a possible extension at Selhurst Park. However, the new reports suggest that the negotiations have reached an impasse.",
      "He said: \"We are talking almost every day. It is not that I need conditions or I want something, Crystal Palace wants to be successful, to continue this pathway and not just the last 18 months.",
      "\"What we are always discussing is how can we have the best chance to continue this pathway?",
      "\"Oliver Glasner does not have the final solution and Steve Parish doesn't have (it), but we discuss about it, what is possible, what we can do. Working together and having a relationship together just makes sense if you have the same goals, the same vision, because otherwise you can't be successful.",
      "\"Wherever it is, in any company, if two leaders have different visions, then you go separate ways and you can't achieve your goal, and that is what we are talking about.",
      "\"If we can find the same pathway, the same goal - not for Oliver Glasner, (but) for Crystal Palace - then we will end the talks, and if we don't find (it) we will also end the talks.\"",
      "The summer transfer window, meanwhile, saw Palace endure a frustrating time as they lost FA Cup hero, Eze, to Arsenal and were on the brink of losing club captain Marc Guehi to Liverpool before the plug was pulled on a deadline day move. There is still a threat of Palace losing their skipper with the Reds among the clubs pushing to sign the England international on a free transfer next summer, when his deal expires.",
      "On the incomings front, it was an equally difficult time for Glasner, initially signing Walter Benitez from PSV Eindhoven before a late splurge saw Borna Sosa, Yeremi Pino and Jaydee Canvot sign with Christantus Uche making a loan move from Getafe.",
      "At the end of August, meanwhile, Glasner voiced his frustration about the lack of transfer activity - something he blamed for their slow start in 2024.",
      "\"I can't do anything,\" he said. I can't sign a player's contract. We have to act. We need this. This is Crystal Palace's future. It's easy to add numbers, we need to add the right players.",
      "\"The profile has been defined for months, for months. Also it's not surprising for everyone that Ebs left, because five days earlier we couldn't have done anything if he leaves (due to his release clause).",
      "\"We knew that this chance is very high that this would happen, and honestly, I say it like it is, we missed the chance to replace him early enough. That's completely our fault, and nobody else's fault.\"",

      "The January transfer window looks set to be a busy one at Manchester United. But unlike in the summer, it's outgoings that are expected to grab the most headlines.",
      "Ruben Amorim is a year into the job and the makeup of the Red Devils' squad has already changed drastically. Several players signed by previous managers have been shifted, with more still on the chopping block.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe infamously put virtually every player up for sale in the summer which saw names such as Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony depart. With United still yet to find consistency in the Premier League, clubs chiefs are willing to offload dead wood in order to fund their ongoing rebuild.",
      "A number of academy players are also waiting by the exit door ahead of potential departures. Even those who've already been out on loan could be on the move, too.",
      "The most advanced potential move ahead of the window opening, Joshua Zirkzee could be a Roma player very soon. The Athletic report that a loan with an obligation to buy offer has been put on the table via intermediaries, with United now considering it.",
      "Personal terms aren't expected to be a problem, as Netherlands international Zirkzee wants to join Roma and make a bid to play at the World Cup next summer. However, clubs-to-club talks regarding the 24-year-old haven't yet taken place.",
      "Who should Manchester United sign in January? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "Yet to play a minute this season, it appears that Tyrell Malacia's departure from Old Trafford is a matter of when not if. A long-term injury layoff has effectively ruined the Dutch left-back's career at United.",
      "Malacia, 26, spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven but it wasn't made permanent. His contract with United expires in June.",
      "Now officially recalled by United, Toby Collyer is expected to be loaned out for the second time this season once he recovers from a calf injury. The 21-year-old midfielder recently returned to Old Trafford for treatment, having been playing regular football at West Bromwich Albion.",
      "But when he returns to fitness, Collyer won't be heading back to the Hawthorns. The former Brighton prospect is instead set to go on another temporary move.",
      "One player who could stay with the same loan club is Harry Amass. The left-back, 18, joined Sheffield Wednesday for the first half of the season and he's been a rare bright spot at Hillsborough amid their struggles.",
      "Amass' performances have seen other Championship clubs take notice. Wednesday are hoping to extend his stay until the end of campaign, as they battle to avoid relegation.",
      "Having been signed by United in a deal worth up to £7million in July, Diego Leon has exclusively played in the academy after making first-team appearances during pre-season. The Paraguayan left-back is still adapting to English football, so a loan would make sense.",
      "Still only 18, however, United may wait until next season to give Leon first-team opportunities either elsewhere on at Old Trafford. In October, the teenager earned his first senior call-up for Paraguay and made his debut against South Korea, showing how highly regarded he is after making his name at Cerro Porteno.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim was compelled to reshuffle his team for the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa in their last match, with Casemiro benched due to an accumulation of five bookings, the latest of which came against Bournemouth.",
      "The Portuguese coach is already stretched thin, with Noussair Mazraoui, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad unavailable due to their participation in the Africa Cup of Nations.",

This is another blow for United, who have just lost their midfield maestro, Bruno Fernandes, for a while due to a hamstring injury sustained in the loss to Aston Villa.",

      "Eddie Howe has confessed he might not remain in the Newcastle hot seat long enough to witness the club's unveiling of either a revamped stadium or enhanced training facilities.",
      "Merely 12 months ago, the Magpies appeared miles ahead of Boxing Day rivals Manchester United, yet now find themselves trailing the Red Devils in the Premier League standings and could fall six points adrift should they stumble at Old Trafford.",
      "New boardroom chief David Hopkinson has set his sights on propelling Newcastle into the elite tier by 2030, though the Tyneside outfit may well begin 2026 languishing in the league's lower reaches.",
      "Chief executive Hopkinson cautioned this month that Newcastle will remain at St James' Park in its present state for \"years to come\" whilst enhancement work continues at their existing Benton training headquarters. Renovation plans for the club's neighbouring Academy facilities are already in motion.",
      "However, Howe, who has managed just six victories from 17 fixtures this season, offered a sobering glimpse into his long-term prospects before the crucial encounter at United.",
      "When quizzed about the club's communication with supporters regarding stadium relocation and facility upgrades - with Saudi backers PIF still unable to finalise new ground proposals five years post-takeover - a frank Howe, despite having at least three years remaining on his deal, remarked: \"It (messaging) is important, but there are other things that are important - it has to be right.",
      "\"If there is extra time taken to make the right decisions, and I'm not across the day-to-day decision-making process, so the stadium project is correct and it's the right one for Newcastle for however many years the club are there, then take the extra time.",
      "\"It's the same with the training ground. You need the right site and designs. I would rather it was correct than rushed. I know there's a 99.9 per cent chance that I'm not going to see either in my position, but I'm still passionate about making sure it's there for the future generations of Newcastle, whether that's supporters or players.",
      "\"The board recognise how important that is too. So I think the ambition and drive is there to do it and work is going on behind the scenes. There just needs to be a bit of patience to make sure it's the right solution for everybody.\"",
      "Howe went on to describe the club's long-term vision on Tyneside as being stuck in \"limbo\". The manager explained: \"Fundamentally, looking at the club with a broader view, you look at the training ground, stadium, that part of the club is in limbo at the moment.",
      "\"In terms of which direction the club is going to take, that would be a big step forward to get clarity on that and to take everything into the future in a really positive way, it would have a game-changing effect on everything.",
      "\"I am also talking about the academy in that. The brilliant work that goes on down there, if we can move everything forward in terms of facilities, not that I believe facilities are the be all and end all, they are a great way of setting standards higher and showing your ambition in a clear and strong way.",
      "\"That would be a game-changer when that happens. The ambition is there from everyone to make that happen.",
      "\"In terms of the team, I think the way we play is key. If we can really work on our identity and clarity of our vision, I and the coaching staff, work on what we believe and ultimately end up a successful period at Newcastle.",
      "\"We have to work on that like we do every day with really strong resolve, and the players are left in no uncertain terms what we expect. I think we will be a better team for that.\"",
      "As Newcastle gear up to bid farewell to 2025, they'll do so with silverware proudly displayed in the St James' Park trophy room after breaking their 70-year barren spell. Their European Cup ambitions remain alive and kicking as spring approaches.",
      "Howe refused to let negativity overshadow what has been a remarkable year, explaining: \"The last 12 months, I think, as a whole have been unbelievable for us because we finally won a trophy, and when I came here, that was the big aim – after staying in the league – to try to win a trophy.",
      "\"Of course, then you look at Champions League qualification, and we're in the middle of that and it's a great experience again to be in the Champions League and we're desperate to stay in the competition.",
      "\"Overall, sometimes it's really good to take that bird's eye view of everything. You'd say it's been a great 12 months.\"",
      "Yet only securing a result at Old Trafford will silence Howe's doubters. Discussing the upcoming clash, Howe commented: \"Statistically, they're a lot stronger than last year. They've seen big improvements in their general performances. They've been competitive and, attacking-wise, they have some big threats.",
      "\"I think it'll be a really good game, a tough game, for us and a good opportunity at Christmas to enjoy the magnitude of these games. The atmosphere will be special but we haven't played them previously, I think we expect a slightly different Man United.\"",

      "European giants Napoli and Bayern Munich hold an interest but despite not giving him a single start in the Premier League this season, Amorim views him as part of his long-term plans. It comes just a week after the Red Devils boss told Mainoo that he needs to 'fight for his job' before a calf injury ruled him out of last Sunday's 2-1 defeat away to Aston Villa.",
      "\"He's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling,\" Amorim declared. \"He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "The United manager added: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions; he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game [against Villa].\"",
      "Amorim then played down the chances of Mainoo leaving Old Trafford next month, saying: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",
      "Mainoo will miss the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle because of his injury. The timing is especially frustrating given that Bruno Fernandes is also sidelined and Casemiro missed the Villa game through suspension.",
      "This season, Mainoo has only started one match. That was United's humiliating loss against League Two side Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August.",
      "Also in his pre-Newcastle press conference, Amorim confirmed that no decisions have been made regarding the futures of Casemiro and Harry Maguire, who are both out of contract in June. \"There is no decision,\" the Portuguese added.",
      "\"We have a lot to do and we need to understand what is going to happen the next season, because we need to understand if there is European games what we are doing. We have so much to do in this moment. We are not thinking about that. I am really happy with them but I don't know what is going to happen.\"",

      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "When the teamsheets dropped at Old Trafford, it didn't look like it was the night when Amorim changed his ways, but Patrick Dorgu was right-wing rather than left-wing back. That change caught Newcastle by surprise.",
      "On the touchline, Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall debated a solution, while the Newcastle analysts sat in the press box tried to work out what was happening. The shrugging of shoulders showed they hadn't been expecting this.",
      "A few weeks ago, Amorim had talked of the anxiety he could feel whenever Dorgu was on the ball, so when he watched his left-wing-back-cum-right-winger settle over a dropping ball 16 yards from goal, he probably didn't expect to see a sweetly struck volley whizz past Aaron Ramsdale and into the corner of the net.",
      "Dorgu visibly grew in confidence after that. He forced Ramsdale into a smart save soon after and contributed defensively with one thunderous tackle on Lewis Hall that earned a chest bump from Casemiro, but the loss of Mason Mount to injury at half-time turned this into a rearguard effort.",
      "Fabian Schar saw a shot deflected just wide from a corner and was furious when Newcastle were denied a penalty when his shot was blocked by the arms of Lisandro Martinez. Lewis Hall hit the bar from distance and Anthony Gordon dragged a shot narrowly wide.",
      "United's attacks were few and far between. Benjamin Sesko clipped the top of the bar with a left-footed shot in his last action before being replaced by Joshua Zirkzee, part of a double change that saw Leny Yoro come on, giving the hosts the chance to drop into a back six when required.",
      "And it was needed regularly as Newcastle piled on the pressure. Diogo Dalot and Dorgu were wingers dropping in at full-back as Yoro and Luke Shaw went narrow.",
      "Senne Lammens saved from Joelinton and plucked a cross-shot from Joe Willock out of the air. Anthony Gordon should have done better than swiping a shot over after good work by Harvey Barnes, Schar looped a header onto the roof of the net and then Lewis Miley fired wide from 12 yards.",
      "It summed up Newcastle’s wastefulness in the final third as wave after wave of attack came to nothing. It wasn’t convincing from Amorim’s side, especially after the break, but after four successive defeats without Bruno Fernandes in the Premier League, victory was all that mattered.",
      "Fernandes was in the directors' box to watch his teammates go into battle without him. Amorim had talked of how difficult it was to replace the captain on Christmas Eve and with Mount missing as well, United's creativity is being tested. That this game finished with Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson on the pitch, as well as the lesser-spotted Tyrell Malacia, said everything about the resources Amorim now has at his disposal.",
      "He will need to continue to find solutions over the next few weeks, but the fist-pumps that greeted this victory showed how valuable it was, and the sight of Lisandro Martinez blowing kisses to the Stretford End was a reminder that at least one key man is back in the groove. The Argentine was vital to this defensive effort and proved to be the perfect stand-in for Fernandes.",

United were down to the bare bones after losing Mason Mount at half-time and they had to hold on during a second-half onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that temporarily moved them into fifth in the Premier League.",
      "Although United have produced more convincing performances under Amorim, the Portuguese head coach hailed it as one of his best wins during his 13 months in charge and insists the spirit they showed could be valuable in spreading belief through the squad.",

I felt we are here talking about the game, and if we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games. We need to feel we can win games without playing so well and win with spirit and togetherness.\"",
      "It was just a second clean sheet of the season and Amorim felt the luck was on United's side against Newcastle when it has deserted them at other times this season. \"The feeling is good but if you compare to other games we suffered so much more today, but in certain moments we put everything on the line,\" he said. \"We’re defending every cross, trying to push out the box, that is a good feeling to have but we had so many games we controlled much better and conceded a goal.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Ayden Heaven his place in the Manchester United starting XI is safe if he continues the rich vein of form he has shown in the last couple of games. The 19-year-old has started five games in a row for United and has raised his performance levels during that run, producing an outstanding display in a rearguard defensive effort in the 1-0 win against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Heaven, a £1million signing from Arsenal last January, has had to be patient for his chance this season but he has taken it when the opportunity arrived and was selected ahead of Leny Yoro against Newcastle. The teenager was named man of the match on TV as United showed tenacity in the second half and Amorim was delighted with the youngster's display.",
      "\"Really pleased with Ayden, he’s improving every game,\" he said. \"He’s young but you don’t feel he has a good game and slows the thinking. \"He was not playing but he trained really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. If he continues to play like that it’s going to be hard to take his place.\"",
      "Heaven started in a back four against the Magpies and that meant Patrick Dorgu reverted to right-wing, netting his first goal for the club with a stunning volley. It was his best performance since joining United last January and Amorim felt the freedom afforded the Denmark international in a more advanced role played into his hands.",
      "\"It’s the normal life of a player, sometimes you are in a good moment, sometimes you struggle. It depends on the team or the game,\" the United head coach said. \"Maybe the game today, with a lot of transitions, is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball. He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "Amorim also reserved praise for Lisandro Martinez, who captained the team in the absence of Bruno Fernandes and on his first start since February 2.",
      "\"He’s a guy with a lot of character, really good on the ball, he won the World Cup, he’s used to that stress and showed today he is a top player,\" he said. \"He’s a small guy but today he did really well against a team who has tall players.\"",

      "It's not long until the team are back in action as they return to Old Trafford on Tuesday when they host bottom of the table Wolves (8.15pm kick-off).",
      "That game will be the final one before teams can add to their squad in the January transfer window, which opens on New Year's Day.",
      "Ahead of the window opening, United have been linked with several incomings and outgoings. Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is a name that has been talked about a lot, but United have a lot of competition for the forward.",
      "Midfield is expected to be an area of priority with Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Atletico Madrid's Conor Gallagher possible targets.",
      "There is also a lot of talk over possible exits. Joshua Zirkzee has been heavily linked with a move to Roma, while Napoli are said to be showing an interest in Kobbie Mainoo. There is also talk about a possible permanent deal for on loan striker Marcus Rashford.",
      "We'll bring you all the latest updates, news and transfer rumours throughout the day in our live blog below.",
      "Another midfielder to be linked with a move to United is Everton's James Garner.",
      "The Daily Mail claim that United are paying 'close attention' to the player's situation at Everton as he enters the final six months of his current deal.",
      "Garner started his career with United before joining the Toffees on a permanent deal in 2022.",
      "Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson has emerged as United's number one midfield target, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United won 1-0 against Newcastle in the Premier League on Boxing Day. United opened the scoring in the 24th minute through a brilliant Patrick Dorgu goal, which was the difference at the break. Newcastle started the second half as the better team and came close to equalising, hitting the crossbar, but United defended bravely to see out a victory, which means they move to fifth in the table. Here are the moments you might have missed....",
      "Amorim sprang a surprise with his system in the 4-4 draw against Bournemouth earlier this month and he tweaked his tactics again on Boxing Day, starting the match with a 4-2-3-1 shape.",
      "The biggest surprise was Dorgu's position, as he started practically on the right wing. The Newcastle analysts in the press box sounded and looked confused as they deliberated among themselves.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to the 3-4-3 formation for most of his tenure, but he is finally tweaking his approach depending on the opponent, which can only be a positive. The United boss has shown a willingness to change, and the reaction from Newcastle's analysts proves why it's worth being adaptable.",
      "Newcastle struggled to get to grips with the shape in the opening exchanges. They eventually adapted and warmed to the contest, but it's encouraging to see Amorim tweaking his tactics game by game.",
      "Amorim altered his system again when he made a double change in the second half. Then Newcastle's analysts were overheard questioning whether Dalot was the right-sided winger. Amorim famously said not even the Pope could persuade him to change his tactics, but that stance has softened.",
      "Dorgu had scored just 12 goals in his career before facing Newcastle, so it's likely his wonderful volley from the edge of the box to fire United into the lead was his finest strike so far.",
      "The Denmark international savoured every second of the celebrations, but he was hungry for more after the restart, demanding the ball from his teammates at every possible opportunity.",
      "Dorgu frantically waved his arms to receive the ball in the 27th minute before looping a shot over the bar. Just moments later, he wildy gestured at Luke Shaw to pass it to him from the opposite wing.",
      "It's funny what confidence can do to a player. Dorgu looked like a new signing and delivered the kind of performance that he must produce consistently to nail down a regular starting role.",
      "Matheus Cunha had an opportunity to extend United's advantage with 10 minutes remaining, but his shot was sent wide of the post at the Stretford End, to the relief of Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Cunha was slumped on the turf and looked like he had nothing else in the tank. The forward had worked tirelessly throughout the game, and he took his time to get back to his feet.",
      "There were suggestions that Cunha's work rate could be an issue before his arrival from Wolves in the summer transfer window. Some pundits suggested he would not provide adequate defensive cover. Cunha has made that look stupid in just a few months in Manchester - he runs his socks off each game.",
      "Dorgu didn't just contribute in the final third against Newcastle, he worked back and provided defensive cover, which saw him make one of the tackles of the game on Lewis Hall.",
      "It was a brilliant challenge, which provoked a roar from the Stretford End. Dorgu also received appreciation from his teammates. Diogo Dalot slapped his back, and Casemiro pushed him as if to say 'more of that'.",
      "The crowd lapped up Casemiro's interaction. The Brazilian received praise from Amorim during the pre-Newcastle press conference and it will be difficult to find a replacement with a similar mentality next summer, but logic dictates it's the right decision to allow Casemiro to leave after the expiry of his contract.",
      "United included brothers on the bench for the first time in 12 years against Newcastle, with Amorim naming Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher in the squad. Jack was handed his debut against Aston Villa, and he was joined by his twin brother, Tyler, who made his first Premier League matchday squad.",
      "Darren Fletcher, their father, looked proud as punch in the directors' box. It was a special moment to have both brothers in the squad, and the occasion became even sweeter when Jack came onto the pitch.",
      "Mason Mount was brought off at the interval - seemingly due to an injury - and Fletcher was introduced. His father was on his feet and applauding following the final whistle.",

      "Amad was quick to give Ayden Heaven his flowers after Manchester United's win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "The youngster, who joined the Reds from Arsenal for around £1.5million last January, has struggled to rack up consistent game-time as a result of stiff competition. At the time of writing, the 19-year-old has made 14 Premier League appearances for the club, with the likes of Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire instead getting the nod over him.",
      "However, with both suffering injuries as of recent, Ruben Amorim has deployed Heaven in the heart of the defence - affording him ample opportune to impress. The youngster's capabilities were on full display on Friday evening as United played host to the Magpies, with his team running out 1-0 winners thanks to Patrick Dorgu's first-half strike.",
      "And thanks to an incredible display, which helped United keep a clean sheet against a dangerous Newcastle attack, Heaven was awarded the Player of the Match award after the full-time whistle. Taking to Instagram to mark the occasion, the centre-back wrote: \"What a game , what a team performance we have to build on this! Proud to get MOTM,\" alongside a photo carousel.",
      "And it didn't take his Manchester United team-mates long to take to the comments section to share their admiration and support, either. Despite having his hands full with international duty for the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup Of Nations, Amad wrote: \"Prime Ayden,\" with a couple of laughing emojis.",
      "Lisandro Martinez added: \"Top Ayden top!\" while Shea Lacey shared a couple of love hearts and a clapping hands emoji. Bryan Mbeumo, who is also at AFCON with Cameroon, commented: \"Well done son,\" while game-winner Dorgu said: \"My g.\"",
      "It wasn't just Manchester United players in the comments section of the post either. Arsenal wonderkid Max Dowman shared a couple of love heart eyed emojis, while Maldini Kacurri added a pair of flame icons.",
      "\"This guy here [Dorgu] helped us get there. I'm just so thankful for everyone that helped us.\"",
      "When asked about Amorim's formation, he added: \"Yeah, it was different again. Obviously I was playing on the right side. It's obviously my weaker foot, but the manager - we play loads of formations with him.",
      "\"Whatever he does, we know it's going to work and we saw today. I'm just so proud of the team.\"",
      "Having lost Amad, Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, United are faring well in the Premier League. Dorgu and Diogo Dalot were deployed as wingbacks for the clash against Newcastle, while Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha played in attacking midfield in Mbeumo's absence.",
      "As a result of the win, United climb to fifth in the Premier League standings with a tally of eight wins, five losses and as many draws after 18 games. Up next for the Reds is a home clash with a rock-bottom Wolves come Tuesday, December 30.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu's superb volley midway through the first half proved to be the difference as Ruben Amorim's side secured a precious three points. The Reds were the better side in the first half but came under huge pressure in the second with a resolute rearguard action keeping the visitors out.",
      "Lewis Hall hit the bar for Newcastle, as did Benjamin Sesko for United while Diogo Dalot missed a glorious chance on the counter for the home side. Newcastle were far superior in the second period but lacked quality in the final third and United earned just a second clean sheet of the campaign and a first home win in two months.",
      "Catch up on the action and follow the reaction with us on the blog",
      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "Read Tyrone Marshall's on the whistle analysis here",
      "United were pinned back for much of the second half and had to produce a defensive rearguard to hold on to the lead given them before the break.",

      "Dorgu is full of confidence and asking for the ball at every single opportunity.",
      "Amorim was just starting to get agitated on the touchline before that goal. United had been on the back foot for a good 10 minutes and were looking ragged. That came out of nowhere, but what a hit it was. Nobody will be anxious when Dorgu is on the ball again anytime soon.",
      "Dorgu has just scored a screamer from the edge of the box to fire United into the lead.",
      "That was an incredible technique to volley and find the bottom left corner.",

      "The Newcastle analysts in the press box have been trying to work out new pressing patterns for United’s unexpected shape. There is a fair bit of shoulder shrugging going on. Nobody expected Dorgu to start on the right wing. Howe and Tindall have been deep in discussions as well, with messages passed on to players who were clearly expecting a more familiar United set-up.",
      "Newcastle's analysts in the press box sound and look confused by how United have lined up tonight.",
      "It was a hybrid back four/back three against Bournemouth but this looks like a back four. Dalot and Shaw the full-backs and Heaven and Martinez in the middle. Dorgu has started very high on the right and is up with Cunha and Sesko at times.",
      "Casemiro had a completely free header in the box but he's unable to get it on target.",
      "It looks like a back four tonight. Dorgu has started high on the right side, similar to where Amad played in the draw against Bournemouth. Amorim is tweaking his tactics due to missing key players."

      "Ruben Amorim has explained that Lisandro Martinez is wearing the captain's armband against Newcastle because he is part of Manchester United's leadership group, which was formed in the summer. Amorim has made two changes from Villa Park last weekend, dropping Leny Yoro to the bench in favour of starting Martinez, who is skipper in the absence of Bruno Fernandes. Casemiro also returns from suspension.",
      "\"We need to perform well. We need to be physical. They [Newcastle] need to feel uncomfortable. We need to be smart - we cannot lose the ball in our half when we are too exposed or open. We know what they want and we will try to do the opposite, but we also need to play with our strengths.\"",
      "When asked about Martinez wearing the armband, Amorim said: \"We made a list at the beginning of the season, Lisandro was on that list. He is going to wear the armband but everyone needs to step up because Bruno is not here.\"",
      "He added about the youthful bench: \"They are ready to help the team. We have a short squad to give the kids an opportunity. They are really proud to be here. If we need, they will be on the pitch.\"",

      "With the January transfer window fast approaching, there is a familiar sense of excitement and expectation building around Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United are well used to hectic transfer periods, even if their outcomes in the mid-season market have been inconsistent at best. For every Bruno Fernandes and Nemanja Vidic, there has also been an Alexis Sanchez or a Dong Fangzhuo.",
      "January has frequently been a difficult time in terms of form for United, yet smart recruitment in the coming weeks could deliver the boost Ruben Amorim's team needs to press forward and launch a genuine challenge for a Champions League spot.",
      "Speculation surrounding marquee signings has been gathering pace for some time, matched by talk of notable exits. Although no agreements have been finalised so far, one thing remains clear: when Manchester United enter a transfer window, controversy and intrigue usually follow. With that in mind, here is a round-up of the latest United-related headlines.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amorim has acknowledged that allowing Kobbie Mainoo to leave on loan would be \"hard\", especially if United fail to bring in a suitable replacement. Mainoo has spent much of the campaign on the subs bench, a situation that has placed both his long-term United prospects and his place in England's World Cup squad under real threat.",
      "The 20-year-old asked to depart temporarily during the summer window and is expected to renew that request in January. However, with Amorim already short of options in central areas - a concern heightened after Fernandes was forced off against Aston Villa last weekend - another rejection looks likely.",
      "\"If we are not getting someone [in], then we are shorter [in midfield],\" the Portuguese manager said. \"Even with a full squad, we are shorter when something can happen here.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility, we are dealing with all these issues and in your head, my head, and everyone's heads, we need to win every game, it doesn't matter, there are no excuses, so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution [new signing].\"",
      "When questioned about whether Mainoo could step up once fit if Fernandes remains sidelined, Amorim explained: \"He will have the opportunity that he has all the time. He played in different positions and we talk about the position of Casemiro - he can do that. He can play, if you play with three, like we did in the last game, the position of Mason Mount in this game, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United. That is my feeling, so he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football, even in two days.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Manchester United are said to be weighing up an unexpected approach for former youth product James Garner. The midfielder, now 24, spent nine years developing at Old Trafford and featured seven times at senior level before completing a move to Everton in 2022, following loan spells with Nottingham Forest and Watford.",
      "Since arriving on Merseyside, Garner has become a dependable figure at Goodison Park and, according to the Daily Mail, United are keeping a close eye on a potential low-cost return. His current Everton deal runs out at the end of the campaign, presenting United with an opportunity to strengthen their midfield cheaply, while Everton may prefer a January sale rather than risk losing him for free.",
      "Bringing Garner back could make it easier for Mainoo to secure a loan move and could be especially significant if Manuel Ugarte - who has also been linked with a departure - exits during the winter window. Although United continue to follow more high-profile midfielders like Carlos Baleba, Elliott Anderson and Adam Wharton, Garner stands out as a cost-effective option.",
      "Importantly, he would not need time to adapt due to his history with the club and would provide dependable energy, industry and squad depth. Garner made only two Premier League appearances for United but was used more regularly in the Europa League, with all seven of his senior games coming across the 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons.",

Mainoo has not started for United in the Premier League this season. The youngster was potentially in line to receive his first start against Aston Villa last weekend, but he picked up a calf injury in training and was ruled out of that match in Birmingham.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window and could request to leave again in the January window when he returns from the sidelines. However, Bruno Fernandes picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa and United's midfield options will be lighter during his absence.",
      "Amorim admitted the moving parts could mean a potential request to leave on loan from Mainoo would be rejected. \"If we are not getting someone [in], then we are shorter,\" he said.",

      "United's target is to seal a return to European football this season, but Amorim would not predict whether his squad could qualify for the Champions League if no new signings are made in the January window.",
      "\"I think it's hard to talk about that,\" he said. \"What I can say is we have the potential to do more, and I think I can do more with the team, and I can help the team to be better. That I can say.",
      "\"If it's top four, it's different in our club, not everything around our club is so simple. We have the talent to reach it, but there is so much more than that in the team. The only thing I can say is that if we have the full squad, I think I can help them to play better and we can be better in the future.\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is facing at least one month out of action after suffering from an injury in his side's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.",
      "That's according to The Telegraph, who report that the club captain sustained a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", which saw him forced off at half-time at Villa Park.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker was seen struggling through the first half of the match, with the second half seeing him replaced by Lisandro Martinez, who took up the midfield role instead.",
      "The injury for Fernandes comes as a blow to Man United at the worst possible time, with three game-changers in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui all away on international duty with their respective nations for the Africa Cup of Nations over the next month or so.",
      "That has already seen Ruben Amorim dealt a depleted squad, which was evident with his reliance on younger players in the defeat on Sunday.",
      "The loss of Fernandes is a particularly huge blow, considering how crucial he has been to their recent uptick in form, picking up five goals and seven assists from his deeper midfield role.",
      "Speaking about the injury after the game, Amorim said: \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while. He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see.",
      "\"It's an injury and sometimes it’s bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game.",
      "\"No one is going to remember these problems, so let’s cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may finally be given a chance to shine, after calls from all sections of the fanbase for the youngster to be given an opportunity.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, despite previously proving himself at the top level, which has raised plenty of eyebrows.",
      "Mainoo was absent from the defeat at Villa Park, due to a minor injury picked up in training, which meant he couldn't be the immediate Fernandes replacement on Sunday, but could be for Boxing Day's clash with Newcastle United.",
      "With yet another injury issue, there are some big games for Amorim coming up over the next month that could see the club captain out of action.",
      "With United's last realistic chance of silverware coming in the FA Cup, the loss of Fernandes for the Brighton clash could be huge, on top of his absence for matches against rivals such as Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",
      "In his absence comes a chance for someone to step up and make themselves a hero, however.",

      "Manchester United could not return to winning ways against Aston Villa on Sunday. United suffered a 2-1 defeat after a brace from Morgan Rogers, who scored a goal in each half of the game.",
      "The Reds would have moved to fifth in the table if they had beaten Villa. They will now go into the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle sitting in seventh position in the top flight.",
      "Matheus Cunha brought the score level just before half-time, but Rogers is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League, and he punished United again following the interval.",

      "Recap what happened at Villa Park here.",
      "Amorim insists United won't rip up their January transfer plans despite losing captain Fernandes to a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes joined fellow midfielder Mainoo on the injury list after he withdrew on the eve of the game.",
      "Fernandes clutched his hamstring late in the first half at Villa Park and was forced off at the break, with Amorim confirming it was a soft tissue problem. Mainoo injured his calf in training on Saturday and couldn't be part of the squad.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "When Ruben Amorim looks under his tree on Christmas Day, he is likely to be disappointed. The Manchester United head coach could do with finding a couple of midfielders wrapped up, and no pair of socks will make up for the disappointment of not finding Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton ready to pop out of a box.",
      "Amorim suggested on Friday that United were unlikely to sign a midfielder in January, but then he didn't expect to finish the game at Aston Villa with Lisandro Martinez and Jack Fletcher in the middle of the pitch. Christmas should be a time of giving, but it's been a costly week for Amorim and United.",
      "Having seen Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, he saw Kobbie Mainoo limp out of training on Saturday and Bruno Fernandes pull up at the end of the first half. Casemiro's suspension left the outmatched Manuel Ugarte as the only senior midfielder left standing.",
      "Ugarte has fallen out of favour under Amorim, and at times at Villa Park, you could see why. His work in possession was particularly poor. He had to fill Fernandes' box-to-box role in the second half and it's difficult to make a case for a team stretched to that degree getting a result against the Premier League's in-form team.",

      "Awful from Yoro. Rogers gets that ball on the touchline and finishes from 15 yards out well inside the area, without any threat of a challenge. That is pathetic defending and all of United’s good work has been undone.",
      "That's a stunning goal from Rogers, who finds the top right corner from the left of the box.",
      "Ugarte was too weak and Yoro was hugely to blame when Rogers picked it up.",
      "Fernandes picked up a knock a few minutes ago but he has continued.",
      "United got to be happy with how things are going here. They’ve kept Villa quiet for a while now and look the better side at the moment. Starting to show some control, good spells of possession, Cunha looking lively and the Villa Park faithful starting to get really rattled.",
      "Cunha won the ball back and forced a save from Martinez, shooting from the edge of the box.",
      "Two chances fall to Sesko in quick succession and he should do better. First one is a good save from Martinez, but elite strikers would want to be scoring that. Second is the wrong option, touch round the goalkeeper wasn’t on and should have looked to lift it. A promising sign that he is suddenly in the game, however.",
      "Villa made a fast start to this game, but they've dropped off and some of the fans around the press box are beginning to sound frustrated.",
      "Sesko latched onto a ball into the box and should have done a lot better.",
      "Mount offering some advice to Sesko during a break in play. Striker feeding on scraps at the moment, but he is at least offering an outball. Ugarte has had a very shaky start, Fernandes pressing high and holding midfielder being run ragged at times. United have at least steadied the ship after a rocky opening.",
      "Mount has just been shaking his head - he doesn't look happy with the speed United are playing at.",
      "Dalot did well to bring the ball inside and play a pass over the top to Sesko, but it came to nothing.",
      "Mount has started really well and made a strong challenge just before.",
      "Villa just had three big chances. Lammens made a great save, Heaven made a superb block and Rogers came inches from scoring with a clever backheel. Villa have started full of energy and confidence."

      "That run of form is built on shaky foundations if you believe the data geeks, but Morgan Rogers is doing his best to condemn the boffins to the bin this season. He is making a habit of scoring stunners, so the solution is to make sure he can't shoot. Instead, Leny Yoro was so busy handing out gifts he should have been wearing a white beard.",
      "He was too passive against Rogers and paid the price twice. It undid a lot of the good work that United put in at Villa Park. For the second game running, they created chances and looked like a threat going forward, but failed to win. It is now two wins in eight.",
      "Villa came out of the blocks quickly, as you would expect of a team on a run of nine successive wins. Ayden Heaven twice had to block shots from Ollie Watkins, Senne Lammens made a save from John McGinn and Rogers reacted quickly to flick an Ian Maatsen drive towards goal in the six-yard box, only to see it squirm just wide.",
      "United settled their rocking ship, however, and should have led by the midway point of the half. Benjamin Sesko found himself in on goal only to be denied by a sprawling save from Emiliano Martinez. A minute later, it was a clever pass from Matheus Cunha that sent Sesko in, but he took a heavy touch when trying to round Martinez, when he should have attempted to lift a first-time finish.",
      "In a stodgy half, it was Rogers and Cunha who had looked like making something happen, and they delivered within minutes of each other. Rogers had nothing on when he picked up possession on the left touchline, but Yoro never got close to the Premier League's in-form player and let him drift into a shooting position, from where he picked his spot clinically.",
      "Thankfully for United, Matty Cash was also in the Christmas spirit. He was caught napping by Patrick Dorgu, with the ball falling to Cunha. The Brazilian had plenty to do, but his unerring finish was measured to perfection.",
      "The half-time loss of Fernandes was a hammer blow for United. The captain had stopped the game after clutching his hamstring, but continued until the break. He even had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ezri Konsa in that period, but couldn't continue. It meant Amorim had to raid his threadbare bench and the promotion of Martinez to midfield showed what he thought of the other options available to him.",
      "Martinez settled into the game quickly, and United started the second half well, but were again undone by a moment of Rogers' magic. The finish was from a similar angle after the ball bounced clear to him, and again, Yoro was too cautious in trying to stop him. His two shots were worth a combined xG of 0.07 on the spreadsheet. Unfortunately for United, the game was being played on the pitch.",
      "The consolation for Amorim was that his team was being beaten by stunners. So stretched were resources that the Portuguese called a truce with the academy, handing out two debuts, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot forced Martinez into a save and Dorgu's follow-up was blocked by Cash. The recalled wing-back then stuck a cross on Cunha's head only for the Brazilian's effort to bounce wide. Lacey managed a shot on target from distance and Mount whipped a free-kick onto the roof of the net.",
      "It was an afternoon when United could count themselves a little unlucky, but the results are flatlining again. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day. Who partners him is anyone's guess.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park. The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",
      "Amorim had hinted he could play a back four against Villa, a formation that would have meant three midfielders and would have resulted in an expected promotion for Mainoo, 20, with Casemiro suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season.",
      "But his cruelly timed injury means he won't get to add to his 212 minutes of Premier League football so far this season. With Mainoo unavailable, Amorim has stuck by his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United are short of options with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Mainoo has joined Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt on the treatment table.",
      "Amorim was asked about Mainoo during his press conference and urged him to accept his current predicament and prove him wrong, hinting he could be in the side against Villa.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" he said. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. Veron was not playing.",
      "\"So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team to win. To help Kobbie to be a better player. I'm not trying to say to Kobbie 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something.'",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobe sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, Sunday he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, is going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me for the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\""

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "With Man Utd captain Fernandes absent through injury, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte started as their central midfield pairing with Amorim bringing Leny Yoro on for the Brazilian on 61 minutes.",

      "And when asked to explain why be brought off Casemiro over other players, Amorim told reporters: “In that moment I did not want to take [Matheus] Cunha because he’s the only guy who can allow us to breathe and I put him in a No.10.",

      "“Look, Newcastle were on top anyway, I don’t want to be a pessimist if you’re a Manchester United fan watching, but I’d be surprised if this goes well in the next half hour because they look all at sea now, I’m really not sure about those substitutions.”",
      "On the performance of matchwinner Dorgu, Amorim added: “Because you put him in one position that is more in front. The responsibility is not the same. He had a little more freedom, he can take more risks, and I think it helped Patrick to play better.",
      "“They just need to understand, and Manu [Manuel Ugarte] did a very good game today, they must understand that, sometimes, you can have a good day and the next day can be worse. You have to deal with that and train well and to go forward.”",

But the streaky Cherries will soon be on an 11-match unbeaten run, making the Spaniard the most sought-after manager in Europe again.",
      "Perhaps their poor form offers the perfect time for the club’s hierarchy to sit down with Iraola and offer him a new deal. It could come across as a huge display of faith, and then Bournemouth will benefit financially when Manchester City or someone else pays a hefty compensation fee.",

He felt massively let down by chairman Steve Parish and let the media know as much, while Parish couldn’t fight his corner as losing the Austrian before 2025/26 started would’ve been an absolute disaster.",
      "It’s felt inevitable that Glasner would take the step up to a bigger club, and a disappointing summer is one of the biggest reasons he won’t renew his contract and walk away in June, if not sooner.",
      "",
      "Everton have lacked a prolific goalscorer for a while. It’s something they desperately needed to address last summer, and they did so by signing a top, young player with bags of potential in Thierno Barry. It’s safe to say it hasn’t worked out for him so far.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin, at his absolute best, scored 16 Premier League goals in 2020/21, the most for the Toffees since Romelu Lukaku backed up an 18-goal campaign with a 25-goal 2016/17.",
      "Everton should probably stick to recruiting strikers from English clubs. Their list of top scorers in each Premier League season goes as follows (centre-forwards only): Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Wayne Rooney, Lukaku x4, Nikica Jelavic, Tim Cahill, Louis Saha, Cahill, Yakubu, Andy Johnson, James Beattie, Cahill, Rooney, Tomasz Radzinski, Radzinski and Duncan Ferguson, Kevin Campbell x3, Ferguson x2, Paul Rideout, Tony Cottee x2.",
      "Jelavic and Ferguson hadn’t played in England before joining but were signed straight from Scotland. Radzinski is the only non-Brit there playing for his first English club.",
      "The moral of the story is: keep your striker recruitment a little more local, Everton.",
      "",
      "After watching Crystal Palace win their first major trophy, Fulham must’ve felt desperate to experience the same. Their summer transfer business suggests they’re happy where they are – winning sod all but comfortably avoiding relegation every season.",
      "Kevin was an exciting signing, and Samuel Chukwueze has shown promise, but it was a very underwhelming summer window for the Cottagers.",
      "",
      "As the alphabet would have it, Leeds follow Fulham, and the latter’s best decision of 2025 has created the former’s worst.",
      "Leeds were reportedly interested in signing Wilson in the summer transfer window but couldn’t get a deal over the line. Who knew that he would become a bloody revelation at Craven Cottage a couple of months later? We certainly didn’t.",
      "Daniel Farke was actually let down badly in the end after a strong start to the club’s summer business. He needed more in attack. At least Calvert-Lewin is doing well now.",
      "",
      "Choosing Jeremie Frimpong as Trent Alexander-Arnold’s replacement, picking Florian Wirtz over Rayan Cherki, and signing a player who might be the biggest flop of all flops in Premier League floppyville were big gaffes, but it’s hard to argue that they were worse decisions than waiting until deadline day to have a bid accepted for Marc Guehi.",
      "Guehi leaving could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back for Glasner at Palace, and it could have made a huge difference in an awful first half to the season for the Reds.",
      "He would’ve been able to take a struggling Ibrahima Konate out of the firing line and surely played well enough to stay in the team. Had Guehi been playing well next to Virgil van Dijk, the Liverpool captain and the two full-backs would also look a lot more comfortable.",
      "Yes, Liverpool can get Guehi for nothing next summer, but they have desperately needed him this term.",
      "",
      "This isn’t a huge error on City’s side, but a case of hindsight being a wonderful (or gut-wrenchingly frustrating) thing for young Trafford.",
      "An honourable mention is rejecting big money from Tottenham for Savinho. We’re really not sure what either side was thinking there.",
      "",
      "How long have you got with this lot? It’s pretty difficult to pinpoint the worst decision United made in 2025. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has done and said some very odd things. Ruben Amorim might’ve been sacked four or five times. Spending all of their summer budget on attackers might not have been the best move. Not signing a goalkeeper in January was also a bit silly, if not completely forced by a shoestring budget.",
      "We have landed on a specific part of their Europa League final preparation.",
      "Basically, Amorim opted for continuity and confidence by playing his strongest team in the weeks building up to the final. Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, meanwhile, rested everyone to ensure his players were fit and well-rested for an absolutely monumental game of football.",
      "Ultimately, one decision aged well, earned the club £100m, and qualified them for the Champions League. And the other decision might’ve cost United the £100m windfall and Champions League football, which Amorim swears he didn’t really want anyway.",
      "",
      "In terms of 2025 transfers, the richest club in the Premier League have had a torrid time. The £55m they spent on Elanga surely goes down as their biggest gaffe, though.",
      "He has really struggled. Like really, really struggled. We don’t want to absolutely hammer the poor lad, so we’ll leave it at that.",
      "",
      "Eight games, zero wins, two draws, six defeats, zero clean sheets, seven goals scored, 17 goals conceded, 39 days in charge, sacked 18 minutes after losing his final match.",
      "Need we say any more?",
      "",
      "If we’re poking holes in their summer recruitment, it would be that they signed quite a few African players in an Africa Cup of Nations season.",
      "AFCON will affect the Black Cats more than any other Premier League club with regular starters Bertrand Traore, Noah Sadiki, and Reinildo all representing their countries, while another important player, Habib Diarra, has returned from injury just in time to link up with his Senegal teammates. Morocco’s Chemsdine Talbi and DR Congo’s Arthur Masuaku are also away and have featured plenty this term.",
      "",
      "On paper, Spurs have a pretty good squad. But football isn’t played on paper, and clearly something is missing. Xavi Simons and Mohammed Kudus should’ve brought an X-factor to Thomas Frank’s squad, but they’ve blown very hot and cold in their early months at the club.",
      "‘Hiring Thomas Frank’ is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s maybe harsh on him because he is a good manager who is willing to adapt, but it’s more that he isn’t the right profile for Spurs.",
      "They needed someone with a proper coaching identity, which Frank unfortunately lacks. He is chopping and changing his tactics too often. We honestly don’t know if he’s an attack-minded coach or a defense-minded coach. He does lean more towards the latter, which is fine for Brentford, but not for a ball-dominant team.",
      "Hopefully Frank is given enough time to prove us wrong and does exactly that, but his first six months at Spurs have been concerning.",
      "",
      "Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? Well, it happened in January 2025. Potter replaced Julen Lopetegui, and despite defeat in his first game, we thought there was already marked improvement and that the Englishman’s long-awaited return to the dugout was going to go just fine.",
      "Alas, he was sacked in September with West Ham 19th in the Premier League. His win rate was an abysmal 24% during his time at the club. West Ham were the worst ever-present Premier League club during his tenure, accumulating 23 points, four fewer than Wolves, who were above Spurs and Man United by two points and one respectively.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has slightly steadied the ship, but we’re not fully convinced West Ham won’t sink into the Championship for the first time since 2011/12.",
      "",
      "Replacing star players like Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were the trickiest of tasks for any Premier League club last summer, and Wolves did so…very poorly.",
      "Ait-Nouri’s replacement, David Moller Wolfe, cost £10m but didn’t really come into the team until Rob Edwards joined. Less can be said about that because Ait-Nouri was important to Wolves, but his importance didn’t come close to Cunha’s.",
      "He basically was Vitor Pereira’s system. That does make replacing him almost impossible, but his importance underlined how vital it is for a relegation candidate to have a proper game-changer in attack. Leeds survived because they had Raphinha. Wolves survived because they had Cunha…and Ipswich, Southampton, and Leicester were atrocious.",
      "Tasked with filling the Cunha void were Jhon Arias and Fer Lopez, who joined for a combined £34m. Neither has impressed, and Wolves only have two points this season, which hints at more complex problems than ‘they couldn’t replace their best players very well’.",
      "READ NEXT: Pre-season predictions revisited: Just how wrong were we on Liverpool, Arsenal, Villa, Sunderland?",

      "In a way it is difficult not to admire Ruben Amorim, the dogmatic Manchester United manager appointed specifically for his unwavering faith in principles which have broken myriad negative records, delivered a 15th-placed Premier League finish and produced one of the most miserable major tournament final surrenders in modern history.",
      "The Portuguese, having realised that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have taken a Ludovico Technique-style approach to this infernal staring contest with a manager they have wedded themselves to for better or considerably worse, finally admitted he “would do 75% of things different” if offered the opportunity again.",
      "While that does beg the question of precisely how much of this year-long agony was entirely necessary, it also suggests a level of hitherto denied malleability, the sort required for any coach to succeed.",
      "But it leaves two intriguing points: what things would Amorim change? And far more fascinating: what would he not?",
      "It might ordinarily be assumed that giving Newcastle 66% of the ball at Old Trafford would fall under the 75% of things Amorim would alter but when such a sacrifice of possession is made at the altar of victory, perhaps not.",
      "And the first half especially was generally positive. Patrick Dorgu marked a fine performance on the right wing with a spectacular first goal for the club, Benjamin Sesko led the line admirably, Matheus Cunha sparkled and Lisandro Martinez helped pull it all together at the back as captain.",
      "Yet as with the other wins Amorim has overseen at Manchester United, his 25th was underpinned by questionable calls and a sense of general chaos.",
      "On the face of it, this was a Premier League win, lifting them to fifth in the table, with: a 19-year-old at centre-half partnering a player making his first start in almost a year; their three best forwards of the season either at AFCON or watching from the stands with a dodgy hamstring; a player making the second and longest appearance of his Premier League career at 45 minutes; another making his third Premier League career appearance, and first in a win; and someone playing his first game of professional football in more than seven months.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez, Jack Fletcher, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia is pure, unadulterated, found-down-the-back-of-the-sofa-in-time-for-Boxing-Day nonsense.",
      "And it just about worked. Only by technicality of the scoreline, the most important technicality of all. But those are three crucial points all the same, the sort which these players and this manager would rarely have held out for in the past.",
      "The awfulness of Newcastle helped. They had four times as many shots as their hosts in the second half and three-quarters of the ball but at no stage did they look particularly likely to decimate the deficit. Beyond the excellent Lewis Hall striking the bar it was an absurdly tiresome slog and a continuation of their away angst.",
      "Those travel travails were summed up neatly by the moment in the second half when Nick Woltemade’s clever flick allowed Jacob Ramsey time and space to move into the area, at which point he stumbled over his own feet and collapsed to the floor.",
      "Both were removed in a triple substitution around the hour mark which Eddie Howe designed to capitalise on the momentum that had long since settled in Newcastle’s favour. Yoane Wissa, Joelinton and Harvey Barnes entered as Manchester United were starting to sink deeper into their own half.",
      "Yet at no real point did Amorim’s side look like caving in. Not when Sesko – and Manchester United’s pressure-relieving forward pivot – was taken off, nor when a bemused Casemiro followed. Not when the manager substituted his two most senior defenders with backs against the wall in the 88th minute.",
      "Some of that is on Newcastle’s inability to create much of note. But it is also credit to Manchester United for digging in.",
      "And it gave Amorim an opportunity to showcase a side of himself which has been lost in the mess of the last year: his charisma.",
      "“Back four, clean sheet, Kobbie Mainoo is injured. I don’t need a press conference, we covered all the subjects, so can all go away and enjoy Boxing Day,” were his CliffsNotes from an evening in which Manchester United made hard work of putting in the hard work, only for it to actually pay off for once.",

      "Man United head coach Ruben Amorim says Bruno Fernandes is “impossible to replace” but he has to find a way against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "It’s not another symbol of Broken Britain but it is sad that there will be only one Premier League game on Boxing Day.",
      "Alexander Isak has *finally* broken his silence on his injury four days ago, but Liverpool need not worry because a perfect replacement has been identified.",
      "There is anger at the notion that Alexander Isak’s leg break was karma and not a lot else in the pre-Christmas Mailbox."

      "The 28-year-old was linked with a host of European clubs, including Man United and Barcelona, before landing in Saudi Arabia.",
      "As is the case with most players his age, it never felt like Neves’ long-term future was in the Middle East and, two-and-a-half years later, he is reportedly keen to return to Europe.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘ready to act’ under the right circumstances in January and could make a bargain signing.",
      "The Red Devils are being heavily linked with several potential targets ahead of January, including numerous possible midfielders.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd spent around £230m on signings as they landed Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "These additions have improved Ruben Amorim‘s side, but they still need upgrades in certain positions and could enter the market for signings in January.",
      "Now, a report from The Athletic has shed light on Man Utd’s January plans, with it noted that they are ‘ready to act on any opportunity that might arise for the right player, either in midfield or elsewhere on the pitch’.",
      "READ: Big Christmas Weekend: Chelsea v Aston Villa, Man City, Mason Mount, Thomas Frank",
      "The report adds: ‘United are prepared to be active in the January market, although incomings are only expected if they are able to accelerate the signing of a long-term target.",
      "‘Those at the top of United’s midfield shortlist are not expected to be attainable in January as it stands.’",
      "Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson are said to be among Man Utd’s preferred targets, but they could opt for a cheaper option in January.",
      "Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher is one option, but former Premier League CEO Keith Wyness, in a report for Football Insider, claims Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves could be available for “as low as” £15m.",
      "“Yeah, well, it’d be up to him really to decide if he’s prepared to cut his wages to come back into the Premier League. And I think he may well do that,” Wyness told Football Insider.",
      "“A lot will depend, though, on the tax ramifications of leaving Saudi early. A lot of tax consequences when you leave after a full tax year, et cetera. We obviously don’t know the personal details of how that would work out for him and where he’s domiciled and all those sorts of things will come into it.",
      "“But I think that he may be one that would come to United. I think given some of the injuries that United have had as well. Neves can play different roles, play a little bit deeper. And I think also that Amorim would be a big fan and have him there as well.",
      "“And I think linking back up with [Matheus] Cunha would be interesting as well for them. So I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the one, that might be around the 15 million mark from what I’m hearing, even as low as that for Neves.",
      "“That’s more like it in terms of a strengthening position, and I think he’d be a very good acquisition for United if they were to get him. It’s whether Al-Hilal will deal, and we’ll see what happens.”",
      "According to reports, Al Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves wants to leave Saudi Arabia and has interest from Manchester United, Newcastle and Spurs.",
      "Man Utd were reportedly the frontrunners to sign Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves in the January transfer window until Real Madrid joined the race.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided that they will ‘go all out’ for Liverpool and Manchester City target Antoine Semenyo in January.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘held talks’ over signing Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves, who is also linked with Newcastle United and Spurs.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly made a January transfer request as Fabrizio Romano reveals the truth about their rumoured interest in Tyler Adams.",
      "A former Premier League star who was on the radar of Manchester United has put off top cubs given his wages, with two options now available to him."

      "These deals have helped to improve Ruben Amorim‘s side, but they are still lacking in certain departments and this is especially the case in midfield.",

      "READ: Big Christmas Weekend: Chelsea v Aston Villa, Man City, Mason Mount, Thomas Frank",

      "Now, Romano has revealed that Gallagher is “only” available on a permanent transfer in January.",
      "“The message I am getting from Atletico Madrid on Conor Gallagher is very clear,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",

      "“Well, Brighton have been the masters. I mean, we just, we know what they’ve done with Chelsea. They’ve made a lot of money out of Chelsea with either managers or players. And I think they’re in no rush to sell. I think they’ll stick out for the price,” Wyness said.",
      "“Yes, Baleba’s form has dipped because a lot of people think it’s because of all the transfer speculation. I’m not necessarily convinced myself. I think his valuation has dipped, in my opinion, even though Brighton are very good at negotiation.",
      "“I think I would still see him going maybe in the £75m to £80m mark with some type of add-on or bonuses to get it up to make a headline number of close to £100m.",
      "“But I do think that that dip in form will affect his valuation. If he comes back into form in the second part of the season, which he could well do, then of course in the summer they’re going to be looking to keep that sort of £100m mark.",
      "“I think there’s room now to negotiate, and I think Brighton would be prepared to move on. They’ve got their replacements in place as Brighton always seem to have.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says Bruno Fernandes is “impossible to replace” but he has to find a way against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Fernandes was brought off at half-time in Sunday’s Premier League match at Aston Villa after suffering a muscle injury.",
      "The Portugal international has only missed two club matches through injury in his professional career, but is set to be absent for around a month.",
      "It’s a huge blow for United, who only know life with their captain in the starting XI. It will be interesting to see how they cope without him. They will either crumble, or, for no reason other than football being very weird at times, look significantly better.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the natural choice to replace Fernandes, but he is also injured.",
      "It’s typical of the young midfielder’s season, which has been stop-start and frustrating. Mainoo knows he is competing against Fernandes for a starting spot rather than alongside him.",
      "Dislodging the United skipper is an impossible task and his injury should have presented the perfect opportunity for Mainoo to finally stake his claim under Amorim.",
      "Instead, the United boss is without both and could move Mason Mount back into midfield to play alongside Casemiro, although centre-back Lisandro Martinez came off the bench to feature there at Villa Park.",
      "Amorim has to find a solution, but you can’t blame him for being a little tentative.",
      "Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Wednesday, Amorim said: “It’s impossible to replace Bruno. But I said that this morning to the team that we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing in that, and a lot of people need to step up.",
      "“It’s not just the creation. On every set-piece, he is the guy organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and realise we can’t rely on one player for everything.",
      "“Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad [Diallo] on set-pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "“This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw and all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.”",
      "Young midfielder Jack Fletcher, son of United hero Darren, came off the bench against Villa and is one of the options Amorim is considering.",
      "“We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing,” he said.",
      "“I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that’s why, when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "“I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players at this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust my players. If we are really focused on the game, we can win.”",
      "So, who replaces Fernandes in the United midfield?",
      "A Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte pairing seriously lacks creativity and, in the latter’s case, quality.",
      "Ugarte is short on confidence and has struggled every time he has taken to the pitch this season, with most of his appearances coming from the bench.",
      "He started against Villa last weekend and could start again if Amorim believes continuity is required to restore his form.",
      "But with Newcastle looking far less combative and physical in midfield, there is little need to pair the two South Americans.",
      "Fletcher is an option, but it will likely be Mount who starts alongside Casemiro, who returns from suspension to face the Magpies.",
      "Mount has impressed in recent weeks in a more advanced role, but he is perfectly capable of dropping deeper to perform a similar function to Fernandes.",
      "Mason Mount’s impact for Manchester United this season 🔴 pic.twitter.com/k9slPwA1FV",
      "He has the engine, tactical awareness and set-piece delivery to do as good a job as any in the middle of the park. It will be a big test, but one he is capable of passing.",
      "Mount could thrive in a starring role rather than a supporting one, and a top performance against Newcastle could put him firmly on England boss Thomas Tuchel’s radar, if he isn’t already.",
      "Mount dropping deeper, combined with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo being away at the Africa Cup of Nations, leaves question marks over Amorim’s front three.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is expected to start up front, with Matheus Cunha in behind him. The final attacking spot is up for grabs and will probably go to Joshua Zirkzee, with young striker Chido Obi the only other first-team option.",
      "It is either Casemiro and Ugarte in midfield with Mount, Cunha and Sesko ahead of them, or Casemiro and Mount in midfield with Zirkzee, Cunha and Sesko up front, or Martinez will start as a wildcard.",

      "And without wishing to pour any rain on Villa’s current parade, it does still bear mentioning that as the second half of the season pans out there is still the possibility/probability that Chelsea emerge as more significant rivals to Villa than the top two anyway in terms of Champions League qualification.",
      "Villa currently lead Enzo Maresca’s side by seven points and while sprinting to keep up with the top two isn’t doing Unai and the lads any harm right now it does feel like a day where, even for a team with 11 wins from their last 12 Premier League games, a draw would be absolutely fine and not in any way necessarily a momentum killer.",

      "Villa are obviously the best team in the country right now, but for the first time in a good while it’s looking like Man City might be second best. They’re certainly playing more convincing football than Arsenal right now, and have another chance to briefly leapfrog their main title rivals and put pressure on a potentially ticklish home game for Arsenal against a Brighton side who so often relish the chance to mess with the bigger boys.",

He isn’t the actual most irreplaceable player in the league, because that probably is still just Erling Haaland because of sheer weight of numbers, but his combination of vital importance and until now impeccable reliability does give this some real heft.",

      "Luckily, Liverpool have given them the perfect blueprint for how to be alarmingly bad but still beat Spurs.",
      "Frank is, clearly, in very deep trouble. The fallout from that vaguely absurd game against Liverpool in which Spurs played better with 10 men and then better still with nine means he has to try and engineer a result at Selhurst Park without both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero. Both let him down badly on Saturday in inconsistent seasons, and this doesn’t look like a moment in which Spurs or Frank can afford to have both their attack and defence weakened in this manner.",
      "Frank has already survived one encounter with his former club Brentford that had the possibility to end his Tottenham reign. But if he leaves Selhurst Park with the result we suspect, then the New Year trip to his old patch will carry old problems.",
      "There was mitigation and even encouragement from the performance even in defeat against Liverpool, but that won’t fly in the next couple of games. He’s got to find a result in one of these two games surely. And even that may be no more than delaying the now inevitable.",
      "",
      "Unlike the ultra-woke, Christmas-cancelling Premier League, the Football League is delivering a full sack of Boxing Day fixtures to enjoy with your turkey sandwiches, Rennies and hangover.",
      "Couple of tasty ones from the Championship promotion picture, too, with a couple of six-pointers among pairs of teams with their eyes on a play-off finish at worst.",
      "Stoke v Preston is one, with the Potters looking to arrest their recent slide while for Preston the recent issue has been too many draws in a six-match unbeaten run.",
      "The pick, though, looks to be Millwall v Ipswich, because third v sixth with third place up for grabs is always a particularly delicious dynamic for a Championship fixture at any time of the season.",
      "",
      "God bless Serie A for carrying on even though it’s Christmas, and also this season for delivering what looks certain to be the best title race across Europe’s big leagues. We still here have a top five separated by just four points and after a bad couple of weeks for Bologna and Como it does seem now to have crystallised into a scrap between five big guns.",
      "It’s currently all rather neat, with Inter top on 33 points and stacked up at one-point increments behind them come Milan, Napoli, Roma and Juventus.",
      "The Christmas weekend doesn’t pit any of the contenders in direct conflict, but Inter’s trip to Atalanta does look as good a choice as any.",
      "Essentially, absent a clear standout fixture for any of those title contenders, if you’re picking one game Inter are generally the safest bet on the entertainment front. They’ve conceded more goals than anyone else in the top eight bar Juventus (by a single goal) but with 34 goals in their 15 games thus far are 10 goals clear of anyone else."

      "Man Utd are one of two Premier League clubs to have made an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior ahead of the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side were perhaps the better team against Aston Villa on Sunday in their 2-1 defeat with the Red Devils missing Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "There were a number of youngsters on the Man Utd bench on Sunday and it now seems the Red Devils are likely to enter the January transfer market for new players.",
      "Man Utd had strong interest in signing Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth until widespread reports claimed that Man City is the Ghana international’s ‘preference’.",
      "With Amorim’s insistence that Man Utd don’t want to rely on short-term fixes, any deal for an attacker could have to wait until the summer, unless another good opportunity arises.",
      "READ: Top 10 post-Christmas title capitulations to frighten Arsenal (who have previous)",
      "And reports in Spain claim that Real Madrid have ‘received two offers of more than €100m’ for Vinicius Junior, one of which has come from the Red Devils.",
      "Real Madrid are struggling to get Vinicius Junior to sign a new deal as the Brazil international wants parity with top earner Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The report adds: ‘Faced with this situation, those at the Bernabeu have decided not to remain idle. Real Madrid are already listening to offers and, according to sources close to the club, two very serious proposals have arrived from the Premier League. Chelsea and Manchester United have put more than €100 million on the table to acquire Vinicius this summer, a figure that, at the very least, compels them to sit down and talk.",
      "‘At Real Madrid, there’s no urgency to sell, but there is concern about losing control of the narrative. Letting time pass without renewing Vinicius ‘ contract could become a strategic problem, especially if the player enters the final stretch of his contract without an agreement. Selling now, with strong offers and room to manoeuvre, is starting to look like a logical option.’",
      "There could be conversations about Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes being involved in the deal for Vinicius Junior in the summer with Spanish website Fichajes claiming Real Madrid see the Portugal international as a ‘realistic option’.",
      "It has been revealed that clubs from outside the Premier League can buy Fernandes for €60m as he has a release clause in his contract and ‘that amount fits within Real Madrid’s parameters for a strategic signing’.",
      "Fichajes adds: ‘Herein lies the main doubt. Bruno Fernandes is 31 years old, a factor that doesn’t quite convince Florentino Pérez. In recent years, the president has opted for young signings with potential and resale value.",
      "‘However, the club also recognizes the need for balance. Incorporating proven experience can be key to supporting an increasingly young squad in crucial moments.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano clarified Fernandes’ release clause earlier this week, he said: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",
      "Man United head coach Ruben Amorim says Bruno Fernandes is “impossible to replace” but he has to find a way against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",

      "Former Man Utd flops Juan Sebastian Veron, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Angel di Maria, Diego Forlan and others will go down as some of the worst deals in the clubs history – but Scholes reckons Bosnich is up there due to his “unprofessional” nature.",
      "When suggested that Veron was the Red Devils’ worst-ever signing, Scholes replied on The Overlap: “Veron was a great player, a talented player. Don’t really know why it didn’t work for him but what a footballer.",
      "“I go back to the goalkeepers, when you had to try and replace Peter Schmeichel, which is always going to be difficult.",

      "“I thought he was a good keeper at Villa, Mark. He came to us, he was so unprofessional. Honestly, it was ridiculous.",
      "“In shooting practice, you normally have like 15, 20 shots. After three shots, he’s knackered, ‘oh no, get someone else in’.",
      "“I never realised, he couldn’t kick a football. I’ve never seen anything like it. We played Everton away in first game of the season, and none of us picked up on it, he couldn’t reach the halfway line.",
      "“There was no wind, it was a perfect day. But when you look at his feet, size 14s, honestly he was just kicking the floor all the time, big flippers. Honestly, it was disappointing.”",
      "In Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography in 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson also branded Bosnich – who came through the youth ranks at Man Utd – “a terrible professional”.",
      "On Bosnich, who played 38 times in two spells for Man Utd, Ferguson said: “Mark Bosnich was, in my opinion, a terrible professional, which we should have known.",
      "“The Bosnich buy stemmed from Peter Schmeichel announcing in the autumn of his final season that he would be retiring, which caught us on the hop. We jumped into decisions.",
      "“We met Bosnich in January, despite reports filtering through to us about his conduct off the pitch. I sent someone down to watch him in training. He was doing nothing in the sessions that convinced me he was the right man for Manchester United.",
      "“I changed tack and went for Edwin van der Sar instead, spoke to his agent and then to Martin Edwards, who told me, ‘Alex, I’m sorry, I’ve shaken hands with Bosnich.’ That was a blow. Martin had shaken Mark’s hand and would not go back on his word, which I respect. But it was a bad piece of business.”",
      "When asked about Ferguson’s comments about him, the former Man Utd goalkeeper told FourFourTwo: “It wasn’t unfair – it was just a lie.",
      "“He’s always said that he doesn’t bear any grudges, but obviously he does. But he can say that because he knows what happened afterwards, with the drugs and so on – he’s got good evidence to back himself up. At that time, though, it was a lie.",
      "“Alex Ferguson signed me twice. I wouldn’t be talking to you now about my career unless he had taken a chance on me originally. Yes, we had a falling out, but these things happen. He was a great manager to play under.”",

      "As a Christmas treat we always like to revisit our pre-season predictions to get a sneak peek at who is on the way to looking utterly clueless.",
      "The full pre-season predictions are here if you want to have a proper laugh, or we will pick out the highlights…",
      "Starting – as is traditional – with the Premier League champions, this was bold from the boss (me): ‘Not Arsenal. Not having that.’ So guess who is very, very invested in the Gunners f***ing this up as they traditionally do from being top at Christmas.",
      "Dave Tickner was the only F365-er who actually tipped Arsenal, while Matt Stead and Ian Watson also plumped for Manchester City. The rest are already out of the race by tipping Liverpool and Chelsea; this was back in the days when we were dreaming of a four-horse title race.",
      "The top four, which nobody ever gets right? Every single one of us went for a combination of last season’s top four, with Lewis Oldham adding to his Liverpool title prediction with this beauty: ‘Chelsea. Arsenal. Manchester City. Not sold on City as title challengers yet. Arsenal third in the battle for first as real deal Chelsea (26/27 will be their year) to edge out their rivals to second and potentially seal Arteta sack.’",
      "Nobody saw Aston Villa coming.",
      "Let’s get relegation out of the way. Some of us absolutely f***ed it on Sunderland but Joe Williams, Jason Soutar and Lewis Oldham saw the Black Cats surprise coming. There were far too many Brentford shouts, but John Nicholson, Williams and Soutar nailed it on Wolves. Williams may yet still entirely nail it with Wolves, Burnley and Leeds, but that’s expecting a lot of West Ham.",
      "The pleasant surprise of the season? There was a weird volume of excitement about Everton, but points go again to Williams for his Sunderland shout. It looked ridiculous at the time. What looks ridiculous now is Stead: ‘It has been an absolute delight to laugh at them all summer but Newcastle will rise from the cuck chair and excel on the pitch, if not the boardroom, with another top-five finish.’",
      "Also ridiculous was Watson dreaming that Manchester United would sign a ‘midfielder with legs’. He is still waiting.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? ‘This is dull but Erling Haaland. I can’t see Mo Salah coming even vaguely close,’ said Winterburn (me, this is weird). Taking that all day.",
      "We’re still not sure if Johnny was being serious with his Liam Delap call, while Watson bought into the Viktor Gyokeres hype. But once again, we return to Stead: ‘Alexander Isak stays, quickly realises it might not be the best idea to entirely starve oneself of competitive football in a World Cup year and has his Luis Suarez season before getting that move.’",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? There were big shouts for Gyokeres and Joao Pedro, while Will Ford had an inkling for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall at Everton. I did say we were oddly excited about Everton. What’s the actual answer so far? Probably Granit Xhaka or Robin Roefs.",
      "As for the massive flop…I was likely wrong on Hugo Ekitike, but Stead was right on the assorted Chelsea rejects. Williams might have nailed it again as he described Benjamin Sesko as ‘wildly overpriced’ while Tickner might be oddly prescient in suggesting that Gyokeres, Sesko and Ekitike would all struggle to reach double figures.",
      "There were calls for Bryan Mbeumo, Rayan Cherki and Noni Madueke that could be a little wide of the mark, but Ford might have smashed it with Gyokeres. The predictions were written before the Alexander Isak signing so Floppy McFlopface did not get a mention.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? ‘Rayan Cherki feels like a steal at £34m…or a third of a Grealish,’ might be my finest hour. Stead’s Jhon Arias call might not be his, while the least said the better about mentions of Angus Gunn and Kyle Walker-Peters.",
      "PFA Player of the Year will not be Rodri, Cole Palmer or Florian Wirtz. It might be Declan Rice, though. The Spurs fan among us what the only true believer in Arsenal.",
      "The first Premier League manager to be sacked was Nuno Espirito Santo. Once again, we give you Tickner. He confidently wrote: ‘Mr Marinakis is on one right now, positively aglow with main character energy, and the off-field shenanigans cannot mask that Forest ended last season in pretty ropey fashion. And have been honking in pre-season. They only managed eight points from their final nine Premier League games last season – and it wasn’t that tough a run-in either. Start this season anything like the way they ended the last with Marinakis in his current mood to move fast and break things, and Nuno is very quickly in very big trouble.’ No notes.",
      "We always end with ‘in five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season’.",
      "I stand by mine: ‘A proper f***ing title race.’"

      "“We have to say congrats to Casemiro. In this video let’s focus on Casemiro, because he’s been able to change his situation at Manchester United.",
      "“If you think about Casemiro one year ago or a bit more, there was a feeling like, okay, we have to find a solution. We have to part ways. The salary is too high. The player is not performing. He was not an important or crucial player for United.",
      "“But Casemiro has always been a legend of the game. He is the man who made the history of Real Madrid, who made history with the Brazilian national team. So a fantastic midfielder.",
      "“He’s been able to change the situation, to become a starter for Ruben Amorim, a crucial player on and off the pitch, an absolute leader, a wonderful version of Casemiro, this final one he is showing with Manchester United.",
      "“So now the desire is from Man United, obviously, to continue with Casemiro, but in different conditions.",
      "“So the salary he has right now is a salary that Manchester United don’t want to pay in the future, not because of Casemiro or Maguire, but because they want to change the salary structure.”",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why he substituted Casemiro over other players during their 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "With Viktor Gyokeres continuing to struggle for Arsenal, he is among a sextet of Big Six starters doomed for a prolonged snub and/or exit in 2026…",
      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping their cards close to their chest regarding Casemiro and Harry Maguire, which they are right to do…",
      "Man Utd have made a record-breaking ‘offer’ to sign Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘close’ to completing a January transfer as they look to sign a new centre-midfielder."

      "Arsenal sit top of the table at Christmas for the fifth time in the Premier League era; they have never won the title from this position!",
      "Only Liverpool have been top of the Premier League at Christmas more times and failed to get over the line.",
      "They join Manchester United (twice), Newcastle (twice), Norwich, Aston Villa and Leeds United in knowing the pain of getting over-excited over the turkey only to end the season empty handed, and some of those collapses have been rather spectacular.",
      "Here’s 10 of the worst from the past 33 years, including a handful of particularly notable ones from the lower leagues.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United – 2003/04 (Premier League)\nUnited at least had the excuse of going up against Arsenal’s Invincibles, but the depth of United’s post-Christmas drop-off was surprising for a Sir Alex Ferguson side nonetheless.",
      "They had lost just three times before Christmas, with a goalless draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford the only time they had shared the spoils, putting them a point ahead of Arsenal and Chelsea on Christmas Day.",
      "But United dropped points more often than they won them from there: their post-Christmas record was W10, D5, L6, with a 4-1 defeat to away to struggling Manchester City particularly painful, especially as it left Fergie’s side with just two wins in eight games. United ended up finishing third, 15 points adrift of unbeaten Arsenal.",
      "",
      "9) Norwich City – 1992/93 (Premier League)\nTitle-less Norwich had also been top on Christmas Day 1988, only to end up finishing third behind Arsenal and Liverpool. Well, this time it was going to be different! Except, erm, no, it wasn’t.",
      "The Canaries learned nothing from the warning they had provided themselves on their previous trip to the coal mine, and in fact their collapse began just before Christmas: they didn’t win any of their six games between their loss at Old Trafford on 12th December and their 1-1 draw at home to Coventry on 16th January.",
      "Mike Walker’s side remained in indifferent mid-table form for the rest of the campaign, bizarrely alternating between impressive victories and crushing high-scoring defeats. Norwich ended up finishing 12 points behind Manchester United in third – and, very weirdly, with a negative goal difference to boot.",
      "",
      "8) Leeds United – 1999/00 (Premier League)\nLeeds were two points clear at top for the last Christmas of the 20th century (yeah, yeah, shut up, ‘the millennium was actually 2001′ pedants, nobody likes you) partly because they had a game in hand over Manchester United, but again , it’s the sheer depths they sank to from there that makes it notable.",
      "After shrugging off early-season defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool, David O’Leary’s Leeds had been almost unstoppable. Only Everton and Wimbledon succeeded in getting anything off them in an impressive run up to and including Boxing Day, with Michael Bridges and Harry Kewell particular stars.",
      "But things immediately nosedived after that: Leeds lost four of their next six, including six-pointers against fellow title hopefuls Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Three straight wins in March briefly revived Leeds’ hopes of pushing Ferguson’s men all the way – they had just four points to make up in their last nine games – but they promptly lost four in a row to put themselves dead in the water and ended up third, some 22 points off the pace.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds United – 2018/19 (Championship)\nAnd what a lovely way to segue to the EFL section of our list. It was Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds this time, and again they were one point clear at the top of the second tier on Christmas Day with exactly half the season’s games played. More importantly for their automatic promotion prospects, they were six ahead of third-placed West Brom.",
      "We’re going to resist the temptation to put their decline down to the infamous spygate incident, not least because Leeds actually lost both their last game of 2018 at home to bottom-half Hull and their New Year’s Day fixture away to Nottingham Forest. Yet despite looking far more fragile and, frankly, knackered than in the first half of the season, Leeds remained in the top two. With just four games to go Bielsa’s side were still in second place, three points clear of third-placed Sheffield United.",
      "Their fixture list was extremely inviting, too: encounters against 21st-placed Wigan, 15th-placed Brentford, fifth-placed Aston Villa, and rock-bottom Ipswich. They got a decent point against Villa, but contrived to lose the other three. That meant Leeds finished six points away from automatic promotion; narrative dictated they must then lose to Derby in the play-off semi finals.",
      "",
      "6) Portsmouth – 2020/21 (League One)\nThat season behind closed doors is one we’d all collective like to forget, but nobody more so than Portsmouth. They led an extremely tight third-tier table on Christmas Day on goal difference and having played a game more than second-placed Lincoln City, but their credentials were supported by Pompey having the best record in the division in both the goals for and goals against columns.",
      "But an abysmal run that started with a four-goal defeat at home to Hull in late January saw Portsmouth plummet to 10th by March, costing manager Kenny Jackett his job.",
      "Hopes of a reviving the season just enough to claim a play-off spot were briefly awakened as new appointment Danny Cowley led Pompey to four wins right off the bat, but they won just two more of their remaining eight games and ended up in eighth place, two points shy of the top six.",
      "",
      "5) Huddersfield Town – 1999/00 (Championship, as it wasn’t called then)\nEnglish football’s first three-in-a-row champions had spent 27 years outside the top flight by the time they sat top of the tree for Christmas 1999, thanks in no small part to Marcus Stewart’s superb form in front of goal.",
      "Steve Bruce’s Terriers won just one game in January and February, however, and compounded their slide to fifth place by unexpectedly selling Stewart to fourth-placed Ipswich Town on 1st February.",
      "Stewart would, naturally, score the winner against Huddersfield less than two weeks later, then help fire the Tractor Boys to promotion via the play-offs; Huddersfield weren’t even involved, having finished the season in eighth place. Stewart scored 19 Premier League goals the following season as Ipswich finished a brilliant fifth; Huddersfield were meanwhile relegated to the third tier. So that worked out well.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool – 1996/97 (Premier League)\nAlright then, back to the Premier League from here, we reckon. And again we return to the 1990s, when a lot of the time you could win titles with a points tally in the 70s. Liverpool were well on course for that by Christmas 1996, when the Spice Girls were top of the charts with 2 Become 1 and the Spice Boys were top of the Premier League. Unfortunately for them, 1 Became 4.",
      "It wasn’t any one extended run of especially awful form that did for them – they never went more than two games without a win – but more a general inability to string together a convincing run of victories: they only did so once in the second half the season, in fact, winning three in a row in January-February.",
      "A series of David James blunders was particularly costly for Roy Evans’ side, whose title hopes were effectively killed off by a 3-1 defeat at home to eventual champions Manchester United with just three games left to play. Newcastle and Arsenal snuck in ahead of the Reds on goal difference on the final day, to boot, leaving Liverpool to finish fourth in a two-horse race.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa – 1998/99 (Premier League)\nIt’s always remarkable to look back on Manchester United’s treble-winning season and remember just how easily they could have ended up completely empty-handed. Case in point: it was John Gregory’s Aston Villa, not United, who sat top of the table on Christmas Day that season.",
      "It didn’t last long: Villa were displaced by a defeat away to Blackburn Rovers on Boxing Day, returned very briefly by beating Sheffield Wednesday, then never reclaimed top spot as they embarked on a genuinely miserable second half of the season as Dion Dublin and Julian Joachim’s brilliant goalscoring form dried up.",
      "Villa took just 12 points from their final 16 games of the season, with their only three wins in that run all coming in a vain and far-belated burst of late-season form. They were already down to sixth by that point, and three straight losses to finish the season ensured that was where they finished.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – 2013/14 (Premier League)\nAh, god, do we really need to recap this one? It takes such a high position not because Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool were miles ahead at Christmas, because they weren’t: they were only top on goal difference and just two points ahead of fifth-placed Everton.",
      "Nor is it because Liverpool were notably awful in the second half of the campaign: they were the joint-second best team in the division from Boxing Day onwards, too, dropping just four points between between game 20 on New Year’s Day and game 35 in mid-April.",
      "But come on. You can’t make any list of title capitulations without including Liverpool 2013/14. This does not slip (which he did). Another Istanbul (which they were on the receiving end of from Crystal Palace). Comedy gold.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United – 1995/96 (Premier League)\nA brilliant failure that may never be topped. Ten points. Ten bloody points clear, Newcastle were. Ten points at Christmas. They’d been top of the table since beating Coventry 3-0 on the opening day and would stay there until close to the end of March. In the bag.",
      "Except that having been dodgy as owt going into Christmas, a Manchester United inspired by Eric Cantona’s return from his fan-kicky suspension were virtually flawless after opening their stockings (leave it), winning all but four of their games – starting with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle themselves.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, were very, very flawed, with Faustino Asprilla’s mid-season arrival bringing yet more flair to an already attacking side but leading Kevin Keegan to disastrously change shape to fit him in, while new midfield arrival David Batty failed to help matters.",
      "That famous 4-3 defeat at Anfield in early April was Newcastle’s fourth defeat in six games, and the upturn in their form that followed was too late: Manchester United had overtaken them, and made sure the title was sealed on points rather than goal difference by winning their final two games while Newcastle were only able to draw theirs."

      "“Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it’s going to be tough. But with Sesko coming back, Cunha could drop back into where Mbeumo was playing.",
      "“Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don’t know how we’re going to do it, whether we are going to change shape. I’m not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed.",
      "“And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don’t go through the group stage, and we don’t miss them for too long.",
      "“The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that’s a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they’re playing regularly.",
      "“And now we’re starting to see the Mason Mount that we saw at Chelsea for a number of years. He’s a good, clever player.",

      "Manchester United often don’t even bother with the January transfer window, perhaps scarred by the memory of their worst signing of the post-Ferguson era. But it also prompted their very best…",
      "United are reported to be in the market for January recruits, though they appear to have missed out on Antoine Semenyo.",
      "If they sign another forward before midfielder, frankly, the club should be folded. But reports suggest they could also be in the market for Ruben Neves. Which, unless he leaves his legs in Saudi, seems like a good idea.",
      "As did most of these January signings. Even this fella at no.10…",
      "",
      "Rated on these pages as the worst of all the post-Fergie signings, which is really quite an achievement when you consider your Di Marias, your Sanchos, your Pogbas. But Sanchez admitted he wanted to quit United and return to Arsenal after only his first training session. Sadly for him and United, there was no return policy on the £35million swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan join the Gunners.",
      "Then the highest-paid player ever in the Premier League, Sanchez stuck it out for 32 league appearances, scoring three goals while barely hiding his contempt for his surroundings.",
      "In fairness to United, no one saw it going this badly wrong when he was tinkling the ivories for his unveiling video. In Sanchez, they had signed one of the Premier League’s best players. But, even by United standards, the immediate slump in the Chilean’s output once he walked through the Old Trafford door was damning on all concerned. In the end, they had to pay him millions just to f*** off, which was far better value than the millions they paid him to play.",
      "",
      "At Barcelona, Valdes won everything in one of the greatest teams of all time. So it was quite striking to see him as barely a bit-part at United after he signed for 18 months as a freebie for Louis van Gaal in January 2015.",
      "Valdes played two games for United, serving as understudy to compatriot David De Gea before p*ssing off Van Gaal to the extent he wasn’t allowed to train even with the youth team or allowed a locker for his Rolex while he worked out alone with an academy goalkeeping coach.",
      "",
      "Arriving on loan from Palace in January 2023, ex-England stopper Butland was just one of a few odd goalkeeper signings made by United, replacing another in Martin Dubravka. At least Dubravka got his gloves dirty twice. Butland never made it off the bench for the club he supported as a boy, even if he took an FA Cup runners-up medal back to Palace with him.",
      "",
      "The Netherlands international is widely derided on the basis that he failed to score a Premier League goal in his half-season at Old Trafford. Which isn’t a good look for a centre-forward.",
      "But after a loan switch from Burnley, with the Clarets splitting £3million with Besiktas, Weghorst endeared himself to the United faithful just by running around a bit and showing an appetite to be there. That’s how low the bar was for a fanbase fed up of watching Anthony Martial’s mard-arse saunter around Old Trafford.",
      "He scored two cup goals, won the Carabao Cup and generally seemed to relish his big opportunity. But, enthusiastic though he was, he was never likely to be the top-class striker Erik ten Hag needed.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag had to hurriedly spin through his Rolodex during the final days of the January 2023 transfer window as soon as it emerged that Christian Eriksen would be out for three months after bumping into Andy Carroll in a bad mood.",
      "As the first Austrian to play for United, Sabitzer scored three goals in 18 appearances and had a hand in the Carabao Cup triumph by coming off the bench in the final against Newcastle. When his loan was up, everyone concerned seemed pretty non-plussed about the prospect of making it a longer-term arrangement. He did okay but his impact was negligible.",
      "In the end, Sabitzer returned to Bayern Munich before being sold to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "",
      "United’s move for Ighalo in January 2020 sparked a new genre of transfer: an Ighalo-type move, one defined as late, desperate and short-term. See: Weghorst.",
      "In that sense, Ighalo served his purpose. Arriving from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020, he bagged five goals in 19 appearances in the Covid season to earn a six-month extension before heading off to Al Shabab to complete the lucrative CSL-Pro League double bubble.",
      "MORE FROM F365: Liverpool, Tottenham and Newcastle among top 10 storylines we weren’t expecting in 2025",
      "The jury is still out on Dorgu but a year on from his arrival from Lecce, a verdict is surely imminent. Frankly, though, it doesn’t look encouraging. And the slim possibility that he might yet come good means he ranks higher than his performances so far merit.",
      "The Denmark international is still only 21 with less senior experience than many peers of a similar age so it was unfair to expect him to hit the ground running. But it is hard to identify many redeeming features in the left wing-back. He’s quick, sure. But can you recall him giving many opposition full-backs a hard time? There is certainly little encouragement to be found in a record of no goals and three assists in 37 appearances. Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing but wing-backs on both sides are among the areas United are still considered weakest.",
      "",
      "The spectacle of club-record signing Mata being choppered into Carrington to join United in January 2014 summed up the post-Fergie United. Or rather the post-David Gill United. The Woodward United.",
      "Not that any of that was Mata’s fault. And for much of his career at United, the former Spain playmaker was a pleasure to watch. Never more than in March 2015 at Juanfield. And the fact he’s a good egg did him no harm, even if he rarely dragged United to new heights as one might expect of a creative record signing.",
      "Mata spent seven and a half years at Old Trafford, scoring 51 goals in 285 appearances, winning four trophies. Never the big ones, but United haven’t been in a position to be sniffy about silverware.",
      "The Diallo deal was arranged in October 2020 to be completed the following January. And for a while, it looked like more money down the drain when the winger struggled to make a first-team breakthrough. A loan move to Sunderland went much better than an earlier stint at Rangers and eventually, three years after he joined, Amad began to get some regular minutes in the second half of the 2023/24 season under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ten Hag was binned, Amad was expected to be one of the players to profit from Amorim’s appointment and the sudden need for wing-backs. Indeed, were it not for an ankle injury last season, he would be in the top three players with most minutes under Amorim. Amad can play as wing-back or as one of the wide forwards. He probably prefers the latter but is needed more as the former.",
      "",
      "Quite simply the best signing of the post-Fergie era, be it the summer or winter window.",
      "Fernandes has been the single consistent bright spot on a rather bleak landscape since he arrived from Sporting Lisbon pre-Covid in 2020. Immediately dismiss the opinion of anyone who pushes the claim that Fernandes has been ‘a problem’, or indeed anything but the best, most creative signing of the last dozen years. Imagine how bad United would have been without him.",
      "Not a single bit of that Manchester United win over Newcastle made any sense, especially the in-game management of Ruben Amorim. Yet he absolutely nailed it.",
      "It’s not another symbol of Broken Britain but it is sad that there will be only one Premier League game on Boxing Day.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 07:29, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",

      "Amorim's tactical change to a 4-2-3-1 formation with Dorgu playing on the right wing appeared to confuse Newcastle early on, with Casemiro and Benjamin Sesko going close. And though Eddie Howe did adjust, Dorgu's wonderful volley beat Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The 21-year-old Denmark international has had his struggles since arriving from Lecce last winter but he impressed here even beyond his spectacular goal, although it was Matheus Cunha with his driving runs from deep who lit up the first half at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Heaven (8), Martinez (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (7), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (7), Dorgu (8), Mount (6), Cunha (8), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Fletcher (6), Yoro (6), Zirkzee (5), Fredricson (n/a), Malacia (n/a).\n\n\nNewcastle: Ramsdale (5), Miley (6), Schar (6), Thiaw (6), Hall (7), Guimaraes (7), Tonali (6), Ramsey (5), Murphy (6), Gordon (6), Woltemade (6). \n\n\nSubs: Joelinton (6), Wissa (6), Barnes (6), Willock (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Ayden Heaven.",
      "Although Sesko did hit the crossbar on the counter-attack, Howe's side certainly stepped up the pressure in the second half with Lewis Hall striking the underside of the bar himself. Amorim had Dorgu and Diogo Dalot as his wingers in a 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Dalot even came close to doubling the lead but it was Newcastle pushing - Lisandro Martinez, on his return to the starting line-up, surviving a VAR call for a penalty against him. They lacked the cutting edge to break down a resolute defensive effort.",
      "Manchester United finished this game with a back four of Leny Yoro, Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven and Tyrell Malacia - a trio of youngsters and a left-back making his first appearance of the season. Martinez had earlier shone on his first start.",
      "The midfield two were Jack Fletcher and Manuel Ugarte, the former having come on for the injured Mason Mount at half-time. On the wings were Dalot and Dorgu. Joshua Zirkzee was up front. That Amorim was able to fashion this into a rearguard action that kept out Newcastle was a minor Christmas miracle.",
      "Manchester United won a Premier League game without Bruno Fernandes for the first time since Ralf Rangnick was in charge.",
      "On the night that Amorim changed his formation, something he had once said he could never do, he comes out of it strengthened. By the victory, of course. But, in a curious way, the manner of it too. It was not fluent but resolute. They are battling to improve.",
      "\"We had to suffer altogether in the stadium. It was really difficult for us. We had a good first half and then the second half we just defend and tried to do something with Cunha. We had our opportunities in transitions.",
      "\"It was a good win, but I had so many games here when we played well and didn't get the three points. Today it was the opposite.\"",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet. There has to be pride in your defending.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in.",
      "\"They have to kick on now. Getting a win under their belts will give them huge belief and confidence going forward.\"",
      "\"Second half a lot better than the first but we didn't do enough. It was not for a lack of effort. Felt if we scored we could have gone on to win the game.\"",
      "Asked if he had been caught out by the change of formation by Amorim, Howe replied: \"Caught out? I actually thought we started the game really well for 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "\"But we didn't respond well to the goal. I was disappointed at half time with our inability to grab control of the game because I thought it was there for us to take.",
      "\"I don't think it was a tactical issue for us. I don't think we looked as physically good as we did against Chelsea when we were physically outstanding.",
      "\"I don't think there was a tactical problem for us at any stage of the game. We are disappointed with the way we defended the goal. Long throws were something we prepared for.",
      "\"We are disappointed with our actions in terms of trying to score because we created the chances, put a lot of crosses in their box. The chances were there.",
      "\"If we score that equalising goal then that momentum is there with us.\"",

      "To overcome so many hurdles is not easy, but Mount puts his resilience down to his early years of chasing his dream to become a professional footballer.",
      "\"I think in my younger years, I didn't have loads of downs. I was very lucky to play in very good teams where we won a lot.",

      "With key attacking absences likely to affect Manchester United's output, United will be looking towards Matheus Cunha to provide the creative and shooting threat.",
      "Repeatable patterns in betting are something to respect and Cunha's shooting profile is exactly that. No player since the start of last season has hit the target more often from outside the box than Cunha (31), which tells you this isn't variance, it's design. Even more encouraging, four of those outside-the-box shots on target have come in his last two games, highlighting current confidence and freedom in his role.",
      "Away from home, Eddie Howe's side concede 1.21 shots from outside the box per game across their last 30 away league matches, the third-most of any Premier League team. That's a defensive concession profile that invites exactly the type of effort Cunha specialises in.",
      "At Evens with Sky Bet for one or more Cunha shots on target from outside the box, you're not asking for a goal, just a clean connection that troubles the goalkeeper from outside the area.",
      "Manchester City are becoming the punters' pals again such has been their reliability. It's seven wins on the spin for Pep Guardiola's boys who have the scent of Arsenal in their nostrils.",
      "Guardiola is doing things differently too. Once famed for his rotation, over the last eight gameweeks, he has used fewer players (12) in his starting XI than any other Premier League manager. This is providing some great trends to develop across the props markets for us to follow, including the foul-drawing ability of Mathues Nunes for City. He's lured in nine fouls from the opposition in his last five starts and tops the charts for being City's most fouled player this season. He's 6/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls again.",
      "Taking the opposition shots lines against Arsenal at The Emirates isn't usually a betting theory to explore - but under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton are not a normal team when visiting the elite and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shots bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 11 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under this manager's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 15.8 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.78 expected goals per game. That is an outrageous output. That is a title-contender chance creation from a side that isn't sniffing anywhere near a title challenge.",
      "The markets are behind on this curve. We can jump on Brighton to register 10 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "This is a game where it's hard to get away from the numbers. Let's hope they don't lie.",
      "Across Brentford's last 11 league games at the Gtech, we're seeing a hefty 3.9 goals per match, which immediately tells you two things: they're playing front-foot football and they're far from watertight at the back.",
      "Now add Bournemouth into the equation and the noise only gets louder. Their away games are averaging a remarkable 4.5 goals per match, which is elite-level volatility. Andoni Iraola has fully committed to an aggressive press on the road, and while it creates chances at one end, it leaves them horribly exposed at the other.",
      "If you combine both teams to score and over 2.5 goals you conjure up a 4/5 shot to attack with Sky Bet.",
      "This is the part of the season where experience quietly tilts the balance. Fixtures come thick and fast, preparation time is limited and matches often hinge on game management rather than tactical perfection.",
      "That's where David Moyes stands out.",
      "Across 58 Premier League matches managed between December 23 and January 8, his teams have posted a 45 per cent win ratio, which is an impressive return during one of the most demanding stretches of the calendar. It points to a manager who understands how to simplify the game when legs are tired and focus shifts from style to substance.",
      "In a game likely decided by fine margins, backing experience, particularly on the touchline, feels like the sensible angle with Evens on offer for an away win.",
      "When you're playing at Anfield, long spells without the ball are inevitable. And when a team spends most of the game chasing shadows, the foul count usually starts to climb.",
      "That's the angle that makes Wolves interesting here in a very difficult betting heat. Since Rob Edwards took charge, they've been averaging 16.8 fouls per 90 minutes - the most of any team in the Premier League. Teams that expect to suffer tend to foul more, not out of malice, but frustration. And there is plenty of that in the Wolves camp.",
      "Wolves to make the most fouls in each half at 13/8 with Sky Bet is worth a look.",
      "Since Nuno Espírito Santo took charge at West Ham, their matches have taken on a very clear profile. We're seeing an average of exactly three goals per game, but the more telling metric is the expected goals figure, which sits even higher at 3.3 per match.",
      "That tells you these games aren't being inflated by freak finishes or red cards, the chances are genuinely flowing at both ends.",
      "Nuno's West Ham are far more direct and very transition-heavy. They attack quickly, commit bodies forward and are happy to take risks - something the home fans will be demanding in this important and winnable home fixture. The Hammers aren't trustworthy enough to back outright at 8/5 with Sky Bet but the over 2.5 goals and both teams to score combo at Evens is a price with possibilities.",
      "Aston Villa's underlying numbers suggest a bit of turbulence ahead. But context matters and this trip to Chelsea is one of those spots where Villa remain very hard to ignore despite the data warnings with 3/1 with Sky Bet on offer to make it 11 wins in a row.",
      "Chelsea still struggle to control games for long periods, especially against teams willing to attack space quickly. That's where Morgan Rogers comes to the party. Villa's main man doesn't need volume, he needs moments - and Chelsea provide plenty of those.",
      "A Villa win with Rogers on the scoresheet isn't too much to ask. It's landed in three of his last seven starts, meaning the 8/1 with Sky Bet rates as a value play.",
      "There are certain grounds you simply can't ignore. The Stadium of Light has become a place where structure, energy and belief do the heavy lifting, and those qualities tend to travel very well through a season. It's now eight Premier League home games unbeaten, with five wins and three draws and that consistency tells you plenty about what kind of team they are.",
      "With key players away at AFCON, there's a temptation to downgrade Sunderland. But this is a side built on collective understanding and tactical clarity. Remove a few pieces and the structure still holds - as shown in their excellent performance at Brighton.",
      "Leeds, meanwhile, have struggled badly on the road. Six defeats in eight away games paints a picture of a team that hasn't yet found a way to control matches outside familiar surroundings.",
      "The market is disrespecting the influence of the Stadium of Light resulting in us being able to back Sunderland on the draw no bet at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Crystal Palace's defence is creaking. It's now 10 goals conceded in their last four games across all competitions. Before that, over the previous 12 matches they'd only shipped eight goals in total. The squad has been stretched beyond its limits and results are now suffering as such.",
      "Spurs have had an eight-day break since their last game - their longest gap between games this season. Thomas Frank is a process-focused, hands-on coach that needs training time to implement his ideas - something he's not had the luxury of this season. And although Frank's team have been one of the most impotent teams in the Premier League this season from an attacking perspective, there is quality in that forward line to feast on a Palace defensive process that is offering up more gifts than usual. The away win at 11/5 with Sky Bet is a touch generous.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Kobbie Mainoo is the future of Manchester United despite the speculation surrounding the midfielder's future.",
      "Amorim has not started Mainoo in a single Premier League game this season, with his last league start coming in May during a 2-0 defeat to West Ham.",
      "An injury to Bruno Fernandes, who Amorim described as Mainoo's competition, may give the 20-year-old an opportunity once he recovers from a calf injury, and his head coach has insisted that he sees the player's future being at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He played in different positions - we talked about the position of Casemiro, he can do that. If you play with a three, he can play like we did in the last game with the position of Mason Mount, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Mainoo's lack of game time under Amorim has prompted interest from clubs across the Premier League and in Europe, with both loan and permanent exits being touted for the England international.",
      "However, with Fernandes' injury and players away for the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim admits that it is unlikely that Mainoo will be allowed to leave in January.",
      "\"If we are not getting someone, it’s hard to [let Mainoo leave]. We are shorter,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter with something that can happen here.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in everybody’s head, we need to win every game, there are no excuses. So it’s going to be hard to leave the club if we don’t get a substitution.\"",
      "\"A few days before [his injury], we were talking about Kobbie doesn’t have the minutes he deserves or needs. Then there’s an opportunity, and Kobbie is not there.",
      "\"Sometimes, it is bad luck and during this year, we have some moments with a bit of bad luck.\"",
      "With numbers thin on the ground, United may be forced to be active in the January transfer market, with the club among a number of suitors interested in Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "If any signing is to happen, it is not going to be done in a panic as Amorim has insisted the club will stick to their plans with regards to any potential business.",
      "\"We are struggling in this moment but the club, we have a plan and we are going to stick with it,\" he insisted.",
      "\"If we have the opportunity to bring a player who we think is going to be the future of the club, he's going to come.",
      "\"When I look at the team, when we have the full squad, I need to take more quality from that group. If we can bring someone good, if not, then we will spend money in the summer.\"",

Even more encouraging, four of those outside-the-box shots on target have come in his last two games, highlighting current confidence and freedom in his role.",
      "Away from home, Eddie Howe's side concede 1.21 shots from outside the box per game across their last 30 away league matches, the third-most of any Premier League team. That's a defensive concession profile that invites exactly the type of effort Cunha specialises in.",

      "Amorim is hoping Fernandes' absence will give other players the chance to step up and lead the team, as well as take up his position in midfield.",
      "\"It's impossible to replace Bruno,\" the head coach said in his pre-match press conference. \"But I said that this morning to the team, we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, and a lot of people need to step up.",
      "\"It's not just the creation. On every set-piece, he is the guy organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and realise we can't rely on one player for everything.",
      "\"Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad in set pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "\"This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw, all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "On who might come in for Fernandes in Man Utd's midfield, Amorim added: \"We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing.",
      "\"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job [against Aston Villa] and that's why when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "\"I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players in this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust in my players. If we are really focused in the game, we can win.\"",

      "The United captain, who could have joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for £100m, said he was \"hurt\" and \"sad\" about how the situation had been handled in an interview with Portuguese TV station Canal 11.",

      "\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing, but to take all the value of the squad that I had last year, maybe it was not the right choices all the time. I watched the games from last season to understand different things.",
      "\"I'm a different manager today. I will do maybe 75 per cent of the things different, but the key things, the red lines would be the same. I think I'm a better manager now.\"",
