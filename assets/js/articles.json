      "Manchester United are looking to battle with Newcastle as they both eye RB Leipzig frontman Benjamin Sesko with the Magpies already seeing an offer for the Slovenian rejected.",
      "The Red Devils have now tabled an offer and do have the finances to pursue Sesko without selling any of their current players. Already they've spent more than £120million to land Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha but now want a No 9 to lead their line.",
      "Ruben Amorim is under pressure to make a far greater impact than he did last season but new recruits have been limited so far this summer. The United boss will hope his extended time on the training ground will aid his philosophy and game plan at Old Trafford.",
      "United still need to try and get a number of players off their books with time running out ahead of their Premier League opener in less than a fortnight. Here's the latest coming out of Manchester.",
      "United are desperate to sign a new striker this summer and have Nicolas Jackson among their two back-up options if they fail to land Sesko from Leipzig with Newcastle also pushing to land the Slovenian.",
      "The Chelsea forward is on their shortlist with the Athletic reporting that the Blues are be open to selling Jackson this summer after signing Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, but only if they receive an acceptable proposal.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe, meanwhile, are reporting that PSG's Randal Kolo Muani is another option United are considering. Juventus were the frontrunners to land Kolo Muani, but it is claimed that deal has now stalled, which could allow those in Manchester to swoop back in.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen are keen on a move for United's Rasmus Hojlund as Erik ten Hag considers signing the Dane for the second time in two years. It was during his second summer that the Dutchman spent more than £70m to land the striker from Atalanta.",
      "Hojlund has struggled for goals and is linked with a move away with the Bundesliga now a live option. Leverkusen, who have received plenty of cash this summer, could face competition from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus according to Caught Offside.",
      "Amorim recently admitted he could offer no assurances that Hojlund would remain at Old Trafford beyond this summer's window, even though the player himself is keen to remain and prove that he is capable of cutting in it Manchester.",
      "Omar Berrada has insisted major figures at the club are working hard to strengthen Amorim's squad this summer. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the United CEO said: \"We have to do a lot of multi-tasking.",
      "\"We have a team back home led by (director of football) Jason (Wilcox), the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it. What we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.\"",

      "Barcelona face a race against time to sell players to make room for Marcus Rashford in their squad, it has been claimed. The Catalan club face a familiar problem as they aim to register the England international, who completed a loan move from Manchester United in July.",
      "Last summer, Hansi Flick's side found themselves in a similar situation with Dani Olmo. The issue concerns La Liga's wage cap, wit clubs required to trim their bill - ideally by offloading senior players - if they want to add any new arrivals to their squad.",
      "They were eventually able to register Olmo in time for the start of the 2024-25 season, before being forced to jump through hoops for a second time in January. This time around, Rashford isn't the only one facing the same situation.",
      "Barca completed a loan move for Rashford with an option to buy, and he - along with new keeper Joan Garcia - need to be accommodated. According to Sport (via Football Espana), the club will also need to re-register Wojciech Szczesny after the Polish international's contract expired and he signed fresh terms.",
      "The club are also looking to register youngsters Gerard Martin and Marc Bernal as first-teamers, as well as new signing Roony Bardghji. Swedish winger Bardghji joined from FC Copenhagen earlier in the summer, but will reportedly only be added to the first-team squad after the other five.",
      "Barcelona will get their campaign underway against Mallorca on August 16. They have previously expressed confidence over doing what they need to do to ensure Rashford can play a part, but they're not there yet.",
      "A number of players have already left this summer, including Pablo Torre - who could feature against them for Mallorca on the opening day. Clement Lenglet and Pau Victor are among the others to leave permanently, while Ansu Fati's loan to Monaco will see the Ligue 1 club cover a portion of the player's wages.",
      "The future of Marc Andre ter Stegen could remain a key factor when it comes to Barca registering new players. The German goalkeeper missed most of last season through injury, and Barca had looked to register Garcia as an injury replacement - thereby not having to find extra wage budget for him.",
      "Those short-term replacements account for players expected to miss four months or more, and Ter Stegen has publicly denied this to be the case. According to reports in Spain, the club have begun disciplinary proceedings against the former Borussia Monchengladbach stopper, who is still Barca's captain - though some board members are said to have questioned whether he should retain the armband.",
      "The injury clause allowed Barca to register Olmo last season. Danish defender Christensen missed the first half of the campaign with an achilles issue, but Olmo needed to be re-registered upon the centre-back's January return.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Simon Jordan has told Benjamin Sesko to head to St James' Park over Old Trafford, stating the RB Leipzig striker will have \"less scrutiny\" playing under Eddie Howe than Ruben Amorim. The former Crystal Palace chairman admits he had \"reservations in the past\" over the Newcastle manager, but he now believes the Carabao Cup winners are the right team for Sesko to thrive in.",
      "Newcastle and Manchester United are locked in a transfer battle to sign the 22-year-old. The two sides have submitted big bids to bring Sesko to their respective clubs.",
      "The Magpies struck first with a rejected offer before coming back with an improved proposal worth £70million plus add-ons. However, the Red Devils have lodged a bid of their own worth £65.1m plus a further £8.7m in add-ons, and a final decision from the Slovenian international looks to be imminent.",
      "Jordan appeared on talkSPORT to discuss the choice Sesko faces, admitting that if money weren't an issue, then Newcastle should be his prime destination.",
      "\"If I were in his shoes, if the economics of the deal were that I wasn't being compromised financially by going to Newcastle over Manchester United, I think it's a great move,\" Jordan said, before he went on to discuss the former Bournemouth boss.",
      "\"I think Eddie Howe is a brilliant manager – I had my reservations about him in the past – I've had conversations already. I like him very much, and I think he's done a brilliant job.",
      "\"So I would be looking at Newcastle rather than Man United.\"",
      "Jordan went on to note that everything Sesko does would be looked at under a microscope when playing under Amorim at United, whereas he would have more freedom to grow while developing under Howe. Jordan added: \"I think because Newcastle comes with expectation, but doesn't come with the same pressure that Man United comes from.",
      "\"Whilst people focus on Newcastle, they focus on it because Newcastle makes a lot of noise, because it's a very passionate football club and the fans are very motivated by it. It doesn't have the day-to-day scrutiny that Man United has.",
      "\"It doesn't matter what happens, you can fart in the corridor of Man United – that's heard around the world. It's not the same at Newcastle.\"",
      "United are reportedly confident that Sesko will be heading to the north west of England to add to their attacking line, having secured the signatures of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and ex-Wolves man Matheus Cunha already this summer.",
      "Sesko, though, is considered a ready replacement at Newcastle for Alexander Isak, whose form has understandably caught the attention of Premier League champions Liverpool. The Reds have already submitted a £110m bid for the Swede – which has been rejected – but Howe looks destined to sell the wantaway star should the Magpies first land Sesko.",
      "The Red Devils are in yet another period of transition. In November 2024, they appointed former Sporting CP boss Amorim to help the club compete back in the European places of the Premier League, but another disappointing campaign last season saw them ultimately finish in 15th and without a trophy.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle are on the up after securing their first piece of silverware in 70 years in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool. They finished fifth last year in the Premier League and are set to compete in the Champions League once again this season.",
      "Meanwhile, United will be without European football this campaign after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "All of these things may well factor into Sesko's decision to pick black and white or Manchester red, with both sets of fans eagerly awaiting to see his choice made soon.",

      "The future of Liverpool target Alexander Isak could yet be impacted with old rivals Manchester United. While United aren't in for Isak themselves, their transfer battle with Newcastle over Benjamin Sesko could have a knock-on effect on the Swede.",
      "Liverpool's initial approach for Isak was knocked back by Newcastle, who want close to £150million for their leading man. They have bid roughly half that for Slovenia international Sesko - £69.5m plus up to £8m in add-ons - but dont have a clear run at the RB Leipzig star.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Liverpool have no plans to make a renewed bid for Isak as things stand. However, the same publication indicates things might change if the Magpies sign a new striker.",
      "Manchester United have a chance to throw a spanner in the works, then. If they are able to beat Eddie Howe's side to Sesko then, in all likelihood, Isak will be going nowhere.",
      "The latest developments come as United and Newcastle both brace for a decision from Sesko - with a deadline potentially coming as soon as Tuesday night. The striker is ready to trade the Bundesliga for the Premier League, but both clubs will feel they have a case.",
      "It has been a frustrating summer so far for Newcastle. Anthony Elanga their only senior outfield signing, joining in a £55m move from Nottingham Forest, while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has joined from Southampton.",
      "They have missed out on other targets, though, with French striker Hugo Ekitike opting for Liverpool and Joao Pedro choosing Chelsea. It's not just forwards who have looked elsewhere, either, with centre-back Dean Huijsen moving to Real Madrid and goalkeeper James Trafford deciding to rejoin Manchester City.",
      "One man who could yet move to St James' Park is Yoane Wissa. Eddie Howe's side have so far failed to meet Brentford's asking price for the Congolese international, who has now returned to training in West London, but there is still time left in the window.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" Newcastle manager Howe said over the weekend. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us. I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity.",
      "\"It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change til the window shuts.\"",

      "Rio Ngumoha wasn't short of offers when deciding to sign for Liverpool, with Jurgen Klopp indirectly playing a key role in his arrival at Anfield. The 16-year-old signed for the Reds last summer after spending eight years in Chelsea's academy.",
      "Regarded as one of the Blues' most promising players, he was offered a scholarship by the Premier League side. But he opted to join Liverpool's academy, where he initially joined the club's Under-18s squad.",
      "Over a year since his signing, the teenager has emerged as one of the country's most highly-rated talents thanks to his exploits in pre-season this summer with the Premier League champions. With four goals and assists to his name in six games, he capped off the club's season preparations with a stunning solo goal in a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao on Monday in front of fans at Anfield.",
      "Realising that Ngumoha's ceiling is otherworldly, Liverpool supporters would certainly gain extra satisfaction knowing he rejected Manchester United last summer thanks to the work the Reds had already done to secure his future.",
      "According to The Athletic, the winger had held talks with the Red Devils last June, who laid out their plans for him if he decided to leave Chelsea. While pushing for his signing, United chiefs conceded defeat, believing they were behind Liverpool in the chase for his signature.",
      "While it was Arne Slot at the helm when Ngumoha arrived, credit has been handed to Klopp over the role he may have played in the forward's decision to switch clubs.",
      "The German – who left the club last summer after announcing his decision to leave earlier that season – was known for his penchant for bringing through youngsters into the first-team at Liverpool. The Daily Mail reported that Ngumoha's decision to join Liverpool was motivated by Klopp's methods of integrating academy players into his squad.",
      "The Reds' Carabao Cup final victory over Chelsea last year was directly pointed to as an important factor, as Klopp fielded six Liverpool academy graduates at Wembley. While Caoimhin Kelleher and Conor Bradley started the game, Jayden Danns, Bobby Clark, James McConnell and Jarell Quansah all came on.",
      "Prior to his Liverpool move, Ngumoha had made just one appearance for Chelsea's U21 team and had yet to make his professional debut. He's since done exactly that with the Reds, where he started in their 4-0 win against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup earlier this year and has played a starring role in pre-season.",
      "The winger discussed his experience playing with the first-team this summer while opening up on the influence Mohamed Salah has had on himself and the rest of the young players at Liverpool. \"Training with the best team in the world; the players that you get to train with, you learn from them and you really test yourself against them,\" he said in his first Liverpoolfc.com interview this past week.",
      "\"It has been very good. Patience is key. I don’t want to rush anything. I’m young. Just keep working hard, pushing hard and just showing the manager what I can really do, and affect the team. They really help the young players – especially me, Trey [Nyoni].",
      "\"They help us really settle in. [Mohamed] Salah was one of my role models growing up obviously, so it’s really big [to be] learning from him. Everyone is really professional and you can see why they’re at the top. They’re always thinking about football, recovery, little things like eating right. So, [you] definitely can learn a lot from them.\"",

      "But latest reports suggest that the decision will ultimately come down to which club Sesko would rather turn out for this season - and Sesko is now expected to confirm his intentions by tonight.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday it emerged that United formally submitted a bid of £73.8m for the 22-year-old, speeding up the process that will see him leave the Bundesliga outfit. Newcastle were first to lodge a formal bid that was rejected. Following talks with the Bundesliga club, Eddie Howe's side submitted an improved offer of £69.5m plus £8.6m in add-ons on Monday.",
      "There are added considerations however that could also end up impacting Premier League champions Liverpool. Should Sesko decide to move to Old Trafford instead of St James' Park it would increase the chances of Alexander Isak remaining with the Toon despite expressing his desire to explore new opportunities amid interest from Anfield.",
      "Although the Toon’s asking price remains some way higher than what the Premier League champions appear willing to pay having last week had a first bid rejected.",

      "Maguire was surplus to requirements under Erik ten Hag, but opted against leaving last summer despite Premier League interest. Ten Hag was dismissed in October, and his successor Amorim found a role for the £80m man before United triggered a contract extension for him in January.",
      "Now 32, the former Leicester defender is out of contract at the end of this season and free to talk to overseas suitors in January. If player and club have their say, though, he'll be going nowhere.",
      "According to The Mail, Maguire is keen to sign an extension which would see him play out the remainder of his career with United. The club are said to be on the same page, though talks are yet to have begun.",
      "Amorim has included Maguire in a six-man leadership group, along with Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui and captain Bruno Fernandes. This makes an exit unlikely, despite five Premier League clubs looking to pounce.",
      "The interest in Maguire doesn't just come from England, either. According to the same Mail report, two unnamed Italian clubs have explored a move, along with three from the Premier League.",
      "There have also been suggestions of interest from Turkey and France. The five approaches from England and Italy have been knocked back, though, with no indication right now that an exit might follow.",

      "\"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "United have been trimming their squad in other areas, with Marcus Rashford joining Barcelona on loan and Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen leaving on a free. More exits are expected, with Jadon Sancho among those in the shop window.",

      "But if he chooses United ahead of Newcastle, then Isak could find himself in no-man’s land with the new season just 10 days away. And that scenario is looking increasingly likely with the Bundesliga side keen on taking United misfit Rasmus Hojlund in the deal.",

      "\"United Road. See you Saturday,\" De Gea wrote on social media. The keeper's comments were met with positivity from United supporters, some of whom even suggested he'd be preferable to the English side's current options in the home goal.",

      "There was room for improvement in the last of those games, a 2-2 draw with Everton, which prompted captain Bruno Fernandes to ask questions. Ruben Amorim's side will now hope to go out with a bang before beginning their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on August 17.",

      "Reflecting on the tour, he added: \"We're happy with the way things are going. We play well, score goals and I'm happy how the team is developing themselves. Let's see. I think it's going to be important to have a good start against Arsenal and then everything is possible.\"",

      "United's bid includes a package of £65.2m plus £8.6m in add-ons as they attempt to convince Sesko Old Trafford is the right place to continue developing his career, despite not having any European football to offer.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, can give Sesko the chance to play Champions League football this season - hoping he can replace Alexander Isak amid talks with Liverpool over a £150m deal.",
      "But United are hoping they have another ace up their sleeve in Vivell, who signed the forward for Leipzig in the first place.",
      "And before Leipzig, when Vivell was at Red Bull Salzburg, he reportedly discovered Sesko when he was a 16-year-old and signed him from Slovenian club Domzale. According to Bild, this could make Vivell United's secret weapon in negotiations.",
      "As someone he trusts, Sesko might prefer to join United having worked with Vivell in the past, even though he would likely be the main man at Newcastle.",
      "United have shown that they still have that 'big club pull' despite being out of Europe after signing Wolves star Matheus Cunha £62.5m and securing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo for £71m.",
      "Sesko now has a huge decision to make between United and Newcastle as he prepares to leave Leipzig after two seasons. He scored 21 goals in 45 appearances across all competitions last season.",

      "He is United's number one striker target, but the club still have some alternatives if he does end up chosing Newcastle.",
      "United initially targeted Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins before being put off the club's £60m price tag for a player five years older. They have also been monitoring Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson but it is believed the Blues want at least £80m for the Senegalese star.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been told he could command a bigger salary than expected as Manchester United and Newcastle battle for his signature. Both Premier League teams have tabled bids for the RB Leipzig striker as they look to secure their top summer target.",
      "Newcastle were first to make a formal offer for the 22-year-old that was rejected by the Bundesliga club. The Magpies then returned with an improved bid of £69.5m plus £8.6m in add-ons on Monday.",
      "The Red Devils then made their move on Tuesday with a proposed deal worth £65.2m plus £8.6m in further payments. Sesko, who netted 21 goals in 45 appearances across all competitions last season, is believed to be training separately from the Leipzig squad as the race to sign him heats up.",
      "The Slovenian international has now been advised by former United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster to turn the situation to his advantage by using it to leverage more money in wages. The 42-year-old also urged him to choose a switch to Old Trafford rather than take on the burden of potentially having to replace Alexander Isak's impressive goal haul at Newcastle.",
      "\"If he goes to Newcastle, the Champions League is a massive draw, but he's got some big boots to fill there with Isak,\" said Foster on his Fozcast podcast. \" As a striker, I don't know if you necessarily need that kind of excess pressure as well.",
      "\"Whereas at United, he hasn't got it so much. They're not the Man United of old but in stature, it's still Manchester United. You're going to get the same wages no matter where you go. The fact that you've got two [clubs interested] means you might just be able to bump it up by an extra £50,000 a week.\"",
      "Newcastle have opted to chase Sesko after Isak, who scored 23 goals across all competitions last season, told the club he wants to leave St James' Park following interest from Liverpool. The reigning Premier League champions had an initial offer for Isak rejected last week, but are expected to return with a second bid.",
      "By comparison, United are looking to improve on Rasmus Hojlund, who boasted a less impressive tally of 10 goals last term. The Red Devils have already bolstered their forward line this summer by signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for a combined sum of £133.5m.",
      "According to a report by the Athletic, United are eyeing other options in case they lose out to Newcastle. Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson is one target who is understood to be on their radar and could be allowed to leave Stamford Bridge this summer subject to a reasonable offer.",
      "Meanwhile, French outlet L'Equipe claims that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani is another possibility United are considering. Juventus were the original favourites for Muani, but the deal is said to have hit a stumbling block.",
      "Sesko was left out of Leipzig's squad for their pre-season game against Atalanta on Saturday. When asked for the reason for his exclusion, head coach Marcel Schafer said it was \"obvious.\"",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that, but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes Luke Shaw's claim about Manchester United shedding the \"stragglers\" in the squad highlights Ruben Amorim's positive effect. Amorim, 40, has taken a no-nonsense approach to United's squad this summer.",
      "One of his first acts was to banish the so-called 'Bomb Squad' featuring Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. The latter has been loaned to Barcelona, but the other trio were left out of United's pre-season tour in the USA and told they will be training separately from the rest of the squad.",
      "Last season, Sancho, Antony and Rashford were loaned to Chelsea, Real Betis and Aston Villa, respectively, while Garnacho was told to find a new club after he publicly criticised Amorim shortly after United's loss to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "New recruits Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have now been brought in, and Shaw recently praised Amorim's tough love approach that has managed to rid the club of \"stragglers\" holding the group back.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents show, the ex-United captain reacted to Shaw's comments. He said: \"It was quite a damning statement, wasn't it?",
      "\"When I heard that, I was like, 'I wonder what the next meet-up is going to be like if he sees any of those guys.' I think I'd have had something to say about that if I thought it was about me.",
      "\"Then you go, 'Maybe they don't say anything, because they might think and know it is true.' But there's a confidence in there with him that goes, 'You know what? They know that I know what went wrong. So I can say this with my chest.'",
      "\"That's what it feels like. Also, the environment he is feeling now would have to be a positive one for him to come out and speak like that.\"",
      "When asked specifically about Shaw's place at Old Trafford and whether he was referencing the aforementioned quartet, Ferdinand added: \"His stature within the squad, I noticed it while I was on tour. He has a very strong stature within the squad. He's been there, I think, over 10 years now.",
      "\"He has seen it all there. All the bad times, he's seen it. He is one of the most experienced and most Manchester United players within that squad. So, I don't think he has any qualms coming out like that.",
      "\"I think you have to have seen enough to be able to go and talk like that. So I think it's a strong statement. I don't think there's any two that he's directed at those four players, because they are the ones sitting on the outside.\"",
      "Last season was a chastening one for the Red Devils. They finished 15th and only mustered 42 points and 44 goals. Their last chance of redemption in the Europa League final also ended with them losing to Tottenham in a lacklustre fashion.",
      "But the signs are looking positive for the Red Devils, as they won the Premier League Summer Series in the USA. They beat West Ham United 2-1 and Bournemouth 4-1, before drawing 2-2 with Everton.",
      "Of course, the real measure will be how they start the Premier League campaign. Their opening fixtures are ominous, as they host Arsenal, Burnley and Chelsea, while also travelling to Fulham, Manchester City and Brentford in their first six matches.",

      "Online bidding with auctioneers Ewbank’s starts on August 19 - and it is estimated that the boots will go under the hammer for between £20,000 and £40,000.",
      "The boots were first commissioned by Embee Jewels of London after former fashion model and dancer Luisa Di Marco came up with the inspirational idea of designing the world ’s most expensive boots as part of the charity appeal.",
      "Ferdinand, who won six Premier League titles with United as well as the Champions League, Club World Cup and the Club World Cup, played 81 times for England during a glittering career that also included spells with West Ham, Bournemouth, Leeds and QPR. The 46-year-old launched a media career after hanging up his boots and is a respected television pundit.",
      "The boots were commissioned by Di Marco and fashion designer Scott Henshall after consultation with Ferdinand’s management company. They were customised further with spray paint and graffiti-style artwork by rapper and film producer Goldie.",
      "Both boots have Ferdinand’s name machine-stitched to the side in capital letters and have been applied with an 18 ct rose gold shield, hallmarked London 2009, along with the sponsor’s mark EJ.",
      "Each 7.3 x 5cm shield has a round cut ruby set border with an estimated total ruby weight of 1.80 carats. At the centre sits the number 5, set with white round brilliant cut diamonds and round cut black diamonds set as a detail.",
      "The tongue to each boot is set with a 2.4cm diameter gold circular black diamond-set panel, and a No. 90 set with white diamonds, with an estimated total white diamond weight of 0.25 ct. A large black diamond-set Nike Swoosh to one side and a smaller white diamond-set Nike Swoosh decorate the sides, with an estimated total white diamond weight of 0.82 ct.",
      "The back of each heel is even more flamboyant. Adorned with an attached 7.6 x 6.8cm gold panel depicting a winged heart, sword and crown motif, with black enamel lettering spelling the word 'Core', each heart is set with round-cut rubies, with an estimated total ruby weight of 1.12 ct.",
      "The white round brilliant cut diamonds set in the design have an estimated total white diamond weight of 4.54 ct.",
      "Completing the vision in bling is a pair of gold-tipped laces, each set with round brilliant cut white diamonds at the terminals, and with an estimated weight of 0.22 ct each.",
      "The boots were first sold at a Private VIP Auction event in 2009, hosted by James Corden. Also up for auction at the time were England team-mates’ John Terry and Wayne Rooney's match-worn and signed boots covered in jewels.",
      "Ewbank’s specialist Tom Duggan said: “Rio Ferdinand’s gold and diamond encrusted boots must rank as one of the most extraordinary pieces of sporting memorabilia we have ever offered.",
      "“One of the best things about them is that they brought together rare talents in sport, design, film and music to create them, and of course it was all for a good cause. The buyer at that original charity auction is the seller here.”",
      "Live online bidding for Sporting Memorabilia auction is available via www.ewbankauctions.co.uk",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have made a £73.8million bid for Benjamin Sesko, as they move to beat Newcastle in the race for the RB Leipzig striker. Sesko, 22, is both clubs' top target, as they each push to sign a striker in the final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "Newcastle were first to lodge a formal bid that was rejected. Following talks with the Bundesliga club, Eddie Howe's side submitted an improved offer of £69.5m plus £8.6m in add-ons on Monday.",
      "United have now made their own move, with a proposal worth £65.2m plus £8.6m in further payments. It's understood that Sesko is training away from Leipzig's first-team squad amid the race to sign him.",
      "Newcastle's decision to pursue the Slovenia international comes after Alexander Isak told club chiefs that he wants to leave amid concrete interest from Liverpool. The Magpies rejected Liverpool's opening bid last week but they're braced for a second offer.",
      "United, on the other hand, want to upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who's available for just £30m after two difficult seasons at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have already signed two forwards this summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for a combined £133.5m.",
      "United's interest in Sesko dates back to when he was 16 and playing for Slovenian club Domzale. The Red Devils' new director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, also knows plenty about the in-demand 22-year-old.",
      "Vivell signed Sesko for both Salzburg and Leipzig during his spells with the two Red Bull-run clubs, and he's hoping to do it for a third time in his role at United.",
      "Howe has been tight-lipped on Newcastle's interest in Sesko. When asked about the ex-Red Bull Salzburg wonderkid, the Magpies boss told Chronicle Live: \"I am sorry to sound like a broken record, I am aware of what is happening, but I am not dealing with it.",
      "\"I woke up today and had two training sessions then came straight here. I am finding out what is happening after it has happened, so we will try to bring the best to the football club - I will make that clear - but I can't talk about individual targets.\"",
      "Who should Benjamin Sesko chose - Newcastle or Manchester United? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "After Sesko was absent for Leipzig's pre-season friendly with Atalanta last week, managing director Marcel Schafer confirmed that approaches had been made, without giving specifics.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that, but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches,\" Schafer said. \"It's obvious what has happened.\"",
      "Now, RBL have both Premier League clubs pushing to land their prized asset, with the Slovenian tasked with deciding on which United he really wants.",

      "According to a new report from the Athletic, United are also considering potential alternatives to Sesko if Newcastle win the race with Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson on their radar. Chelsea are said to be open to selling Jackson this summer after signing Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, but only if they receive an 'acceptable proposal'.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe, meanwhile, are reporting that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani is another option United are considering. Juventus were the frontrunners for Muani, but it is claimed that deal has now stalled.",
      "As a result, United could now make a move for the 26-year-old, although Tottenham are also said to be interested in Muani.",
      "The news comes after United captain Bruno Fernandes urged the club to make more signings before the new season starts. \"It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,\" Fernandes said after a 2-2 draw with Everton in pre-season.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand believes Arsenal's teenage sensation Max Dowman is the most exciting English talent since Wayne Rooney. Dowman, despite not even being old enough to sit his GCSEs, has left Gunners talent drooling with his talent during pre-season.",
      "In a summer featuring the arrivals of stars like Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and others, the player Arsenal fans haven't been able to stop watching is the 15-year-old, a product of the club's fabled academy system. Dowman, who has been playing above his age group for a number of years and spent much of last term training with the first team, was included on the north Londoners' pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "And while he may have presumed he was only there for the experience, boss Mikel Arteta had other ideas, desploying him in their friendlies against AC Milan, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, where he immediately made an impression. Dowman, who was born in 2009, has already impressed Declan Rice and the Gunners boss with his mature displays.",
      "Ferdinand, who won his fourth Premier League title the year Dowman was born, has been so captivated by the teen, he thinks he is just as exciting as a young Rooney was. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, the ex-England captain said: \"Dowman excites me on another level. This kid is different.\"",
      "When co-host Joel Beya told Ferdinand, who already sang Dowman's praises last month, that some people are calling the teenager the best talent England has produced since Rooney, he instantly replied: \"Yes. I am saying the same thing.”",
      "After Beya suggested Ferdinand should take it easy with such a comparison, he hit back: \"What? Have you seen him? They’re different. This kid is not Rooney.",
      "\"Just let me put it out there, he is not Rooney. He is not built. He hasn’t got a hairy chest. He hasn’t got a beard at the age of 16. Rooney was a man. A man-child.”",
      "Rooney was responsible for perhaps the most spectacular breakthrough in Premier League history when he made his Everton debut at the age of 16. He came off the bench against Arsenal and crashed home a strike from 30 yards, which smashed off the underside of the crossbar on its way into the net in 2003.",
      "He went on to become United and England's highest-ever goalscorer, until Harry Kane broke the latter record in an away clash against Italy in 2023. While Ferdinand has compared the breakouts of Rooney and Dowman, he did insist they are different types of players.",
      "He added: \"The thing with Wayne Rooney is that he had guile, but he came on with brute force. He was like, 'You’re going to know about me because I’m going to force it down your throat.’",
      "\"This kid is more subtle, more technical. All he is going to do is have people on ice skates, slipping and sliding everywhere. Very rarely do you see a player actually get near him and touch him.",
      "\"He is that elusive. He’s a player who will excite you, get you off your seat. You’ll be going, 'Have you seen that?’ He’s making defenders into memes.”",
      "Dowman is yet to make his full, competitive senior debut for the Gunners, but he appears to have a great chance this season. Arteta has a record of promoting youngsters, having made Ethan Nwaneri the youngest player in Premier League history when he brought him on during a 3-0 victory at Brentford in 2022, aged just 15 years and 181 days old.",

      "Harry Maguire admits that Manchester United's lack of European football this season gives them 'no excuses' in the Premier League. Maguire, 32, has said that the extra time to prepare for league matches should be an advantage for his team-mates and boss Ruben Amorim, who'll have more hours to work with them on the training ground.",
      "United manager Amorim often bemoaned the Red Devils' busy schedule after he was appointed in November. Due to having a fixture either in Europe or domestically every three to four days for the vast majority of the campaign, the Portuguese found it even more difficult to implement his system.",
      "But that's been flipped on its head this term. After finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final last time out, Amorim's side won't be in Europe whatsoever.",
      "It's only the second time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 that the Red Devils will go into a season without European football. For Maguire, he sees it as an opportunity to make sure that they're in tip-top condition to enjoy a much better Premier League campaign.",
      "\"I just want to be part of a successful team this season,\" the defender told MUTV. \"I think last season was a tough season for everyone individually, but also as a team, as a squad, as a club.",
      "\"This season, there are no excuses. We're going to have a lot of time to prepare for the Premier League games, and we've got to make sure we're ready. So, for myself, it's making sure I'm available, I'm fit, I'm ready to go, and give everything I can to this team and this club.\"",
      "Maguire added that he and his team-mates know Amorim's system 'a lot better' following their pre-season tour of the USA, where they largely worked on tactics in training. \"It's something that he reiterated, that we didn't have enough time on the training pitch,\" the England international continued.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"This pre-season, it's been tough on the legs, but the majority of it has been tactical. So, it's nice to do the drills that are tactical rather than running around poles and running around the pitch.",
      "\"It's been an enjoyable pre-season, but a pre-season that we've all learnt from. We know the system a lot better, and we've just got to take that into the games now.\"",

      "Manchester United have been down this road before.",
      "After signing Rasmus Hojlund from Atlanta in the 2023 summer transfer window, United are now trying to sign another young striker in the form of RB Leipzig ace Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United are understood to have submitted an opening offer for the striker worth just under £74million. It is a significant fee for a player that has never scored more than 15 goals in a single season in one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "The Slovenian international scored 13 Bundesliga goals for Leipzig last season and 14 the season before. It is a respectable return for a player that only turned 22 at the very end of May, but is it good enough to command such an eye-watering price tag?",
      "Newcastle United have, of course, also expressed plenty of interest in the former Red Bull Salzburg striker, making two bids for his services thus far. Their second offer is reportedly worth more than United's opening bid.",
      "Attracting such interest from two Premier League clubs suggests both United and Newcastle are firmly of the belief Sesko is a striker that has the capability to come to England and make all the difference.",
      "The Reds, after finishing last season with a goal difference of -10, have prioritised attacking signings this summer, already bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. However, the missing piece in the jigsaw remains a No.9.",
      "In Cunha and Mbeumo, United have signed two players with proven Premier League records. They scored 35 league goals between them last term and have plundered 71 career goals in England's top flight.",
      "As a result of their additions to Ruben Amorim's squad, United are within their rights to believe they can take a gamble on Sesko and deploy him at the tip of what would be a new-look attack. The Slovenian would be able to lean on them for support to help ease the burden on his shoulders.",
      "United have also expressed interest in Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins recently. He boasts a proven Premier League record and has plundered 35 goals league since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Watkins would offer a greater guarantee of hitting the ground running at Old Trafford and providing immediate results in front of goal. He knows the league inside out and has a very respectable record.",
      "On the flip side, Sesko has a higher ceiling than the England international, and potential is what United would be buying. Only turning 22 just over two months ago, he is still raw and developing.",
      "However, United, ahead of the start of this season, want to try and implement a long-term strategy under Amorim that can lead them to a position from which they will be able to launch a genuine title charge for the 2027/28 season. 'Project 150' was unveiled last year and it is has been created with the ambition of United winning the Premier League title in 2028 to coincide with their 150th anniversary.",
      "United's aim for the coming season, first and foremost, has to be securing a place back in Europe for the 2026/27 campaign. The Reds will be without European football this season for the first time since 2014/15.",
      "Although United will have fight from a low base to secure their place back in Europe for next season, they will be confident of doing so with the new signings they have made so far. Furthermore, a full pre-season for Amorim already appears to be paying off.",
      "Signing Sesko as a long-term option is something United can, to a degree, get away with this summer amid their additions of proven Premier League operators in Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "The club, in the last 12 months or so, has shown through their recruitment they are prepared to sign young players with a long-term plan in mind.",
      "Sesko is by no means the finished article, and signing him would represent another massive risk in the attacking department, but there is no doubt about his potential, meaning he could prove to be a shrewd addition in the long-term.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "\"We won't allow some natural optimism and a couple of shiny new signings to deflect from the bigger off-field picture. Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and in our opinion is helping keep them in charge.",
      "\"So on 17th August, we protest not just against the Glazers, but now also against Jim Ratcliffe – a man once seen by many, including ourselves, as a possible saviour, a beacon of hope but now revealed as complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is.",
      "\"This is no longer just about ownership; this is about survival – the survival of our identity, our community, and our values.\"",
      "The spokesman added the protest is for \"every fan who has been silenced, evicted, priced out and disregarded\", adding \"this is about the future of football\".",

      "After missing out on Liam Delap in early-June, United have since been chasing shadows in their striker search. However, it was never unrealistic to suggest sourcing their most important signing could take the most amount of time.",
      "Right now, Sesko occupies top spot on United's wish list. However, unlike Newcastle, they are yet to table a formal offer for the Slovenian international, who scored 21 goals for Leipzig last season.",
      "United do not want to get drawn into a bidding war for the striker, and understandably so, and it is believed they want assurances from Sesko that he wants to move to Old Trafford before potentially making an opening offer.",
      "Despite already spending more than £130m this summer, United are confident of financing a deal for Sesko before overseeing sales. United expect to save £14m this season on Marcus Rashford's wages, they have banked £5m from Chelsea's decision not to sign Jadon Sancho permanently and have raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses inserted in previous sales.",
      "In a better financial position than what was originally anticipated at the start of the window, United have resources available to them to sign Sesko. But is he worth the fee Leipzig are demanding?",
      "As with any transfer pursuit, United's interest in Sesko has split opinion. Many recognise his high ceiling and potential, and also acknowledge his respectable goalscoring record in Germany and Austria, but can United afford to take such a big risk at this moment in time?",
      "On one hand, supporters are within their rights to say yes, acknowledging the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, of which 35 were scored in the Premier League. On the flip side, others believe United should go for somebody who is more established and proven, no doubt mindful of the gamble United took on Hojlund two years ago.",
      "Last week, it was confirmed Ollie Watkins had also made his way onto United's list of options, but Aston Villa are currently refusing to sell him. He has three years left on his contract and scored 16 Premier League goals last season.",
      "However, if United are capable of throwing big-money at Leipzig in an attempt to sign Sesko, they will almost certainly have the funds available to try and change Villa's stance.",
      "Watkins is seven years Sesko's senior, meaning his ceiling is not as high, but what he does boast is a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Despite never scoring 20 goals or more in a Premier League campaign, the England international has reached double figures in each of the last five seasons since joining Villa in 2020, scoring 75 league goals. He has plundered 87 goals in all competitions for Villa.",
      "At 29, Watkins is not necessarily as attractive a signing as what Sesko would be, but there is a stronger likelihood of him coming in and hitting the ground running. He has scored 35 Premier League goals in the last two seasons, assisting 21.",
      "Having already swooped for two of the Premier League's best players in Mbeumo and Cunha this summer, Watkins would be a fitting addition to come in and spearhead United's attack.",
      "Sesko currently sits at the top of the wish list, but it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to Watkins and his record.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Three games, two wins, one draw, eight goals and one trophy marked a positive pre-season tour for Manchester United as they won the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.",
      "Beyond the results and performances, United have looked fitter than at this stage in recent years, the manager is secure and no clouds are hovering over the squad.",
      "United's schedule was more streamlined and Chicago was a perfect base. The Endeavor Health Performance Center they trained at only opened this year and the players could socialise in a superb city with next-to-no hassle.",
      "The past fortnight has provided a promising platform for a successful season. With the transfer window open for four more weeks, United are certain to be active with incomings and outgoings and there are unaddressed issues that were apparent before they took off for Chicago.",
      "Here are five talking points from their tour:",
      "Bruno Fernandes, typically, was one of three players to start all three tour games and scored three goals. Fernandes ended the match against Everton in midfield, where he started against Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "Fernandes will flitter between the No.10 and the No.8 over the course of the season as United have a surfeit of options to play behind the striker. Even when Matheus Cunha operated as the false nine against Everton, Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Mason Mount had stints as one of the 10s.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another option as Amorim ponders how to enhance a midfield arguably as in urgent need of an upgrade as up front. Whenever Fernandes eventually departs United, they are not going to require a playmaker for a while.",
      "United's intention to loan out Toby Collyer all but confirms a midfield recruit is lined up. Amorim criticised the \"lack of pace\" in the area after the goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and he hooked Mainoo before the hour mark against Everton.",
      "The bigger issue in the 2-2 draw was Manuel Ugarte, who was stuck against the Toffees. Everton preyed on Ugarte's limitations and he wilted against an aggressive press. Ugarte sought protection from the referee and when he attempted to match Everton's physicality he committed an obvious foul.",
      "Casemiro is undeniably a squad player and not even in the new six-man leadership group, having been a part of it under Erik ten Hag. Collyer's three career starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One. Amorim has belief in Mainoo but seems caught between two stools as to his role.",
      "Amorim suggested he was \"happy\" that United underperformed against Everton, easily the least accomplished of their performances, as the players would not be lulled into a false sense of security back at Carrington. This has been a buoyant United tour but the midfield has to be improved.",
      "United's second-best player last season was another playmaker and Amad started behind Rasmus Hojlund in Chicago. In the other two games, he was on the right wing and that appears to be the role Amorim has settled on for him.",
      "Amorim had Geovany Quenda to service Viktor Gyokeres in his final months at Sporting and Amad is a similar profile: a young left-footed winger expected to assume defensive responsibilities whilst offering attacking intent down the right-hand side.",
      "With £133.5million worth of new forwards and the totemic Fernandes in the attacking trident against Everton, United had dexterous playmakers to drop deep and spring through Amad, playing on the shoulder of the last defender. It led to a chance for Cunha and the penalty that Fernandes converted.",
      "Amad played on the wing in Amorim's first United match in charge at Ipswich. Four other wingers are in the bomb squad, either unwilling or incapable of meeting Amorim's demands.",
      "Another 'hidden' attacking asset is Leny Yoro, who is literally stepping up and playing more on the front foot.",
      "One of the last kicks from Rasmus Hojlund in the States was his boot against the post. He was appalled that Patrick Dorgu had shot at goal rather than gone across goal.",
      "Dorgu was well within his rights to shoot. Hojlund may have strayed offside, too. We have become accustomed to that reaction from Hojlund and he vented at Diogo Dalot in Stockholm a little over two weeks ago.",
      "It cannot be easy for Hojlund to continue as United's No.9 when they are enquiring about almost any attainable striker. He is in an identical position to Erik ten Hag last year when United asked every Tom, Dick and Harry if they would take over as manager. Ten Hag remained in situ after the head-hunting but was eventually summoned to the guillotine.",
      "Hojlund is digging his heels in amid United's efforts to flog him but it is unsustainable and could jeopardise the squad harmony. Hojlund was socialising with Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as recently as United's penultimate night in Chicago. United need to be transparent with the Dane.",
      "This has been the most upbeat United pre-season since 2017. The quirk of that is United entered that summer having just won the Europa League final.",
      "Denying the 'bomb squad' members a seat on the plane to Chicago has indubitably helped. The players have publicly backed Amorim's handling of players who have caused him and the club problems. United are not treading on eggshells with Marcus Rashford any more after he was whisked away to Barcelona.",
      "Ten Hag had Jadon Sancho foisted onto him for pre-season last year and his working relationship with Rashford was practically irreparable. Senior figures at United want to provide unequivocal backing for Amorim and his authority is yet to be challenged over his handling of a player.",
      "The days when Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba rode roughshod over the manager are thankfully over.",
      "Andre Onana is expected to be match-fit for the Arsenal fixture but if he isn't then a 39-year-old deserves to be between the sticks for United.",
      "This tour was additional evidence that Altay Bayindir is the third-best of United's senior 'keepers. In a summer where United are exploring the possibility of recruiting a new goalie, it is peculiar that they are not actively looking to shift Bayindir, whose reputation hinges on a couple of penalty saves in a cup tie.",
      "Bayindir was utterly unconvincing again in the draw with Everton whereas Tom Heaton kept competently against Bournemouth. Onana has to demonstrate clear evidence that he has honed his technique when he does return and the first-choice goalkeeper position can be parked for a year.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Ruben Amorim's side rounded off their tour of the United States on Sunday night by being crowned champions of the Premier League Summer Series. United drew 2-2 against Everton to make it two wins and one draw during the tour.",
      "The squad will now fly back to England and return to Carrington. There is now less than two weeks until the new Premier League season gets underway against Arsenal.",
      "The summer transfer window is still open, with United continuing to be linked with several potential new signings. A new striker is the priority for Amorim, with Benjamin Sesko at the top of their list.",
      "Newcastle are battling hard for the RB Leipzig striker's signature, but it has been suggested that United are the current favourites. There are also reports linking United with moves for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins and Paris Saint-Germain star Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "United have until September 1 to complete their transfer business, and there is likely to be plenty more twists and turns before the window closes next month.",
      "Take a look at all the United news, views and rumours in our dedicated blog below.",
      "Manchester United could be set for a dream final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "United badly needed to fix their goal-scoring issues after netting an abysmal 44 goals in the Premier League last term. Chances were regularly squandered by United's attacking players, who all lacked the composure needed to convert goal-scoring opportunities.",
      "Those problems have been identified and seem to have been partly addressed with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Wolves' Matheus Cunha. And yet a truly top squad needs a reliable goal-scoring No.9, and that's why they are chasing a deal for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Old Trafford or St James' Park? That is the question facing Benjamin Sesko right now.",
      "With just under four weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, the RB Leipzig striker finds himself at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "Both clubs are determined to strengthen their respective forward lines ahead of the September 1 deadline and Sesko has emerged as a leading target for the pair of them.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Mnchester United have been down this road before.",
      "After signing Rasmus Hojlund from Atlanta in the 2023 summer transfer window, United are now trying to sign another young striker in the form of RB Leipzig ace Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United are understood to have submitted an opening offer for the striker worth just under £74million. It is a significant fee for a player that has never scored more than 15 goals in a single season in one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Amorim's recent comments suggest that United have completed thorough checks on Sesko's character before accelerating their interest. It comes after previous claims that the Reds have faced attitude problems, fallouts and dressing room leaks with their squad.",
      "\"It is a key point in our way of doing things now,\" he told club media at United's training base in Chicago.",
      "\"It's not just how they play. It's really important how they play, of course, because that is their job, but their character is really important.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to get to know the players and talk with everybody before we brought players into our group. That is going to be a rule and will be massive in our decision to sign a player.\"",
      "Read more here",
      "David de Gea has issued a five-word message ahead of his impending return to Old Trafford for Fiorentina's pre-season friendly against Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "The Spaniard, 34, departed Old Trafford at the end of his contract back in 2023 - following more than a decade in Manchester. De Gea made a club record 545 appearances as a goalkeeper for United, bagging five major trophies since his arrival in 2011.",
      "But after a challenging 2022/2023 season marked by several high-profile blunders, the United favourite left - with then-head coach Erik ten Hag opting to bring in Andre Onana from Inter Milan as his successor. The goalkeeper endured a tough period post-United, struggling to secure a new club until he signed up with Italian Serie A side Fiorentina last summer.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have reportedly made their move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "And it's clear why so much money is being talked about for such an unproven talent, when you consider just how many attributes he has to succeed in the Premier League. Sesko's pace, power and height are gold dust for English clubs in a market where No.9s who fit that description are, seemingly, so rare.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "According to Calciomercato, United have been offered the opportunity to sign Juventus centre-forward Vlahovic this summer.",
      "The 25-year-old bagged 15 goals in all competitions last season including four in nine Champions League appearances.",
      "However, while the Serb has been offered to the Reds, United look likely to pass up on the opportunity as their focus right now remains on Sesko.",
      "Marcus Rashford scored his first goal for Barcelona during their pre-season friendly against Daegu FC on Monday.",
      "The Manchester United forward's loan move to Camp Nou will see the reigning La Liga champions foot the bill for Rashford's wages during his stint at Camp Nou - a move that is expected to save United around £12million. Barcelona also have the option to make his transfer to Catalonia permanent for a fee of £26m.",
      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season training last month as they stripped him of his iconic No.10 shirt. However, he has now realised his dream move to Barcelona - after spending the latter part of the 2024/2025 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Read more here",
      "Juventus are desperate to part ways with Vlahovic this summer and Tuttosport understands that the concept of reaching a mutual termination of his contract could be considered.",
      "This is because Juve are desperate not to continue paying his £20.8m annual salary as they watch their money.",
      "Should he be released from his contract, United may see Vlahovic as a good alternative to Sesko.",
      "If it is true that Sesko has agreed personal terms with both United and Newcastle, the lower bid from the Reds for the Slovenian could cost them.",
      "Ultimately, neither United nor Newcastle are direct rivals for RB Leipzig this summer and therefore the Bundesliga club will have no preference where he moves.",
      "Their only preference will be to make as much money as possible and thus, Leipzig will be leaning towards Newcastle if they are offering them the most money.",
      "Last month, reports emerged suggesting that Amorim was keen to reunite with Hjulmand this summer to bolster the central midfield.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, United could have an opening there as Juventus, who have been keen on the Dane, are now exploring other options.",
      "Among those being considered are believed to be former United loanee Sofyan Amrabat, Brighton’s Matt O’Riley and Spurs star Yves Bissouma.",
      "If a bid for Sesko has been made, this is great news for United.",
      "It is believed that United were only going to bid for the forward if they felt that Sesko favoured them.",
      "Now news that an offer has been launched is circulating, it suggests that the Slovenian may have made his mind up.",
      "United's bid is believed to be valued at just under £74m.",
      "Currently, it is not known which way Sesko will choose this summer.",
      "According to journalist Florian Plettenberg, Sesko has reached full verbal agreements with United and Newcastle over contracts.",
      "Final details with both clubs were agreed last night according to the Sky Sport Deutschland journalist.",
      "Plettenberg believes it is now down to which club can reach an agreement with Sesko first.",
      "This afternoon, RB Leipzig have provided an update on their squad.",
      "In that, they confirmed that striker Sesko has been training with the club but individually away from the rest of his teammates.",
      "The update comes amid reports that United have launched a bid for Sesko.",
      "Bookmakers Betfair have confirmed they have suspended betting on Sesko's move to United this summer with the Reds now seen as overwhelming favourites to sign him.",
      "Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom explained:",
      "Having been odds-on 8/15 favourites to sign Benjamin Sesko on Monday, betting is now suspended for Man United to seal a deal for the 22-year-old Slovenian. United have already secured deals for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to boost their attacking ranks this summer. With his future looking unlikely, Rasmus Hojlund is 3/10 to join RB Leipzig, heading in the opposite direction to Sesko.",
      "According to BILD, United are making their move for Sesko.",
      "It is understood that the Reds have launched their first formal bid for the Slovenian.",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein understands the bid is valued at £65m plus £8.7m in add-ons.",
      "United are far from done this summer. We know they want a new centre-forward, with Benjamin Sesko of interest, but what other deals could they complete before the window closes?",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is a prime candidate for an exit and bookmakers Bet365 rate him as a 9/4 chance to stay at the Reds this summer with Chelsea the 4/11 favourites to sign the Argentina international.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle are the 1/2 odds-on favourites to sign Sesko with United still a short 6/4 to complete his signature.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's situation is an interesting one. He could be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer and United are 9/4 to sign him. If United do not sign either Sesko or Jackson this summer, Ollie Watkins is an option and he's 4/1 to sign from Aston Villa.",
      "Other strikers the Reds could sign include free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin (5/1), and Christopher Nkunku (8/1).",
      "Elsewhere, Bet365 are offering odds on goalkeepers Emiliano Martinez (7/4) and Gianluigi Donnarumma (7/2) to sign for United.",

      "It is claimed they are now offering Leipzig £69.7m plus add-ons to bring the forward to St James' Park.",

      "We are going to kick things off by looking at this man and the latest on his future...",
      "According to The Athletic, Chelsea are in informal talks with United over Alejandro Garnacho. The 21-year-old winger has faced an uncertain future at Old Trafford for a while now after falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The report also claims that Real Betis want to sign Antony on a permanent basis after his successful loan spell in La Liga last season, but talks haven't entered the 'advanced' stages yet. It's said that United hope to offload Jadon Sancho and they're open to offers for Tyrell Malacia.",
      "The report claims United want a 'clear indication' that Sesko wants to join before submitting a formal bid. It's said that Ruben Amorim's side have already explored the conditions for other strikers, including Ollie Watkins.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Chelsea have offered United, Newcastle and AC Milan the chance to sign Nicolas Jackson this summer. The report claims that the Blues are open to selling the 24-year-old striker for the 'right price, which is believed to be £80m.",
      "It's said that Chelsea could also be opening to loaning Jackson, but would likely want an obligation to buy clause inserted into the deal. talkSPORT reckon that several clubs are keen on the Senegal international, with the west Londoners set to field approaches.",
      "According to The Mirror, Aston Villa are prepared to sell Ollie Watkins to fund a bid for Nicolas Jackson. The report claims that Unai Emery wants to be reunited with the Chelsea striker.",
      "The former Arsenal boss closely worked with Jackson at Villarreal before he left for Villa Park – just nine months before the west Londoners signed him for just £32m.",
      "It's said that the west Londoners have been holding out for an £80m fee for the 24-year-old, who recently signed an eight-year contract. So, in order to sign Jackson, Villa would have to cash in on Watkins, who's on United's radar...",
      "United have been offered the chance to sign Dusan Vlahovic, according to Fabrizio Romano. Speaking on his on his YouTube channel, the journalist said: \"United, in the last three days, Saturday, Sunday, Monday morning, have been offered the possibility to sign Dusan Vlahovic again.",
      "\"Vlahovic is out of Juventus project, Vlahovic is a player who can leave Juventus for a good proposal, and he’s been offered to Manchester United again. Something like, 'okay, if you can’t get a deal done for Sesko, Vlahovic is an opportunity'.",
      "\"He’s raised on the table, but Manchester United’s reply during all three days was, 'we are focused on Sesko, we want to go for Sesko, we are still in for Sesko'. So United are waiting for that story as a priority.\"",
      "Romano added: \"Then, if Sesko will decide to go to Newcastle… I told you several times, in that case, maybe United will consider different options for the new striker. But at the moment, [no] was the answer to Vlahovic.\"",
      "Omar Berrada has insisted club officials are working hard to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad this summer. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the United CEO said: \"We have to do a lot of multi-tasking.",
      "\"We have a team back home led by (director of football) Jason (Wilcox), the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad.",
      "\"There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it. What we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",
      "\"Of course, adding players helps. We have seen the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon...\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes has urged United to sign a couple of new players before the summer transfer window slams shut. Speaking to reporters following the Reds' draw with Everton, the 30-year-old midfielder said: \"I don’t want to take a dig at anyone.",
      "\"I think that the club is doing the best that they can. In terms obviously of all the financial situation that they talk about, I don’t know about it. It was crystal clear that we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "\"We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, to have more to do to get into the first eleven.",
      "\"I think that’s what the club is trying to do, the manager, and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "According to TeamTalk, Gianluigi Donnarumma is interested in joining United. The 26-year-old goalkeeper faces an uncertain future at Paris Saint-Germain, having recently entered the final year of his contract in the French capital.",
      "The report claims that United have been asked to stay informed on Donnarumma's situation, with the club viewing him as a 'serious target'. It's said that the Italy international is 'highly regarded' officials at Old Trafford, with his profile considered 'impressive'.",
      "TeamTalk reckon that the Reds have formally registered their interest and they're monitoring developments...",
      "The report claims that the Magpies have offered the Bundesliga outfit a fixed fee worth £69.7m (€80m), plus add-ons. It's said that Newcastle first bid £65.3m (€75m), plus £4.4m (€5m) in bonuses, before opening talks over the structure of a deal.",
      "Benjamin Sesko continues to be heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford, meanwhile, Gianluigi Donnarumma has recently emerged as a potential target. There's a lot of work to be done before United host Arsenal on Sunday, August 17, so Jason Wilcox will be under pressure to deliver..."

      "United's tour of the US consisted of three games, two wins, one draw and eight goals. Their performances in the wins over West Ham United and Bournemouth were particularly impressive.",
      "With just one friendly to go - a clash with Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime - head coach Ruben Amorim will potentially use his side's final warm up match to get a good look at the starting XI he plans to unleash for the season opener against Arsenal in just under a fortnight's time.",
      "Over the course of United's opening four pre-season friendlies, the first of which was a goalless draw against Leeds United in Stockholm last month, Amorim made 18 changes to his starting XI, ensuring he got the opportunity to get as close a look as possible at the members of his squad.",
      "However, Amorim has not tested the water with many midfield combinations this summer, starting just two different central-midfield partnerships. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro started side by side against Leeds and Bournemouth, while Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte got the nod against West Ham and Everton.",
      "Against the Hammers, Mainoo and Ugarte were excellent, producing performances that would not have looked out of place in a competitive fixture. United set an excellent tempo and the pair of them were drivers of it.",
      "Against Everton, though, United were sloppy in the engine room. They struggled against the Toffees' physicality levels and Ugarte was guilty of giving the ball away far too cheaply for Iliman Ndiaye's first half equaliser.",
      "Concerns about Ugarte's ability on the ball have regularly been expressed in recent months amid United's desire to sign a new midfielder this summer. As solid as he is defensively, his ability on the ball holds him back.",
      "Mainoo, whose long-term position under Amorim remains undecided, has looked at home as a No.8 for the majority of pre-season, playing forward-thinking passes and offering United a degree of energy.",
      "However, the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha mean they are leading candidates to start the season as the two No.10s, meaning Fernandes, despite starting two games as one of the playmakers, is expected to make a permanent switch to midfield.",
      "If that expectation transpires, it is currently a wide open race to partner him in the engine room. Casemiro has been his midfield partner in the two games he has started deeper this summer, but the Brazilian is not guaranteed to remain a regular starter once the competitive action kicks off.",
      "Many United supporters believe Mainoo should, one way or another, be in Amorim's first-choice starting XI, ensuring the Portuguese head coach finds a way to make full use of his talent. However, the fact he and Fernandes have not played alongside each other in midfield at any point so far this pre-season suggests Amorim is not thinking about unleashing them as a midfield duo.",
      "Amid the debate that is going on about who will form United's strongest midfield partnership this season, concerns have understandably been raised about how little bite and defensive nous a duo of Mainoo and Fernandes would have.",
      "Both players are renowned for being forward-thinking, and Fernandes will be expected to take up attacking positions, leaving Mainoo potentially exposed.",
      "United need to source a new midfielder ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1, and they are expected to do so amid the likelihood of Toby Collyer being allowed to leave on loan.",
      "In an ideal world, United need a midfielder who is aggressive, good on the ball and defensively sound. However, ticking all of those boxes will come at a price.",
      "But having refused to unleash Fernandes and Mainoo as a paring so far this pre-season, it feels somewhat unlikely Amorim will turn to them come the start of the competitive action.",

Benjamin Sesko is the new priority target, yet with Newcastle also keen to secure his signature, bringing him to Old Trafford is not going to be easy.",

      "Matheus Cunha was trialled as a false nine against Everton on Sunday, and the £62.5million signing connected well in the move that led to United winning a first-half penalty. However, the former Wolves man was clearly eager to drop deep and get involved in play, leaving United without a focal point.",
      "The experiment didn't work and only further highlighted United's desperate need for a centre forward.",

      "Had the Cunha experiment worked, would they have been tempted to suggest not signing a striker wouldn't be the end of the world given the existing options available to them? It's impossible to say, and there's no indication to suggest they would have done. But as good a player as Cunha is, he will never be the answer to their problems up top.",

      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, the ex-Red Devils keeper said: \"If he goes to Newcastle, the Champions League is a massive draw, but he's got some big boots to fill there with Isak. As a striker, I don't know if you necessarily need that kind of excess pressure as well.",

      "After replacing Robert Lewandowski at half-time, Rashford scored his first goal in Barcelona colours with 25 minutes left on the clock, converting a low cross from inside the penalty area to score his side's fifth goal of the game.",
      "He was tasked with spearheading the La Liga champions' attack in the second half, whereas his two previous appearances since joining the club had seen him operate on the left flank.",
      "The United academy graduate has frequently reiterated throughout his career that he prefers to play on the left-wing. His best performances in a United shirt have often come from out wide, with the England international regularly cutting inside onto his right foot.",

      "\"He can play at No.9 or No.11,\" said Flick. \"We changed it because we had to be careful with Ferran.",
      "\"We wanted to see how he adapted to the position.\"",

      "Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Dusan Vlahovic as an alternative to Benjamin Sesko. The RB Leipzig striker has recently been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but Ruben Amorim faces tough competition for his signature.",
      "It's said that Eddie Howe's side are currently in talks with the Bundesliga outfit over the structure of a potential deal. United are also in contact with Leipzig as Amorim looks to bolster his attacking options before the transfer window slams shut.",
      "The Reds are reportedly expected to make a formal offer for Sesko, who is said to be open to both projects. Leipzig are said to be interested in signing Rasmus Hojlund, and they've already explored the conditions of a loan as part of any possible move for their talisman.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "United may be well positioned to hijack Newcastle's pursuit of the Slovenia international, but they're yet to submit a bid. With the Reds seemingly reluctant to meet Sesko's price tag, they've been offered the chance to sign Vlahovic, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The 25-year-old striker faces an uncertain future at Juventus, having recently entered the final year of his contract. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the journalist said: \"Manchester United, in the last three days, Saturday, Sunday, Monday morning, have been offered the possibility to sign Dusan Vlahovic again.",
      "\"Vlahovic is out of Juventus project, Vlahovic is a player who can leave Juventus for a good proposal, and he’s been offered to Manchester United again. Something like, 'okay, if you can’t get a deal done for Sesko, Vlahovic is an opportunity'.",
      "\"He’s raised on the table, but Manchester United’s reply during all three days was, 'we are focused on Sesko, we want to go for Sesko, we are still in for Sesko'. So United are waiting for that story as a priority.\"",
      "Romano added: \"Then, if Sesko will decide to go to Newcastle… I told you several times, in that case, maybe United will consider different options for the new striker. But at the moment, [no] was the answer to Vlahovic.\"",
      "Vlahovic, who will be a free agent next summer, featured 29 times in the Serie A last season, scoring 10 goals and providing four assists. The Serbia international played a key role in the side before picking up a couple of knocks over the festive period.",
      "Shortly after replacing Thiago Motta as the new Juventus head coach, Igor Tudor provided a glowing assessment of Vlahovic. Speaking to the Italian press in March, as quoted by TMW, the Croatian manager said: \"He’s a very strong player and I’m happy to coach him.",
      "\"I’ve already spoken about him in the past, these are facts, not just words. He’s a player who has all the skills that a top-class player needs to have. He knows how to score goals, he understands, he’s intelligent, a motivator.\"",
      "The Juventus boss added: \"He’s coming off this moment, we’ve talked, we’ve exchanged opinions. He wants to work. We have him and [Randal] Kolo [Muani], who are both strong players.\"",
      "When asked if the duo can play together in the same team, Tudor replied: \"They can play together, one or the other, we can do everything. It’s important to have strong players, otherwise a coach can’t do anything.\"",
      "Transfermarkt currently value Vlahovic at £30.5m (€35m), which is a fraction of the fee that Leipzig reportedly want for Sesko.",

      "And in the opinion of Maguire, who has started just one of United's first four pre-season friendlies this summer, the amount of time they will have to prepare for league fixtures must ensure they are ready to attack each and every challenge head-on.",

      "After a long, drawn out negotiation saga between Brentford and United, the Reds finally got their man just a day before they flew out to America for the Premier League Summer Series. Having not been in training from the beginning of July like his teammates, Mbeumo was given a cautious introduction to the first-team.",
      "Ruben Amorim did not select him for the victories over West Ham and Bournemouth but introduced him from the start alongside Matheus Cunha up front for the draw against Everton. The 25-year-old was replaced at half-time but will be hopeful that he can play further minutes in the Reds' final pre-season fixture against Fiorentina on Saturday.",
      "Despite his limited game time, Mbeumo reflected positively on the tour, posting on Instagram: \"US Tour done. Happy to have made my debut with the team.",
      "\"Thanks fans for the massive support.\" Among those to reply were his former Brentford teammate Ivan Toney who wrote: \"Let’s go my son,\" while Diogo Dalot replied: \"Allezzzz Bryan.\"",
      "However, it was Fernandes who made a confident prediction for his new teammate, as he wrote: \"First of many.\" Exactly how Amorim will utilise Mbeumo moving forward remains to be seen.",
      "The Portuguese head coach could choose to play him alongside another centre-forward up top like Cunha or Rasmus Hojlund, or he may play deeper in one of the No.10 positions instead. We should get a clearer idea of Amorim's plans Saturday at Old Trafford.",

      "20) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in the agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "19) Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Jeremy Jacquet – Rennes to Arsenal\nAnother defender, Mikel? That’s insane. Arsenal’s interest in Jacquet will only be accelarated should Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior leave. The latter is attracting interest from all over Europe, but Arteta wants to keep him. Arsenal even rejected an offer from Portugal earlier this summer for the Pole, who’s destined for a place on this rumour ranking very, very soon. A fresh report has suggested Arsenal could sign Jacquet and loan him back to Rennes, William Saliba style. This rumour just became more realistic…",
      "",
      "17) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Let’s see who blinks first…",
      "",

Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £50m and expected to move due to his lack of desire to sign an extension. Guehi has also been linked with Liverpool, who could continue their assault on the Magpies by hijacking the deal…",

The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave.

      "",
      "12) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin recently in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "11) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal has dropped down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",

But another piece in their Isak puzzle could fall into place thanks to the Magpies’ owners. PIF want to give the Saudi Pro League runners-up a shiny new centre-forward and Nunez has been earmarked as that man, with the Uruguayan described as ‘receptive’ to that interest ahead of bidding.",
      "",
      "7) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nLast Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by that evening, it was Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? We doubt it, even with a substantial offer made. Reports suggested that United wouldn’t bid for Sesko until they had his word that he wants them, not Newcastle, which hints towards a move to Old Trafford for the 22-year-old.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly turned down the chance to sell Harry Maguire this summer and instead want him to sign a new contract.",
      "Maguire has been a much-maligned figure at Old Trafford since his £80million move from Leicester City in 2019.",
      "He became the most expensive defender in the world at the time – a title he still holds – with Manchester City’s £77m signing of Josko Gvardiol two years ago the closest contender.",
      "Maguire has made 246 appearances for United over the last six years, winning the Carabao Cup as club captain in 2023 and the FA Cup in 2024.",
      "He wore the armband from 2019 to 2023, having been handed the role by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer before Erik ten Hag passed it on to Bruno Fernandes in July 2023.",
      "The 32-year-old’s performances have often been heavily scrutinised, and United have looked to move him on in recent transfer windows. However, new(ish) co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and head coach Ruben Amorim clearly rate him highly.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, they are both such big fans that United want to give Maguire a new contract so he can ‘see out his career at Old Trafford’.",
      "This decision has been made despite strong interest in the defender, the report from Mike Keegan says.",
      "Indeed, the Premier League giants – who have signed four first-team players so far this summer – have ‘rebuffed approaches from clubs in England and abroad’.",
      "There are ‘a number of interested parties’, with three Premier League sides and two from Italy ‘exploring a move’ for Maguire, only to be ‘turned away’.",
      "The interested clubs have been informed that ‘the likelihood is that the England defender is likely to extend his contract – and spend the rest of his career at Old Trafford’.",
      "Maguire’s £190,000-a-week contract expires at the end of 2025/26, but the player ‘is keen to stay’ as he ‘desires emulating the likes of Denis Irwin, Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson as key United mainstays’.",
      "There have been no talks over an extension yet, but United are sending out the message that they want to keep him.",
      "If no agreement can be reached, Maguire ‘is unlikely to be short of options’ and is ‘aware of the stunning season former team-mate Scott McTominay’ at Napoli. Presumably because he doesn’t live under a rock.",
      "The Turkish big three, Besiktas, Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, are among Maguire’s ‘admirers’, while French clubs AS Monaco and Marseille ‘are monitoring the situation’. Besiktas and Fenerbahce are both managed by ex-United bosses Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho, respectively.",
      "There’s no mention of the proposed new deal including a wage cut or performance-related incentives, and any extension appears to be nowhere near agreed.",
      "As Maguire’s contract enters its final year, clubs abroad can begin negotiating a pre-contract agreement from January 1, assuming he doesn’t commit to new terms before then.",
      "READ NEXT: ‘Selling club’ is not a slur and teams shouldn’t fear it – Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City don’t",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Florian Wirtz is set to become the Premier League’s most expensive signing but how have his predecessors fared?",
      "Man Utd hero Patrice Evra has hit out at the Red Devils fans over their “disgusting” treatment of one player as Amorim claims his side “choke in every game”.",
      "A former head of the PGMOL has ‘demanded a rule change’ after one moment in Manchester United’s 1-0 loss to Chelsea on Friday night.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists that he must give his players “the feeling that we cannot lose a match” rather than look to new signings in the summer.",
      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire."

Budget permitting, Newcastle could bring in the Portugal international alongside Sesko or Yoane Wissa, their other priority target. Should Howe manage to get Isak’s head straight and convince him to stay for another season, Ramos could also be signed as a replacement for Callum Wilson.’",

      "Clubs and fans seem terrified of the ‘selling club’ branding that everyone bar Real Madrid should embrace. Spurs and Newcastle must be more Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Modern football fandom is beset with two-word comebacks that should really go directly in the bin.",
      "Lazy, tribal, point-scoring shitpost retorts to shitpost statements. ‘Warra trophy’. ‘Cry more’. ‘Rent free’.",
      "But there’s one two-word sobriquet that most clubs themselves appear to fear above all others, when in reality it belongs in the same social-media bonfire as the rest.",
      "‘Selling club’.",
      "It is a desperate moniker to become saddled with, a slur almost impossible to shake once it has taken hold. It’s one that speaks to so many of football’s wider talking points: of profit above glory; of placing more emphasis on the balance sheet than the league table; of, at the most basic level, a lack of ambition.",
      "But there is something else very important about it, and that is the fact it is complete and utter and total bollocks. There is an utter bereft hollow meaninglessness at the core of the jet-black soul of ‘Selling Club’.",
      "Because do you know which clubs are selling clubs? Almost all of them. And with the possible exception of Real Madrid, for any club that is not a ‘selling club’ at this time it is down to either rank incompetence or not for the want of trying.",
      "Manchester United have spent much of the summer desperately trying to be a selling club. Tottenham and Arsenal both historically suck at the art of selling players.",
      "With Spurs they either sell players long after the need has become obvious, or grudgingly unwillingly let star names go at the peak of their value but in such a way that no useful reinvestment of that windfall can ever follow.",
      "Arsenal are simply incapable of selling players at all. At least, not for any meaningful value. The £22m they received from Real Madrid for Nicolas Anelka 25 years ago remains one of their biggest ever player sales, and that’s just plain nutty.",
      "Against these you have Liverpool and Manchester City, who are just much better at it. Liverpool will not have entered this summer thinking “WE SIMPLY MUST SELL LUIS DIAZ” but at the same time knew there was a price that was worth selling him at, and when someone offered it they accepted.",
      "And it’s not an isolated case. Unlike Arsenal or Spurs, they are happy enough to cash in on even talented homegrown players when the right offer comes along. Our gut feel is that if Jarell Quansah was at Spurs or Arsenal, they would not have sold him for £30m.",
      "But that readiness and willingness to trade in the market is a big factor in why Liverpool have been able to spend as they have this summer.",
      "The way in which they reaped the benefits of selling Philippe Coutinho for the very daftest of money has entered football legend, and those benefits continue to be felt to this day.",
      "Man City operate similarly. They spend plenty, but they are better than most at recouping it as well. There are inevitably mistakes along the way with this approach. Cole Palmer, for instance. But who can really argue with City’s decision to move on Raheem Sterling or Ferran Torres or Gabriel Jesus or Leroy Sane at prices around the £50m mark.",
      "Even though selling Julian Alvarez for around £70m left them short at times last season, it’s hard to argue that wasn’t reasonable business for an understudy.",
      "But again, it’s simply not a deal one can imagine Spurs or Arsenal or Man United pulling off at this time.",
      "A shrewder club than Spurs might, for instance, have considered cashing in on Brennan Johnson this summer. His stock is high after scoring the winning goal in Bilbao, and he is a player who catches the eye because he is very, very good at one particular thing: arriving late and finding space in the penalty area to score from close-range when his opposite number or full-back puts a cross into the box.",
      "It’s certainly a very useful skill to have, and in the right team is absolutely deadly. He is also really quite average at almost everything else. There were many potential ways to upgrade there for minimal or even no financial outlay.",
      "But it’s simply not the way Spurs operate. Always the most painfully self-aware of the fragility of their ‘Big Six’ status, Spurs are perhaps more afeared than anyone of selling any player who might still have some value. Instead they end up with a stockpile that leaves them quite unable to name an even halfway coherent Champions League squad and a logjam for incomings as well thanks to a squad that pulls off the trick of being both bloated yet desperately lacking in so many key areas.",
      "While there are some teams who are good at selling and some that are bad, there needs to be a separate category altogether for Chelsea. We are grudgingly and confusedly coming round to the view that their objectively insane transfer strategy might just be the most correct one for an insane world.",
      "Theirs is not necessarily a route open to other clubs in the way the City and Liverpool blueprints are. And Chelsea have always been pretty handy at this even in the Abramovich days. But under Clearlake they have leaned into it so successfully that even their stupidest signings end up stupid like a fox.",
      "Spent over £30m on Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for some reason? Don’t worry, Everton will make sure you wipe your feet.",
      "Overspent on Joao Felix even after watching him go through a deeply unimpressive loan spell with absolutely no obvious reason to expect anything different on a permanent basis? Here comes the Saudi gravy train.",
      "Burnley are going to give them £20m for Armando Broja as well as a similar amount for Lesley Ugochukwu and £14m for Bashir Humphreys.",
      "And it’s not just teams lower down the foodchain who very much enjoy handing Chelsea vast sums of money. Arsenal simply cannot get enough of handing Chelsea vast sums of money.",
      "We’re not saying there’s anything particularly admirable about Chelsea’s vast football player megamart where players are bought and sold for absurd fees and daft contracts, but there’s something extraordinary about their ability to make their successes vast and even their failures, at worst, not that costly.",
      "Someone, somewhere will, over the weeks ahead, cough up £80m for Nicolas Jackson. And you have to say that’s magnificent.",
      "As Spurs make announcements about Radu Dragusin that declare their fifth-choice centre-back will be wearing the number three shirt next season, other clubs are actually selling these players and getting something for them. Like Vinted but for billionaires.",
      "Newcastle are told time and again they must not sell Alexander Isak because it would make them a ‘selling club’. But that’s only true if they don’t actually spend that money on improving the team and the squad.",
      "Because the boring reality behind the ‘selling club’ slur is that what you’re actually describing is a trading club.",
      "And that is what almost all football clubs are, or should strive to be. It was always true, but never more so than now with PSR and squad limits ready to hurt those who can’t get this right."

      "After taking well over a month to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United are continuing their one-iron-in-the-transfer-fire approach by putting all of their efforts into signing a new No.9 this summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the man they want and we can safely assume a first formal bid – if and when it arrives – will fall short of the mark, like the second formal bid, and maybe even a third, before Sir Jim Ratcliffe holds his hands up and pays the piper.",
      "Either that or Sesko chooses Newcastle, which will be absolutely fine by Ruben Amorim, who has become perhaps the greatest-ever purveyor of the This Is Manchester United call to arms, despite being – or perhaps because he is – the worst Manchester United manager in the Premier League era.",
      "After a harrowing first season and with so-called ‘bad eggs’ either moving to Barcelona or currently training away from the rest of the squad while seeking an exit, Amorim has set his sights on footballers with a genuine love for Manchester United.",
      "By all accounts he’s found that deep-seated adoration in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, to whom he offered telling, on-brand advice before they decided to make their dream moves.",
      "“In the meetings with Bryan, with Cunha, we said that. Don’t go to a club because of the manager. Go because of the idea of the club. And they are here because of the idea of the club.”",
      "It’s a non-negotiable he’s stayed true to throughout the transfer window having made the vow before the end of last season when asked about a possible approach for Viktor Gyokeres: “We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "It’s a requirement of any aspiring United player which nearly cost Amorim the signing of Mbeumo, and may well have resulted in the club paying over the odds for the 25-year-old, with Brentford not at all happy that they approached him before them.",
      "But with innumerable post-Sir Alex Ferguson signings seeing a move to Old Trafford as a means to a hefty pay cheque and as their final destination in the worst possible ‘f*** it, I’ve made it’ sort of way, bringing about a whole club malaise that’s seen them plumb extraordinarily low depths, Amorim has quite rightly identified hunger as the key trait in new signings beyond them being excellent at football. If only it didn’t then take so bleeding long to sign them.",
      "We’re aware that a football club that “would have been bust by Christmas” had it not been for the lunch-denying, ticket price-increasing, redundancy king isn’t flush enough to be making offers for multiple players in multiple positions at the same time, but this linear approach to a transfer window has already cost Amorim the chance of a pre-season with a new striker, and threatens to leave him without another much-needed addition when the season starts in less than two weeks.",
      "They clearly have and have had the funds to sign all of Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Sesko, so why not look to sign them at the same time rather than waiting for one to be confirmed before moving onto the next? It’s like a toddler eating a meal from highest-value item to lowest. Don’t forget the central midfield broccoli, guys.",
      "Omar Berrada promised in June to “do our best to do more signings quickly”, adding that “when you’re not quick it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money”.",
      "So far they’ve met Cunha’s £62.5m release clause, took 44 days between first contact with Mbeumo and paying Brentford £17m over his market value to sign him, and are currently waiting to either pay the €80m Leipzig want on the terms they set for Sesko or walking away from a deal for a player who’s certainly now the club’s top target if not necessarily Amorim’s – he’s keen on Ollie Watkins – before presumably making a late-window dash to sign a central midfielder.",
      "Because let’s be absolutely clear – Amorim really needs a new central midfielder. He’s walking into a season knowing that none of his current possible pairings will work. Fabrizio Romano has revealed they dropped their not-so-secret interest in Joao Palhinha as Amorim decided he wanted a “less holding defensive midfielder – still defensive but with more intensity in their vision”.",
      "They don’t have that guy, and although they’ve been linked with Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand and Valencia’s Javi Guerra while ignoring the midfielder Romano is essentially describing there in Douglas Luiz, judging by the strategy of the transfer window thus far, United won’t even have made contact with a preferred option, let alone asked for the requisite pictures of them in a Cristiano Ronaldo shirt as a ten-year-old before initiating club-to-club talks.",
      "Amorim is to blame for the Sesko hold-up in so much as United are waiting for the striker to ‘commit’ to them over Newcastle before making a bid. But that in no way stops his bosses from multi-tasking. A lack of funds may do, but amid claims throughout the window that United must sell before they buy, they’ve sold precisely no-one and yet are prepared to take their spending to well over £200m if they get the green light from Sesko.",
      "The transfer window will be a success if United sign a striker and midfielder thanks to Amorim’s hard-and-fast rule on those new signings, but the start to his second season has been hamstrung by the club’s apparent inability to negotiate two signings at the same time.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has hatched a plan to ‘expose’ his ‘lazy’ Manchester United players during the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed what was said to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in transfer talks to help Manchester United beat Newcastle to signing them.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is reportedly excited at the prospect of Benjamin Sesko joining with the Red Devils ‘very optimistic’ a deal will get done.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s ‘spending is to continue’ after landing Benjamin Sesko as they will turn their attention to a new top target.",
      "Man Utd fans may have to settle for another year of Rasmus Hojlund up top after Ruben Amorim suggested he was happy with the Dane leading the line.",
      "The Manchester United push to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle is not being ‘driven’ by Ruben Amorim, who ‘prefers’ an alternative."

      "Jackson is said to be ‘high’ among the options for clubs in the Premier League and Europe due to his ‘suitability and availability’, while he is ‘at risk of not being the primary forward and will want to be the main man somewhere’.",

      "“But Man Utd’s reply during the whole three days was: ‘We are focused on Sesko, we want to go for Sesko, we are still in for Sesko.’ So, United are waiting for that story as a priority.”",
      "Transfer journalist Ben Jacobs has claimed that Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson could be an option still after Man Utd were also “offered” the Senegal international.",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: “Chelsea’s position on Nicolas Jackson has always been a sale is possible at the right price, even though he remains valued by Enzo Maresca.",
      "“A lot will also come down to Jackson and whether he wants to be a lead striker elsewhere. Liam Delap has arrived, and fellow new signing Joao Pedro would be used more as a No.9 if Xavi Simons is added, potentially reducing Jackson’s game time.",

      "Every summer, the likes of Fabrizio Romano, Florian Plettenberg and Gianluca Di Marzio declare that one transfer could trigger a ‘domino effect’. It never does. And yet, we delude ourselves into thinking it might.",
      "But…this summer, it just might.",
      "The potential domino effect doesn’t simply surround signing replacements, but also raising the funds to go out and sign a top target. That’s a strong factor this summer, anyway.",
      "With everything taken into account, we’ve predicted what will happen in the striker market before the 2025 summer transfer window closes. Here are ten different dominos set to fall this month.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko to Newcastle United\nThere’s only one deal that can truly get the ball rolling, and that’s Sesko to Newcastle United.",
      "The RB Leipzig and Slovenia striker was under consideration at Arsenal before they swerved toward the Viktor Gyokeres lane, going all in on signing him after deeming Leipzig’s demands for Sesko too steep.",
      "It’s reported that the Bundesliga club want a guaranteed £65million, some add-ons, and a percentage of a future sale.",
      "Newcastle thought they’d have an opening bid worth £65m + £4m in add-ons accepted, but David Ornstein says it has been deemed ‘insufficient’ over in Germany. The add-ons weren’t enough, or maybe it was the lack of a future fee guarantee – we’re not entirely sure.",
      "Either way, the Magpies need to return with another offer, or Manchester United could swoop in. They have no intention of selling Alexander Isak before having a replacement sorted, so unless Liverpool cough up £150m over the next few days, we can’t see that transfer being the one that triggers the domino.",
      "The Red Devils are still in the picture but haven’t made a bid for Sesko…yet. If they get an indication that the 22-year-old prefers them to Newcastle, they’ll probably sign him. They need to sell but could get Sesko and work that out later, with Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all available for transfer.",
      "In an ideal world for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, they’ll bring in around £100m and significantly reduce the wage bill in the process.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak to Liverpool\nAssuming Sesko to Newcastle is the first domino to fall, the door will be firmly open for Isak to complete a dream move to Anfield.",
      "The Premier League champions remain in a strong financial position despite already spending £263m. They’ve been sensible enough in the transfer market over the years to enable such an expensive outlay, and recently sold Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich for £65m and Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.",
      "Newcastle signing Sesko doesn’t completely force their hand when it comes to selling Isak either; they’ve always wanted to sign another striker this summer and are still working on a deal to sign Brentford’s Yoane Wissa.",
      "Isak didn’t travel to Asia for the Magpies’ pre-season tour and has burned some bridges with the club’s fanbase through his attempts to force a move to Liverpool. Many don’t want to see him don the black and white stripes again, while others accept the situation and would do anything for their elite centre-forward to stay ahead of a Champions League campaign.",
      "That’s extremely unlikely, and Isak’s move to Liverpool feels like a case of when, not if.",
      "MORE ON ISAK TO LIVERPOOL\n👉 Liverpool ‘have played a blinder’ over Isak to ‘gazump’ Newcastle ‘no matter what’\n👉 £150m Alexander Isak would *actually* be the ninth most expensive Premier League player ever\n👉 Liverpool swap for Isak worth a ‘bash’ thanks to Eddie Howe and Newcastle failsafe",
      "",
      "8) Darwin Nunez to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool want to sell Nunez no matter what. Clubs in Italy have been strongly linked throughout the summer, but it looks like Captain Chaos is off to the Middle East.",
      "You can put this transfer second or third on this ranking. If he’s sold before Isak is signed, then the Reds are even more equipped to pay a British record fee. If Isak is signed first, the Reds’ stance on Nunez doesn’t change: he’s still set for the exit door.",
      "We’ll miss Nunez and his unpredictable nature, but a summer transfer is the right thing for everyone. It remains to be seen if he’s fully on board with a switch to Saudi, but he knows there’s no place for him in Arne Slot’s squad anymore – especially if Isak joins.",
      "",
      "7) Ollie Watkins to Manchester United\nUnited have narrowed down their striker shortlist to two completely different players: Watkins and Sesko. The former loves getting in behind and does most of his business in and around the 18-yard box, while Sesko drops deep and takes long-range shots.",
      "Is that what United need? Not really. Is that what United have prioritised over the experienced Watkins? Of course it is.",
      "If Sesko joins Newcastle, United – assuming Ruben Amorim has any say in striker recruitment – will surely turn their attention to Watkins. And at 29, there are reservations over Watkins’ resale value. United really shouldn’t care about that. When was the last time they sold someone for a profit? Not counting academy players, it was Alvaro Carreras, and they still managed to mess that up spectacularly.",
      "Just forget about that and get an outstanding centre-forward through the bloody door.",
      "Missing out on Sesko will surely reignite United’s interest in the Aston Villa star, and despite being reluctant to lose him, Unai Emery’s side should sanction a sale for £40-50m. And if he joins the Red Devils, they’ll be even more desperate to offload their unwanted players.",
      "",
      "6) Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea\nOne of those unwanted players is Garnacho, who Chelsea want to sign because Chelsea want to sign all of the players.",
      "Does paying £50m for the 21-year-old make sense when Tyrique George is Right There? And £50m has already been spent on Jamie Gittens this summer? Oh, and Mykhaylo Mudryk exists even without a shirt number. He’s suspended but is still there and could return tomorrow, in two months, or four years. Nobody knows.",
      "Simply put, Chelsea don’t need Garnacho.",
      "The overriding point is that Chelsea will always be Chelsea, and their unrelenting desire to sign players means they’re convinced Garnacho can become one of the best wingers in the world. Just as they were with Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Estevao and Angelo. They are deluded, but integral to the transfer domino, with interest in Garnacho completely separate from their Xavi Simons pursuit.",
      "",
      "5) Christopher Nkunku to Manchester United\nThe Blues’ transfer addiction means players who don’t do very, very well are on the chopping block. It’s a revolving door at Stamford Bridge. Their next signing will be their 50th over the last four years. Manchester United, who are chronically addicted to trying to make things right in the transfer window, bought Ander Herrera 49 signings ago.",
      "Nkunku has been expected to leave Chelsea for a while, but he’s still at the club and still played in this summer’s Club World Cup, scoring once. Efforts to offload the Frenchman will ramp up when Simons or Garnacho are signed, and we can see him following Watkins to Old Trafford.",
      "Swap deals almost never happen, and PSR means they’re a bad idea, so the Garnacho and Nkunku deals will be separate. And the latter’s move to United will open the door for another Old Trafford exit…",
      "",
      "4) Rasmus Hojlund to Juventus\n“I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay at Manchester United. I want to fight for my spot whatever happens,” said Hojlund last week. But the transfer domino effect has spoken.",
      "Leipzig are interested in making Hojlund part of the Sesko deal, and the Dane is also an option for AC Milan, while Juventus have been linked and want a striker as well.",
      "Having done well for Atalanta in Serie A, Hojlund could open the door for a return, and it doesn’t come much bigger than Juve in Italy.",
      "",
      "3) Dusan Vlahovic to AC Milan\nAnd if Juventus sign Hojlund, there’s no doubt that Vlahovic will move on. The Old Lady are reportedly keen to offload the former Arsenal target and are also working on a deal for Randal Kolo Muani, who is tangentially involved in the domino.",
      "But Hojlund’s move, coupled with Nunez going to Al-Hilal, means Milan’s striker shortlist will be down to Stade Rennais’ Arnaud Kalimuendo and Vlahovic. For pure convenience, we’re saying the Juve man makes the move to San Siro.",
      "",
      "2) Arnaud Kalimuendo to Brentford\nIt’s awfully convenient, as it opens the door for Brentford to sign Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "The Bees have been linked with the Frenchman and Arsenal’s Leandro Trossard, but the former is a natural centre-forward and exactly what they need as Wissa does everything in his power to leave.",
      "Wissa is refusing to train and will leave Brentford under acrimonious circumstances, having been promised a £26m transfer this summer after pledging his future to the club last year. After losing Man United signing Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford’s stance changed, and Wissa is very, very upset.",
      "Clearly having some level of understanding and sympathy for a player who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, Brentford aren’t sitting still and have identified Kalimuendo as a potential signing. He won’t come cheap, but Keith Andrews needs some real quality in his team after selling Mbeumo and Christian Nørgaard.",
      "",
      "1) Yoane Wissa to Newcastle\nThe transfer domino starts and finishes at St James’ Park, as Wissa finally finds his way to the northeast after Brentford sign Milan target Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "Poor Aston Villa are left in the dust without a Watkins replacement because ten is the magic number. An honourable mention for Kolo Muani here will suffice.",
      "As mentioned before, the plan has always been for Eddie Howe to receive a new striker to play with Isak, and that could happen with Wissa or Sesko joining and their star player staying, or with Wissa playing alongside Sesko in 2025/26.",
      "Despite all the aggro surrounding Wissa’s situation, we think he’ll get his Magpies move. Whether it comes after these nine deals remains to be seen, but the timeline is absolutely spot on. Bring it on, we say.",
      "READ NEXT: Yoane Wissa deserves our sympathy…but not as much as poor Brentford fans",
      "A new report has revealed Manchester United’s ‘internal feeling’ on Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle United prepare an ‘approach’ for an alternative.",
      "Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is tipped to be the “missing link up front” for Liverpool by ex-Reds defender John Arne Riise.",
      "Newcastle United and RB Leipzig have been left stunned by ‘unexpected move’ from Man Utd to make a huge bid for Benjamin Sesko, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have put their ‘first offer’ on the table for Benjamin Sesko as they battle Newcastle for the RB Leipzig striker, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have already come up with a three-part ‘plan’ to get more out of Alexander Isak than rivals Newcastle United.",
      "Man Utd will ‘end up’ signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko this summer despite Newcastle’s latest bid, according to reports."

      "The Magpies have already had a bid worth €80m rejected by RB Leipzig for Sesko as the Bundesliga club were not happy with the structure of the deal despite the Magpies reaching their valuation.",
      "Sky Germany reporter Philipp Hinze claimed on Monday that Manchester United are prepared to ‘match’ the €80m asking price and Leipzig ‘would welcome a possible bidding war’.",

      "That is supported by the Bild report, but it states they are ‘expected’ to make the offer only when Sesko rejects Newcastle and ‘commits’ to the Red Devils.",
      "But Sesko needs United to guarantee that they can financially support the deal, which is not guaranteed, because they still need to sell players in order to do so.",

      "Newcastle and Manchester United have both made bids for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 17:47, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle and Manchester United have both lodged bids in the region of £70m.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",

      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19.
