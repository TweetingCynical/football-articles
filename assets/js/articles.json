      "Alongside the regular selections of Premier League winners, relegated teams and top scorers, the pair also pointed the spotlight on managers to keep an eye on. Liverpool icon Carragher plumped for Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner - the Austrian having led the Eagles to the FA Cup and Community Shield in 2025.",
      "Neville had a different idea though and selected Manchester United boss Amorim. Seeing that prediction, Carragher burst into fits of laughter, which did not go down too well with Neville.",
      "He said: “Why you laughing?” to which Carragher replied: “You pick the Man United manager every year on that.”",
      "“I don’t pick them every year, it’s disrespectful,” Neville then said before Carragher pointed out: “You picked three of the last year and one of them was Ten Hag.”",
      "Explaining his thought process, the United icon said: “The reason last year was a similar reason to this. Ten Hag last year because I knew if he started badly, he’d be under massive pressure. Similarly, there’s probably going to be no in between here.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, if he starts off badly and they’re in 13th, 14th in October, November, he’s going to be under massive pressure. He’s the Manchester United manager, he has to deliver in these first few months of the season and I think he will outperform.",
      "“I know you’re not sure about him and you sort of wrote your article the other day saying that you think he’s not that good. Well, what was your article about?”",
      "Carragher then replied: “It was about the two managers, Arteta and Amorim and how Amorim would be delighted if he was in Arteta’s position in three or four years.”",
      "United have already made a difficult start following a summer that has seen them spend over £200m. They slipped to a slender 1-0 reverse to Old Trafford on Sunday - Amorim’s 15th Premier League defeat in 28 games since his arrival at the club from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "United will be aiming to get back on track this weekend as they take on Fulham at Craven Cottage. The Red Devils then kick off their Carabao Cup campaign the following week with a showdown with Grimsby Town.",

      "The Manchester United squad is in broad agreement with Alan Shearer following the positive opening weekend display against Arsenal. One of the best displays in recent memory from United went unrewarded as an Altay Bayindir error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to head the Gunners in front early on, with United unable to convert any of their 22 attempts at goal in 1-0 loss.",
      "Although they suffered defeat, many United fans left Old Trafford feeling upbeat about the impact of new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a revitalised attack that kept Mikel Arteta’s side pegged back for long stretches. Following the game, the feeling within the squad was one of encouragement.",
      "That feeling was shared by Premier League legend Shearer, who hasn’t been afraid to stick the boot in on both United and Ruben Amorim in recent times. But speaking on the Rest is Football with Gary Lineker and Miach Richards, the Newcastle icon said: “I think for me the two standouts [were Cunha and Mbeumo].",
      "“Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "“I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.”",
      "Amorim also brought up United’s improved intensity levels as he hailed the performance, saying: “It’s more about the intensity our players play at, if they are brave, if they are talented, if they are powerful. We show a little bit more than that.",
      "“We have a lot to do and have to focus on the next one. I think also, they understand better the way we have to do it.",
      "“They are prepared to do it physically and they want to help each other. That is a very good feeling. Sometimes, you can see one guy missing one run or one pass and you feel the team is all together.”",
      "However, Shearer cautioned that United must sign a new keeper if they are to make genuine strides this season, with question marks over error-prone pair Bayindir and Andre Onana. United have been linked with PSG stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Shearer said: “I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",

      "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher have issued their thoughts on the 2025-26 Premier League season - and have once again failed to see eye-to-eye. The new campaign got underway over the weekend, with title holders Liverpool getting off to a perfect start.",
      "Contenders Arsenal and Manchester City also secured three points on the opening day. But Chelsea stumbled against Crystal Palace despite their huge summer spend.",
      "And those results appear to have changed the minds of both Carragher and Neville, who have issued their predictions over what will happen over the next 10 months. Giving his verdict, the Man United icon has predicted Arsenal to win the league - but only just.",
      "He said: “I couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool. I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it. Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.",
      "“Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "“City have an unbelievable spine. I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.”",
      "Carragher disagrees, however, and has picked Liverpool to make it back-to-back titles. He replied: “What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit.",
      "“But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower. A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers.",
      "How do you think the 2025/26 season will play out? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season. I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.”",
      "Away from the title, there is also disparity on the Champions League qualifiers. Carragher sees Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea finishing in the top four, while Neville has predicted the Red Devils to join their cross-city rivals and Liverpool.",
      "Carragher has cheekily plumped for Man United as surprise European contenders, with Neville selecting Nottingham Forest. At the other end of the table, both agree that Wolves and Burnley will slip into the Championship, albeit Carragher believes Sunderland will be relegated, with Neville suggesting Leeds will be condemned to an instant return to the second tier.",
      "Regarding individuals, both pundits selected Erling Haaland as their top scorer for the coming campaign, with Carragher highlighting Florian Wirtz and Neville suggesting Viktor Gyokeres as their impact signings.",
      "They have also backed Estevao and Adrien Truffert of Bournemouth to shine. Finally, Carragher backed Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner to be his manager to watch, while Neville unsurprisingly selected Ruben Amorim.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed that Sol Campbell refused to speak to him for over six months - ignoring him on England duty - as the Arsenal star felt the Manchester United icon dived for an infamous penalty.",
      "In October 2004 the Red Devils ended the Gunners' lengthy unbeaten run, which stood at 49 games. A 2-0 win at Old Trafford left a sour taste for those associated with Arsenal, none more so than Campbell, who gave away the penalty for the opening goal.",
      "It was immediately evident that Campbell was stunned by the decision and felt Rooney simulated to get his team the spot kick. When the two were expected to put differences aside on international duty the centre-half refused to do so.",
      "The Arsenal defender didn't want to engage with Rooney as the bad blood went on for months, leading to some moments of silence when the pair were with the Three Lions. The former United man though insists there was contact and he didn't dive.",
      "He said on The Wayne Rooney Show: \"It was a big game for Arsenal. If they had won it, it was 50 games unbeaten for them. We beat them 2-0 and Campbell did not speak to me for over six months. We met up [during international duty] and Sol won't speak to me. Sometimes, I was with Sol and I'd say to him: 'Come on man, we are playing for England here'. But he wouldn't speak to me because he felt I dived. He left his leg out and I think there was a small contact.\"",
      "Campbell certainly held onto the incident and when he acknowledged Rooney's brilliance in 2017 - some 13 years after the incident - he still accused him of diving. \"What a career Wayne Rooney. A fantastic servant for England. Only one dive that annoyed me against Man Utd 49th game.\"",
      "Theirry Henry is another Arsenal icon to come out over the years and call out Rooney for his dive, which ended his side's historic run. He refused to entertain any theory other than the United legend conning the ref.",
      "He said: \"I think they were superior on the day, but it was still 0-0 and we would take a 0-0. But Rooney dived. I don't care however people say whatever, he did dive and that's how they got the penalty. When you see the replay you clearly see Sol Campbell doesn't extend his leg, he pulls it back, and Rooney was clever to get that penalty.\"",
      "Campbell would play for England for another three years after his incident with Rooney before eventually retiring in 2007. Neither Arsenal nor United would claim the title the year the Invincible's had their run ended with Chelsea claiming the title and the Gunners winning the battle for second.",

      "Gary Neville has told Marcus Rashford to concentrate on Barcelona rather than comment on Ruben Amorim’s work at Manchester United. Rashford has left behind his boyhood club to join Barca on loan for the 2025-26 season, but couldn’t help giving his take on the rebuilding job Amorim has on his hands at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford had some damning criticism for United, claiming they can’t hide behind the excuse of being a club in transition. “To start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it,” he said last week on The Rest is Football Podcast.",
      "“This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. We’ve had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no man’s land.”",
      "“All eyes are on him. Can he do it? He had a horrible start to his United career. He didn’t want the job part way through last season.”",
      "Presenter David Jones interjected: “Do you not think because of that he gets this season, whatever happens?”",
      "“Oh no I don’t think it’ll be that easy,” responded Neville. “I think if he’s down in the bottom half of the table he’ll be under massive pressure.”",
      "Again Jones interjected, this time asking: “What about what Marcus Rashford said the other day, that Manchester United have got to come up with a plan and stick with it somewhere, haven’t they?”",
      "Neville held up his hand, waved it, and, somewhat damningly remarked: “Let’s ignore that, because I don’t want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight. He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Continuing more broadly on Amorim’s United, and what he’d seen from their opening game of the season – the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal on Sunday – Neville offered: “Yesterday was the first time I watched that formation out on Old Trafford, where I thought ‘right, we’ve got a chance here, that worked'.",
      "“He’d got a few different players in, he’d got [Mason] Mount back, got Luke Shaw in at left centre-back, that helped and I think it was the first time, it’s a difficult, rare system, it needs specialists, but when you saw [Matheus] Cunha play, saw Mount play, saw Shaw at left centre-back - there was a balance! Casemiro looked a better player all of a sudden! Just straight away he looked a better player.”",
      "Laughing, Jamie Carragher interrupted: “It was one game!” United continue their Premier League campaign against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",

      "Manchester United began their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on Sunday – and while there were many new faces, the same old issues reared their head once more.",
      "Despite spending £200million on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, United failed to find the back of David Raya ’s net. Meanwhile, their issues in between the posts continued, with Altay Bayindir at the centre of a debate on Monday after his error for Riccardo Calafiori’s goal.",
      "Thankfully, there are still two weeks left of the summer transfer window for Ruben Amorim and his staff to address some of those issues. The problem for United is that they need to sell some of their unwanted players first before they can bring in more reinforcements.",
      "Unfortunately, there are many moving parts as they try to find new homes for the bomb squad players who have been exiled by Amorim. Here is the latest on those exits – and who could come in.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was conspicuous through his absence on Sunday as we got a look at United’s new-look forward line. Hojlund was left out of the squad entirely by Amorim and the club are now hoping to sell him before the window closes.",
      "They are willing to take a significant hit on the £72million they paid Atalanta a few years ago for his services. And yet things are not that simple, with AC Milan keen but not that keen. United want around £35m for the young Danish striker, but would also consider a loan at this late stage of the window.",
      "Milan, however, have Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic as their top target, although those negotiations have reached a stalemate. Everything is up in the air, as Milan sporting director Igli Tare said: “Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.”",
      "Jadon Sancho is another player United are desperate to get rid of, but his £250,000-a-week wages are proving problematic. After moves to Juventus and Fenerbahce fell through, it is now the turn of Roma to get frustrated.",
      "The Italian club are threatening to pull out of a deal for the winger, despite agreeing a loan with an obligation to buy. Fabrizio Romano has reported that Sancho has informed Roma he is exploring other options. He has reportedly said no to Besiktas, where there would be a reunion with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and the situation looks set to run until the end of the window.",
      "Meanwhile, Alejandro Garnacho also remains a United player. Chelsea are keen on the winger, but need to first sell Christopher Nkunku to Bayern Munich. The German side have failed with a loan bid for Nkunku because the Blues want a permanent deal so they can sign either Garnacho or Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly agreed terms with Manchester City and is now waiting for Ederson to move to Galatasaray. However, Bayindir’s shocker on Sunday, and Andre Onana’s general struggles at United, have raised the prospect of Donnarumma moving to a different part of Manchester.",
      "United enquired earlier in the summer about Donnarumma and Wayne Rooney believes they should try to hijack City’s move. He said on his podcast : \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher believes Manchester United were correctly denied a penalty in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal on Sunday afternoon. Matheus Cunha tumbled inside the box following contact with William Saliba during the closing moments of the Premier League clash.",
      "Having latched onto Matthijs de Ligt's delivery in the area, the summer recruit failed to make proper contact with the ball. Saliba appeared to catch Cunha's left foot, but referee Simon Hooper chose not to punish the defender.",
      "Bothroyd then questioned why, highlighting the prospect of such a challenge being penalised elsewhere on the pitch, asking: \"How's that not a penalty? That's a guaranteed penalty. If that happens on the half-way line, that's a free-kick. Is it a free-kick on the halfway line?\"",
      "Gallagher responded: \"It wasn't on the halfway line. I don't play that game,\" prompting Bothroyd to instantly reply: \"Why not? A free-kick on the halfway line should be the same as in the box.\"",
      "After Gallagher responded: \"I agree on that. No, not a foul,\" Bothroyd snapped back: \"That's definitely a foul. He's come through the back of him. The ball was there, he came through the back of him and hit the foot that he planted. It's a penalty.\"",
      "Despite Bothroyd's insistence, Gallagher ended the discussion by stating: \"You judge what happens and at that point, I don't think it's a foul. I wouldn't give a foul [anywhere else on the pitch].\"",
      "Ex-Premier League official Keith Hackett also agreed with Hooper's original decision. Hackett told Football Insider: \"There is no doubt that the defender made contact with Cunha.",
      "\"The problem here is that the player is already falling down backwards and was searching for a penalty kick. The referee is spot on. VAR isn’t going to get involved because it’s not a clear and obvious error.",
      "\"Players often exaggerate their fall when a foul has taken place, and that exaggeration often makes the referee not give it. Saliba has made a genuine attempt for the ball, and Cunha is already on his way down. He’s not even facing the goal – why? There are lots of questions to be asked here.\"",
      "United travel to Fulham in their next Premier League game on August 31st. The Cottagers drew 1-1 away to Brighton on the weekend, with Rodrigo Muniz cancelling out Matt O'Riley's penalty in the 96th minute for the west Londoners.",

Garnacho, who made his international debut as a teenager in 2023, was a consistent selection by boss Lionel Scaloni in 2024, but has been left on the outside looking in during 2025.",
      "During United's pre-season tour of the United States, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho and himself. He said: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",

      "The drama ignited at Old Trafford on Sunday as United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir flapped at a corner, allowing Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori a simple tap-in to put Mikel Arteta's team a goal to the good. The incident led to former professionals struggling to defend the Turkish goalkeeper, while former referee Mark Clattenburg also claimed the winner shouldn't have stood.",
      "Bayindir called for a foul following the incident due to pressure on him from Arsenal defender William Saliba. However, VAR did not feel the incident needed to be brought to the attention of referee Simon Hooper.",
      "Keys believes Arsenal got away with the goal and claimed Arteta's side often \"push boundaries\" when it comes to set-pieces. He wrote: \"Weak? Maybe a little bit. Soft? Perhaps. Could’ve done better? Of course. That’s always the case. Few leave a field of play satisfied with what they’ve done. But - Bayindir was fouled.",
      "\"We all know what Arsenal do at set-pieces. They push boundaries all the time. Sometimes they get away with it - on other occasions they don’t. They did yesterday (Sunday).",
      "\"Now I’ll explain why Saliba should’ve been penalised. I have no problem with him standing where he did. He’s entitled to do that, but the moment he blocks the keeper by turning his back to him and then backing into him - that’s a foul. Take another look at where Bayindir ends up. He’s in the back of the net with the ball. Saliba sent him there.\"",
      "While the common consensus seems to suggest that Bayindir was fouled, ex-United captain Gary Neville slammed the United goalkeeper. “It’s going to keep hurting United,\" said Neville from the commentary box.",
      "\"The goalkeeper has got to be stronger. I think he will complain that he was fouled. He’s got a player in front of him, there’s a lot of pushing and shoving going on. I just think your goalkeeper has to be stronger.",
      "\"Get that player out of the way. It’s Saliba. He’s not got his arms up, I don’t think he’s done anything wrong at all. Bayındır if anything has his arm on him. He just parries it, it goes through his hands. It’s definitely a goal. He’s just not strong enough.”",
      "Bayindir was given the nod in goal as Andre Onana missed out on Amorim's squad at Old Trafford. Defending his goalkeeper, United boss Ruben Amorim insisted Arsenal’s winner should have been disallowed.",
      "“I understand we want goals, but when you touch the goalkeeper that way, I think it’s hard. Especially to lose with a goal like this, I think it’s hard. It was a strange goal,\" he said.",
      "“When you touch the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it's the rules. If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes added: “Altay was saying in the moment he goes to push the ball, he gets a touch. But we know in the Premier League they don’t give much in these type of situations, even if they had a meeting with us saying that if the players are blocking and not looking at the ball, they will whistle more.”",

      "Mikel Arteta still wants to strengthen his left wing options - but must sell before he can do more transfer business. That leaves Arsenal facing the prospect of not making any more big money moves in this window unless they start to ship players out.",
      "The Gunners have already been linked with Real Madrid superstar Rodrygo while Arteta is a huge fan of Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze but both will not move to the Emirates unless there is a big last minute shift. Tottenham are now in pole position to land Eze with negotiations ongoing as they look to seal a £60m deal - £55m plus £5m in add-ons - but Palace are determined to stand firm and drive a good deal.",
      "That is currently out of Arsenal’s reach because they have a bloated squad with all their new £200m-plus worth of arrivals but they have so far struggled to get players out of the door with the spotlight on sporting director Andrea Berta to balance the books. Leandro Trossard is most likely to go at this stage as Brentford, Aston Villa and several foreign clubs have shown interest in the versatile forward who is now further down the pecking order. First team squad members Jakub Kiwior, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson did not even make the bench at Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "Teenager Max Dowman, 15, was at the game but was left out of the match day squad while Christian Norgaard had a small knock and Gabriel Jesus is recovering from a long term knee injury.",
      "Fenerbahce have shown an interest in Zinchenko who only has a year left on his contract while Porto and Stuttgart are interested in Vieira with the Gunners keen to do a permanent deal. Lokonga has also attracted interest while Kiwior is considering his options after falling down the pecking order despite an impressive finish to last season.",
      "Arsenal signed Noni Madueke from Chelsea for £52m but Gabriel Martinelli started the season at Old Trafford and there is a feeling that they would still like to bring in extra quality. But the interest in Eze did not progress because that would also block off the pathway for Ethan Nwaneri and Dowman getting first team opportunities.",
      "They must offload to do more deals in this window but if another move is to be done then a left winger would be the most likely.",

      "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho remains among the players expected to leave Old Trafford this summer. However, offloading the winger is proving tougher than expected, though, with Sancho understood to have rejected a pair of potential exits.",
      "Sancho remains among United's highest earners, and is reluctant to take a big hit on his wages. Frustratingly for United, the clubs most interested in a move are not high on the winger's own list of preferences. Roma and Besiktas are the clubs to express an interest. The latter are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who brought Sancho to Old Trafford back in 2021 but got the sack a few short months after that.",
      "According to reports on the continent, Sancho doesn't want to move to the Turkish Super Lig at this stage of his career. He is also believed to ave told Roma he doesn't want to join them in this window. Part of the issue with Roma, it has been claimed, is the club's reluctance to match Sancho's £250,00 wages. However, he is also said to be unconvinced by the prospect of a move to Italy.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, who had an obligation to sign the winger if they finished high enough in the league. They were able to pay United £5m to escape that obligation, though, and the former Borussia Dortmund star is now back at Old Trafford.",
      "He was left out of the matchday squad for the Premier League opener at Arsenal and has not been assigned a squad number for the 2025-26 season. The number 25 shirt, which he wore for his last United appearance in the 2024 Community Shield, now belongs to Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Sancho isn't the only United fringe player being linked with a move away. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have also been sidelined by head coach Ruben Amorim, while Rasmus Hojlund was left out on Sunday despite featuring in pre-season.",
      "\"It is our player - we have to make choices,\" Amorim said when asked about Hojlund. \"We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside.\"",
      "AC Milan looks like the most likely destination for the Dane, who is no longer first choice after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko. \"Hojlund is a good option for us,\" Milan sporting director Igli Tare told SportMediaset over the weekend.",

      "Manchester United and Manchester City look set to do battle in the transfer market for wantaway PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian has confirmed he is sure to leave the French capital this summer, having been frozen out.",
      "Donnarumma played a starring role for Les Parisiens as they won the Champions League last season, but after the arrival of French international Lucas Chevalier, his days in Paris seem numbered. Both the red and sky blue halves of Manchester are now supposedly interested.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are in need of a quality shot-stopper, with Altay Bayindir's flaws exposed in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal and Andre Onana making multiple mistakes last term. City, on the other hand, seemed to have found their No.1 for the future this summer in the form of James Trafford.",
      "But with Ederson set to leave, having been linked with Turkish side Galatasaray, Pep Guardiola remains interested in bringing in the 26-year-old Italian. Where Donnarumma will end up is unknown, but he has been involved in controversial transfer negotiations before, namely in 2017 when he re-signed with boyhood AC Milan, and rumours of a clause involving his brother arose.",
      "In 2017, a still-teenage Donnarumma had become AC Milan's starting goalkeeper and was considered one of the most promising shot-stoppers in Europe. With his contract up, he seemed destined to go elsewhere, with the likes of Juventus and Real Madrid waiting in the wings, but a drastic U-turn occurred.",
      "Although the player's agent, the late Mino Raiola, declared he would not re-sign at the San Siro, Donnarumma put pen to paper on a new deal until 2021, with some alleged interesting clauses insisted upon.",
      "It was reported at the time that as part of this new deal, Donnarumma's brother, Antonio, 27, who was also a goalkeeper playing for Asteras Tripolis, would have to be signed by I Rossoneri. This £1m transfer was completed just one day after the younger brother had penned his new contract.",
      "Antonio was paid roughly £850,000 annually, six times less than his younger sibling. However, AC Milan's sporting director, Massimiliano Mirabelli, made headlines for rubbishing the existence of any clause in Donnarumma's new contract.",
      "\"The first thing we had to do was to renew Gigio's contract, but I immediately had the idea of bringing in his brother Antonio too,\" he admitted in 2017.",
      "\"The technical evaluation comes first and I think Antonio can be a 12th man for Milan. He is not a postage parcel like someone said. I'm sorry for him if certain things have been written.",
      "\"Vincenzo Montella [former AC Milan manager] also endorsed this signing. I know him well and I wanted to bring the family back together. I'm proud to present the Donnarumma pair.\"",
      "Antonio, who had played for AC Milan in his youth before moving on to Genoa, outraged some fans with his arrival. However, he released a kind-hearted message eight years ago after he made a move that was subject to contrasting reports and remains somewhat of a mystery.",
      "\"I will be in the dressing room with my brother, which makes me very happy. It is a beautiful thing to be back at Milan,\" admitted Antonio, who currently plays for Serie C side Salernitana.",
      "After his deal expired, Donnarumma left for PSG in 2021 and now looks set for a new chapter. His brother, Antonio, also departed Milan four years ago, moving to Padova shortly after his sibling's exit, and ended up with his current outfit by way of Torino.",

      "The Premier League returned at the weekend – and with it so did the VAR controversy. Six teams picked up maximum points on the opening day, including Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, who narrowly overcame Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "But it was the video assistant referee that has dominated the headlines once again, with a number of contentious decisions sparking debate online. Arguably the biggest talking point came during Chelsea's opener against Crystal Palace, which saw Eberechi Eze's free-kick ruled out for contravening one of the little-known rules of the game.",
      "One of the most talked-about decisions saw Eze's stunning free-kick ruled out by VAR. Eze struck a venomous effort from outside the box that was too powerful for Robert Sanchez and appeared to have given Palace a shock lead at Stamford Bridge early in the first-half.",
      "However, the celebrations were quickly halted as the goal was checked. The goal was subsequently ruled out to the incredulity of the Palace fans, with one of their players deemed to have stood too close to the Chelsea wall.",
      "Referee Darren England announced to the crowd: \"After review, away number six [Marc Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.\"",
      "Guehi was deemed to have been encroaching on Chelsea's free-kick wall - Moises Caicedo in particular - as per law 13 of the International Football Association Board. This law states: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1m (1 yard) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\"",
      "The match between finished 0-0, and viewers were quick to jump on social media to share their disdain at the early decision. One wrote: \"Just to be clear, that Eze freekick shouldn't have been ruled out. I would have lost my mind if we had a goal chopped off for that.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we had scored a freekick like Eze’s today and it was ruled out for the same reason my head would be on mars,\" and a third added: \"Palace were well and truly robbed earlier that Eze freekick should've stood.\"",
      "However, despite the uproar, according to the laws of the game the correct decision was made by VAR.",
      "In the first game of the new campaign on Friday night, reigning champions Liverpool took on Bournemouth at Anfield. Early in the first half, Cherries defender Marcos Senesi appeared to have handled the ball near the halfway line, after initially attempting to control it with his thigh.",
      "Without this intervention, Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike looked to be away through on goal unchallenged, leading to a barrage of comments online criticising what seemed to be a huge miss from VAR.",
      "One wrote: \"PGMOL an absolute laughing stock just 13 minutes into the new Premier League season as a blatant handball and red card ignored by VAR, despite the whole world watching Bournemouth’s Senesi deliberately deny Ekitike and Liverpool a chance to score.\"",
      "Another said: \"That was a clear handball by Senesi,\" while a third noted: \"How did senesi not get booked for that handball tho?\"",
      "However, the decision was checked by VAR at the time, and the Premier League Match Centre X account cleared up the confusion for social media users via a tweet posted minutes after the incident. It read: \"The referee’s call of no red card to Senesi was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed not to be a clear handball offence nor denial of a goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO), due to the distance from goal.\"",
      "In the same game, the Cherries were denied a chance to equalise on the stroke of half-time with the scoreline still a 1-0. When a ball was floated into the box towards Senesi, he headed it back across the area into the path of an onrushing Alex Scott.",
      "However, Alexis Mac Allister challenged for the ball and the pair ended up in a heap on the ground, with Bournemouth fans screaming for a spot kick. It is unclear whether the alleged foul was checked by VAR, but supporters were up in arms about the moment on social media immediately.",
      "Alongside a clip of the incident, one wrote: \"Penalty against Liverpool in the first half? Didn’t get a replay or even a mention of it at half time…\" Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett also believed Bournemouth should have been awarded a penalty.",
      "He said: \"Bournemouth had a real strong shout for a penalty kick when Alexis Mac Allister came in and clattered Alex Scott. It was a careless challenge, and as such, it is a foul. This should have resulted in a penalty kick to Bournemouth.\"",
      "However, nothing was given and Liverpool went on to win the game 4-2, despite a spirited Bournemouth fightback.",
      "In Aston Villa's goalless draw with Newcastle, Ezri Konsa left his team with 10 men for a good majority of the second half due to his foul denying an \"obvious goal scoring opportunity\". In the 66th minute of the game, a ball was clipped into makeshift striker Anthony Gordon, who was through on goal.",
      "However, Konsa pulled the England international back just beyond the halfway line, and received a red card for his troubles by referee Craig Pawson - which was then checked by VAR and confirmed.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre updated viewers on the decision, as they wrote: \"The referee’s call of red card to Konsa for the denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO) was checked and confirmed by VAR.\"",
      "Fans were less irritated by this decision, with many agreeing that the referee and his video assistant on the sidelines had made the correct decision. One wrote: \"Hard to argue against the earlier Aston Villa red card.\"",
      "But despite having a man advantage for the best part of half an hour at Villa Park, the Magpies failed to capitalise and the two sides played out a 0-0 draw.",
      "Some Manchester United fans felt hard done by after their 1-0 defeat by Arsenal following an incident involving William Salbia and Matheus Cunha right at the death. In the final minute of normal time, the ball was crossed into the Portuguese midfielder when Saliba appeared to go through the back of Matheus, with footage showing the Frenchman's left foot connecting with his opponent's.",
      "Cunha went down but United's appeals for a penalty were waved away by Simon Hooper who allowed play to continue, before VAR concluded that it did not warrant a penalty.",
      "Regardless, the decision wasn't given on the field or by VAR and Arsenal held on to secure all three points on the opening day of the season at Old Trafford.",

      "Gyokores, 27, did not get a single shot on target and was substituted after making his first Arsenal start in the Premier League at Manchester United.",
      "It left many fans wondering about his match sharpness and fitness and the Sweden international has only managed two weeks of full training after his protracted switch from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Gyokores represents a big gamble for the Gunners as he was prolific at Sporting but has yet to prove himself in a top league and he is now in the spotlight at Arsenal.",
      "But Saka is convinced about his new team mate’s qualities and says Gyokores will be ready for the physical challenges of the Premier League. England winger Saka said: “I was impressed with him and he battled for us. It was tough. There was a big battle up there. I thought he did well.",
      "“His performance gives us something to build on and I am sure it will help him next week. He has slotted in well and so have the other guys.”",

Our decision making was not great and that cost us and gave United a lot of momentum. We did not get punished for it but we cannot do it every game.”",

      "When Manchester City signed former AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders for £46.5m, it looked like a good deal for a player who had scored 15 goals last season and was entering his peak years.",
      "That fee however now looks to be a real bargain following one of the best Premier League debuts of recent years. The Dutchman put in a real virtuoso performance in City’s 4-0 trouncing of Wolves at Molineux. He covered basically every blade of grass, showed excellent creativity and composure. And he even had the finish to open his goalscoring account for his new club with a well-taken strike.",
      "It’s not often you see a new signing take to a brand new league with such little effort but to come away with a goal and an assist represents an excellent return for Reijnders.",
      "So often last season City lacked a real midfield presence due to Rodri’s knee injury but Reijnders appears to be just the man to replace him at the Etihad. If he can keep up those levels, then there is no reason why he can’t be a key cog in another relentless trophy-winning machine under Pep Guardiola.",
      "It is hardly the biggest headline from the weekend, but it could mark a significant improvement. On Saturday, Martin Dubravka became the first victim of a new Premier League rule. Burnley were just three minutes and 13 seconds into their top-flight campaign when Dubravka got his hands on the ball against Tottenham, before quickly losing it again.",
      "Burnley's new goalkeeper held onto the ball for longer than eight seconds and therefore conceded a corner. The rule is designed to limit time wasting, which has become a scourge of elite football. Unlike many other changes to the game, this appears like a simple and easily applied one, which hopefully will have a positive impact.",
      "Unfortunately, it can't stop the more conventional method of time wasting, which serial perpetrator David Raya demonstrated against Manchester United the following day. The Arsenal goalkeeper took an age over every goal kick or free-kick and was finally booked late on at Old Trafford. Time wasting will no doubt continue in those situations and from throw-ins, but one avenue has at least been shut down.",
      "Going into the new season, some worried whether Pep Guardiola’s motivation was waning and a few even speculated he might not have long left as Manchester City manager. Now, though, it looks as though all he heeded was some shiny new toys to play with.",
      "Some ruthless finishing sent City top with a 4-0 win at Wolves, with two of those summer signings on target. Tijjani Reijnders stole the show, but Rayan Cherki’s cameo showcased a level of creativity that could really come in handy against tougher-to-break-down opponents.",
      "Not only that, but Oscar Bobb has made an early case for the ‘like a new signing’ badge after missing the bulk of last season through injury - with Rodri still to return.",
      "Yes, it’s worth recognising that City won their first four games last season before Rodri’s injury. But winning in this manner while still waiting for the Spaniard to take his place in the side will surely worry their rivals for the title.",
      "We can be guilty of not always realising just how good a foreign player is until they play in the Premier League and it looks as if Tijjani Reijnders might be the latest example.With Kevin De Bruyne no longer part of the furniture at Man City they've bought in the Dutchman, who was an instant hit on his debut during the win at Wolves. He was on the scoresheet, as was Rayan Cherki, who could be another massive hit.",
      "City's recruitment may not have seen them land the household names, but Reijnders could yet prove to be an absolute steal having joined from AC Milan for £42.5m.There's no doubt that those on the blue side of Manchester have gone under the radar, regardless of what the pundits say. Few have tipped them to regain their Premier League crown, but that may suit them as they embark on a new era under Pep Guardiola.",
      "My biggest takeaway from the opening weekend was Granit Xhaka might just be one of the signings of the season. While falling hopelessly headfirst into the trap of making judgements after one game, Sunderland’s incredible summer spending spree - in excess of £150m - gave them the energy to beat West Ham and the belief they can stay up.",
      "At the heart of that is former Arsenal captain Xhaka who now wears the armband at the Stadium of Light and, at 32, is the experienced leader a newly-promoted club needs.",
      "When the deal was first mooted, most fans were a bit surprised. He is swapping Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap but it actually shows ambition and determination.",
      "Sunderland’s was the best win of the weekend in my eyes. We desperately need one - hopefully two - of the newly-promoted clubs to stay up. It’s ridiculous that we keep seeing three up and three straight back down. It’s bad for the league.",
      "But a rocking, loud and raucous Stadium of Light is good for the Premier League. I did tip Sunderland to go down before the season started - but I so hope they prove me wrong.",
      "Plenty of players have come and gone this summer, and big hitters like Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah remain, but if you could guarantee Liverpool supporters that one star would stay fit throughout the season then plenty are going to say Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Redeployed at the base of midfield, the Dutchman started every game last season up until the point that the title was secured, but his red card on the final day against Crystal Palace meant that he was suspended for the opener against Bournemouth on Friday, and it showed.",
      "The Cherries were able to cut through the Liverpool midfield far too easily, and while more alterations and additions are expected in defence and attack in the remainder of the transfer window, getting Gravenberch back into his position as the midfield anchor is imperative for a Liverpool side who shipped 11 goals in six pre-season matches, including two in the Community Shield which Gravenberch missed as his partner gave birth.",
      "Liverpool will face a fiery welcome at Newcastle next Monday, and they're going to need their midfield lynchpin available.",
      "Are Arsenal going to play like this every week? If so then they will struggle to beat the big boys and finally land the title. They were hard to watch at Old Trafford. Yes they were defensively resolute but Roy Keane was right - why didn’t they look to kill off United?",
      "Martin Odegaard still looks off his best and that has to be a worry. So many counter attacks he ruined by making the wrong decision or misplacing a pass. Liverpool certainly looked defensively vulnerable but they were ruthless in attack on Friday night while Manchester City were clinical and calm in walloping Wolves.",
      "Arsenal looked sluggish and sloppy against an improved United but certainly not a title-challenging team from Old Trafford. It’s great to be good at set pieces but, my word, how long do they take over each one?",
      "Arsenal have the attacking talent to be explosive and exciting to watch but last season they were too often boring and drew too many games. If they repeat their Old Trafford performance against better teams than United then they will be doing the same again this season.",
      "So if you're an attacking player you can't be within one metre (or a yard) of a wall which has three or more defending players in it. Who knew? Well it seemed as though Marc Guehi didn't, judging by his reaction to referee Darren England when Eberechi Eze's goal was ruled out for Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "So learning a new law of the game might well be my biggest takeaway from the opening weekend. The challenge for the referees now will be to ensure that the rule is consistently applied, because surely this type of thing has happened before and not been punished?",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bayern Munich have failed with a loan bid to land Christopher Nkunku - which has been rejected by Chelsea as they seek to raise funds for their pursuit of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Manchester United winger is one of two forwards who are being eyed by the Blues - alongside RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons. And as a result they are not looking to sanction any temporary exits which has seen them reject the German's approach for the Frenchman.",
      "Those at Old Trafford are willing to sanction Garnacho's departure with the Argentine falling out of favour. The player himself is keen on a move away to reignite his career and sees Stamford Bridge as the ideal destination.",
      "However his move is contingent on a transfer merry-go-round that needs Chelsea to raise capital to continue their recruitment. As a result they have told Bayern, who want to bring Nkunku back to the Bundesliga, that they only want a permanent sale, reports The Times.",
      "Bayern remain interested in Nkunku as they need to bolster their attack following the sale Kingsley Coman to Al-Nassr on Friday. But given that they and Chelsea want two different deals, any movement is currently unlikely.",
      "Inter Milan are also thought to be interested in Nkunku, but again they have been told that they would need to pursue a permanent move. Leipzig previously considered an approach, but the player is not interest in a return to his former club given they not qualify for the Champions League this season.",
      "Nkunku has four years remaining on his contract after joining the Blues in the summer of 2023. He made a £52million switch from Leipzig after scoring 58 times in two seasons. At Chelsea though he's scored just 18 times in 62 games.",
      "United remain keen on sell Garnacho and are prepared for an offer from Chelsea. Any sale would be beneficial for those in Manchester as the Argentine, an academy graduate, would represent pure profit, which would aid their PSR figures.",
      "Jadon Sancho is another player they want to offload. He, like Garnacho, appears to have little future at Old Trafford currently but he's turned down a move to Roma. The Italians were willing to pay £17m but the winger is still waiting to review his options having been linked with several clubs.",

      "Nicky Butt believes PSR and a lack of city appeal are the two reasons Newcastle United have fallen short with transfers this summer. The Magpies have endured a chaotic summer while attempting to strengthen their squad for a fresh Premier League campaign.",
      "Top targets like Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, James Trafford and Benjamin Sesko all chose different destinations despite a wealth of interest. While Newcastle have managed to land the likes of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest in a £55million deal and Malick Thiaw from AC Milan for £34.5m, plenty of supporters will feel let down by missed opportunities.",
      "This is particularly galling given that Newcastle will come up against several of their would-be signings this season when they meet the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City.",
      "While Eddie Howe has moaned that rigid PSR restrictions are \"controlling\" his team's capacity to compete in the current window, Butt claims that there's an additional element at work which might not go down well with the passionate Toon Army.",
      "Speaking to Chronicle Live via BetMGM, the midfielder, who turned out at St James' Park between 2004 and 2010, said: \"I think PSR will definitely come into play, and I think Eddie's such an experienced man, experienced manager and coach, he wouldn't put things out there that he's going to get thrown back in his face as lies.",
      "\"That'll be definitely a big part of it, but I think the thing with Newcastle is, until you're in the club, and unless you know about it... so I knew about it playing against them in the good old days, I knew what a big club it was, and how passionate the supporters were, and when I was going there I knew all about the football club.",
      "\"But some of the players don't know. They don't know how big a football club it is, don't know it's a one-club city, they don't really understand the dynamics of the demographic up there, and obviously it's not London. It's not one of the so-called shining light cities.",
      "\"Even though it's a city, it's not in that kind of elk. It's tough to get. Manchester had a bit for a long time to try to get players from London to Manchester United, it was tough because it wasn't the glamorous city that it probably is now.",
      "\"I think Newcastle are finding that and it's sad. You have to throw something at these players to make it more attractive, which is, you know, more money for some of the players, they get turned on by that. Obviously they're in Europe, in the Champions League and stuff now, so that helps.\"",
      "Butt also believes that Newcastle will be able to lure players who aren't simply chasing a hefty wage packet, and that the club will be capable of landing stars who genuinely fancy playing for Newcastle out of pure passion for the game. He added: \"But yeah, you have to try and get the right ones that want to be there, and I think the ones you lose anyway, in the long run you're better off losing them.",
      "\"Yes, I understand there's finances being involved, because no one's going to go to work at the building site down there for five hundred quid when they can and go and build this out there for five grand. You've got a family to look after, and you've got the rest of your life, so I get finances coming into play, but you've really got to want to play for a football club.\"",
      "It comes as the Magpies found themselves short of firepower when the fresh Premier League campaign kicked off on Saturday. Anthony Gordon was pressed into service as a makeshift No. 9 against Aston Villa due to Alexander Isak's continuing transfer uncertainty.",
      "While numerous supporters will be content with a point secured following a scoreless stalemate at Villa Park, others will be hoping to see Howe and the club's hierarchy move swiftly regarding bringing in a replacement for the restless Swede, particularly considering Gordon's minimal influence.",
      "Newcastle have reportedly set their sights on Brentford's star striker Yoane Wissa, who has hinted at his willingness to make the move up north. However, insiders at the Bees have made it clear that they won't let him go without securing a fitting replacement.",
      "The Magpies have also been linked with Paris Saint-Germain ace, Goncalo Ramos. However, the forward has pledged his loyalty to the Parc des Princes for the foreseeable future, leaving Newcastle to explore other options.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "AC Milan have confirmed their interest in Rasmus Hojlund - but there are two major hurdles to overcome. Milan sporting director Igli Tare told Mediaset: “Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.”",
      "The Italian giants are also interested in Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic but the clubs have reached a stalemate over the fee and his contract. That is the reason behind their interest in Manchester United misfit Hojlund but Milan still face a battle to convince the Denmark striker to give up on Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim admitted Hojlund was left out for his club’s opener with Arsenal and he must now choose whether to stay and fight for his place or leave.",
      "United are keen to do a deal to help balance the books after a £200m spending spree on a new forward line of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "It would mean taking a huge hit on 22-year-old Hojlund who joined from Atalanta for a staggering £72m in August 2023.",
      "However, Hojlund has struggled badly at Old Trafford and he is surplus to requirements but he may be reluctant to leave with United keen on a permanent deal - they want closer to £35m - but would also entertain a loan.",
      "Vlahovic has been Milan’s No1 target with Juventus ready to offload him but it now remains to been whether that deal could be reignited.",
      "There is a belief that Milan could ultimately prefer Vlahovic but have become frustrated in their attempts - and yet he is still a big option.",

      "Sancho, 25, is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and a £20m deal has been agreed for a loan with an obligation to buy the England international. But Sancho’s £250,000-a-week wages have been a major sticking point as the winger does not want to take a financial hit.",
      "It would also appear by the long, drawn out negotiations that he has some reservations about moving to Italy and another loan move after joining Chelsea and former club Borussia Dortmund on loan during his nightmare spell at United.",

The Swedish striker scored 54 goals in his final season in Portugal, but didn't even register a shot on his top-flight debut for the Gunners.",
      "It brings to an end a streak lasting some 28 months. Gyokeres registered at least one shot in every single one of his league appearances for Sporting, but failed to do so for Arsenal against Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "You have to go back 69 games for the last time Gyokeres failed to register a shot in a league outing. According to BBC Sport, the game in question was Coventry vs Blackburn in the Championship, with the Sky Blues claiming a 1-0 win despite their leading man coming up short.",
      "Gyokeres was celebrating another 1-0 win on Sunday despite his personal struggles. Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game, capitalising on an Altay Bayindir error to nod home at the back post after a Declan Rice corner.",
      "Arsenal's new No.14 scored in pre-season during a win at home to Athletic Club. And, while he was made to wait in the league, manager Mikel Arteta recognised he wasn't the only one to find things tough.",
      "\"We came here away and won which is a big result. We were clearly not at our best,\" Arteta told Match of the Day. \"We attacked the box and we reacted well to unusual mistakes. The team reacted time after time in an incredible way. Very proud of that because that is why we got the opportunity to win the game.",
      "\"We showed a resilience and a will to win. They put you on the ropes here, you will have to have moments when you suffer. To find a way to win at this ground, I'm very happy with the team.\"",
      "Arsenal's next game comes at home to Leeds United, who begin their own campaign against Everton on Monday night. Daniel Farke's side scored a league-leading 95 goals en route to promotion from the Championship last term so Arsenal may need to be at their best defensively once more.",
      "No team conceded fewer than Arsenal in last season's Premier League, with goalkeeper David Raya claiming the golden glove award. Raya needed to be sharp to snuff out a couple of United attacks on Sunday, but pointed to the team effort required.",

      "Arsenal’s goal came from their first corner of the game as Riccardo Calafiori headed Declan Rice’s cross over the line after Altay Bayindir failed to punch the ball clear. Bayindir felt he had been impeded by William Saliba, but the goal was allowed to stand.",
      "The goal has seen a continuation of the debate over United’s goalkeepers, with Bayindir standing in for Andre Onana, who missed the game following an injury. Gary Neville felt Bayindir was at fault and needed to be stronger, but ex-Premier League referee Clattenburg had sympathy for the Turkey international.",
      "“In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal's goal,” he told United In Focus. “But when you watch it in slow motion, you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball. PGMOL said they would punish this type of challenge more, but again they failed.”",
      "His words echoed those of Ruben Amorim, who felt aggrieved that the goal was allowed to stand. He said: “I understand we want goals, but when you touch the goalkeeper that way, I think it’s hard. Especially to lose with a goal like this, I think it’s hard. It was a strange goal.",
      "“When you touch the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it's the rules. If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Arsenal have become the masters of scoring from set pieces over the past few seasons and appeared to have identified United’s weakness. Saliba occupied Bayindir, who got a hand to Rice’s cross, but could only divert it into the head of an unmarked Calafiori at the back post.",
      "Neville has urged United to pursue Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is poised to leave Paris Saint-Germain. The ex-United defender believes the big personalities of the two keepers and their ability to cope with pressure would help his old club and Wayne Rooney agrees.",
      "Rooney said on his podcast: \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",
      "However, Amorim insists he is \"happy with the three goalkeepers\" and added: \"I think we prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal and we were the better team. So I’m happy with the players.\"",

      "Onana had three team training sessions before the Arsenal fixture, an insufficient number in Amorim's eyes. So Altay Bayindir kept goal, Tom Heaton was on the bench and Dermot Mee assisted with the warm-up.",
      "Bayindir blundered, United lost and Amorim seethed at the suggestion that Heaton, 40 in April and without any playing time since February 2023, should have started ahead of him.",
      "The post-match questioning centred so heavily on the goalkeeper that it was the quickest an Amorim press conference had been wrapped up. United had performed admirably but lost because of his choice of goalkeeper. Questions on that topic were inevitable.",
      "Whenever Onana does not play, United cannot have him back between the sticks quickly enough. Bayindir did not cover himself in glory at Newcastle United in April when Onana was taken out of the firing line in the wake of his lapses in Lyon.",
      "After persistent questioning from a colleague, Amorim assured journalists he was \"happy\" with the United goalkeeper department. He can't be. Onana has had two error-strewn seasons and Bayindir is inadequate back-up.",
      "This correspondent reported in May that a goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United and they have not wavered. They have been on the lookout for one, serious enough to chance their arm with a loan offer for Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa.",
      "Midway through last season, United considered goalies to come in but not as outright number ones. A competitive understudy to Onana would be the smart move.",
      "Goalkeepers are protective of each other and Onana rates Bayindir. He is in the minority. Bayindir has conceded 21 goals in 12 United appearances. The three matches that they conceded four goals in last season - away at Tottenham, Newcastle and Brentford - came with Bayindir in goal.",
      "The standard of United's first and second-choice goalies is so low there is not an argument to rotate them. It is not even akin to Roy Carroll and Tim Howard in 2004-05, never mind David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard for the first half of the 2011-12 campaign or De Gea and Dean Henderson in 2020-21. If Onana is remotely fit, he should always start.",
      "Erik ten Hag knew it and he was the manager when Bayindir signed. He did just about anything he could to not play him, delaying Onana's release for the Africa Cup of Nations in January 2024. Bayindir's only outings under Ten Hag were against League Two Newport County and League One Barnsley in domestic cup ties.",
      "Bayindir's international situation has partly caused United to preserve the status quo. He is always picked for Turkey squads to play second fiddle, so there is not the incentive for Bayindir to get on the move and guarantee a call-up for the World Cup next year.",
      "Arguably the best 'keeper in the world is on the market now. Paris Saint-Germain want to cash in on Gianluigi Donnarumma but United are not expected to come calling for a goalie reputedly demanding £400,000-a-week. If Donnarumma ends up in Manchester, it is likely to be at City.",
      "Onana expects to stay with United more intent on recruiting a midfielder than a goalkeeper before the September 1 deadline. His hamstring injury has had an undeniable influence on the dormant state of the club's goalkeeping department.",
      "United have promising goalies on loan in the Championship and League Two. Radek Vitek, a teammate of Kobbie Mainoo's and Alejandro Garnacho's in the FA Youth Cup-winning squad in 2022, has kept two clean sheets in two games for Bristol City in the second tier.",
      "The unspoken rule at United is academy players loaned to the Championship have a decent chance of returning to the first team squad. With Heaton in his 40th year and Bayindir and Onana highly unlikely to start a fourth successive season as No.1 and No.2, Vitek is auspiciously placed for a promotion if he continues his solid start at Ashton Gate.",
      "Elyh Harrison is lower down the pyramid at Shrewsbury Town and could be lower come the campaign's conclusion. They have lost their first two matches and are one of the favourites to drop into the National League. Dean Henderson enhanced his reputation on loan at Shrewsbury in 2017-18, back when they were attempting to break into the Championship.",
      "It has been three-and-a-half years since Henderson last played for United and no good can come from dwelling on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's mismanagement of him. United are improving their development of club-trained 'keepers, so much so that Matej Kovar fetched a respectable fee of £7.7million from Bayer Leverkusen in 2023. The Czech Republic number one absconded to PSV Eindhoven last month after Ten Hag, who sanctioned his sale by United, arrived at the BayArena.",
      "Ten Hag resisted a reunion with Onana. His new goalkeeper, Mark Flekken, is Dutch and shares the same agent.",

      "Manchester United lost their opening Premier League game against Arsenal, but there were positives to take from the performance, including Matthijs de Ligt's solid display.",
      "De Ligt, Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw limited Arsenal's chances throughout and were only denied a clean sheet due to an awful goalkeeping error from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "The back three's performance bodes well for the season and De Ligt, in particular, impressed as Arsenal attempted to create, winning eight duels, making six clearances, and winning five aerial duels.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli hardly had a sniff throughout the afternoon. De Ligt probably found Gyokeres on his kitchen table when he emptied his pockets when he returned home.",
      "Former England manager Glenn Hoddle worked as a pundit for Premier League Productions on Sunday and said: “There is excitement over the players he’s brought in, and they looked good, but I thought De Ligt was excellent. It was probably his best game in a United shirt, with the ball and defending.\"",
      "De Ligt was also outstanding when he played Arsenal at the Emirates in January, making important blocks and recovering from an improbable position to deny Leandro Trossard a tap-in.",
      "And when the 26-year-old spoke in pre-season, it was interesting to hear him promise there was more to come in the new campaign",
      "\"Sometimes me and other football fans forget my age,\" he said. \"And as a centre-back you’re normally in your prime at 28 or 29, so in that way, I’m still quite young. Personally, I’d love to carry on from how I was in March, April – I feel that is the level I could show and should show on a consistent basis.",
      "\"That’s my personal goal, and also to stay fit, that is really important. And then the goal with the team is to really show everybody what it is to play for United, and to get a positive vibe again around the team and the club.\"",
      "This season is important for De Ligt's future at Old Trafford. Jason Wilcox (director of football) will reportedly only make a solid assessment of a player after they have been afforded two seasons at United.",
      "That would be a logical approach because new signings should be given a season to settle into their new surroundings.",
      "De Ligt has spent 12 months in Manchester and his arrival coincided with the worst season at United for 51 years, so it was difficult for him to give the best account of himself.",
      "The good news is De Ligt made an impressive start to the new campaign against Arsenal on Sunday. Long may his that continue because United must qualify for European competition this season.",
      "Building a robust defensive foundation will be key to achieving that target, and centre-back is a strong area at United when Amorim's options are injury-free and available for selection.",
      "De Ligt, Yoro, Shaw, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are good options for the three starting positions. Shaw started on the left of the defence against Arsenal, but Martinez (currently recovering from a knee injury) and Heaven are also both best on that side.",
      "Yoro has the right side nailed down and it feels like the central role is between De Ligt and Maguire.",
      "Maguire might struggle to get back into the team if De Ligt consistently performs like he did against Arsenal.",

      "There were many positives to emerge from Manchester United's opening day performance against Arsenal, despite the 1-0 defeat.",
      "United looked sharper, more aggressive in their press, and their new-look frontline of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko looks like it will make a huge difference this season.",
      "But aside from the obvious goalkeeping howler from Altay Bayindir, United's lack of physicality and energy in midfield was a problem.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been moved into a deeper role this season to accommodate the new attacking trio but in order for United's talisman to truly thrive, he needs legs alongside him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "For all of Casemiro's experience from his excellent, trophy-laden career, that is not something the 33-year-old can now offer, which made the decision to start him at Old Trafford all the more surprising.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been linked with a move but he could prove to be expensive, given Brighton's history of being tough negotiators in the past across many examples of their transfer dealings.",
      "The likes of Joao Pedro, Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister, Ben White, Yves Bissouma and Marc Cucurella have all left the Amex Stadium for hefty fees to join other Premier League clubs in the recent past.",
      "As such, alternatives may be explored and United could do a lot worse than looking in the direction of Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller.",
      "The 24-year-old is a Germany international who helped his side win the DFB Pokal last season. His energy and calmness on the ball has been praised in the German media.",
      "Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger, who has played with Stiller at international level, said: \"I must say I am a bit of a fan of Angelo Stiller and I played against him in the Champions League.",
      "“I was impressed by his calmness on the ball. He was rarely nervous and has a big future ahead of him if he stays fit.”",
      "That big future has seen him linked with a move to Real Madrid and United would be hard pushed to find a better Baleba alternative out there.",
      "A £34million price tag has been suggested this summer and if that is to be the case, United could well land themselves a bargain if they choose to re-route their midfield search.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Manchester United have investigated how hundreds of supporters struggled to enter the stadium before the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "United have been criticised by fans who encountered problems at the turnstiles before the opening day fixture. The club has rolled out a new ticketing system for every supporter for 2025/26, meaning fans now enter Old Trafford using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology.",
      "All tickets are digital on a smartphone and downloaded to a device's wallet. The tickets are scanned to gain entry at the turnstiles, but mass confusion occurred before the Arsenal game when hundreds of supporters could not gain entry, and they were sent to the ticketing office by unprepared stewards.",
      "United have investigated the issue and are planning to provide additional fan-friendly assistance around Old Trafford on matchdays this season to prevent a repeat.",
      "The club introduced NFC tickets under instruction from the Premier League. United phased the introduction of the NFC tickets over the past year to help fans adapt to the change, but it appears some stewards on the turnstiles were unprepared to assist some supporters with the technology.",
      "The MEN has been told United recognises from the feedback that they must do more to make entry as smooth as possible, although the club claim the NFC system itself \"worked well\".",
      "United said flow rates were consistent with previous seasons, with 92 per cent of fans inside before kick-off, and 98 per cent of supporters by 16:35, but the supporters who were forced to endure long delays are not happy.",
      "One fan tweeted: \"Man Utd ticketing is a disgrace. Thousands of fans queuing at the ticketing office because the new NFC tickets are not working at the turnstiles! 10 minutes to kick off and massive queues everywhere.\"",
      "Another fan posted on Facebook: \"Manchester United excelled themselves today. Gave mum a plaque on her seat as she’s had her season ticket for 25 years, but then wouldn’t let her in.",
      "\"Ticket wouldn’t scan despite being downloaded exactly as instructed. And despite another fan helping her to download it again. Man on the turnstile was a useless ‘computer says no’ character and refused to let her in.",
      "\"He told my 77-year-old mum, who struggles walking, that she had to go to the ticket office where there was a queue a mile long. And this was after queuing in the car for over an hour to get to the stadium, which we live five miles from.",
      "\"She went home. I got to the seats only to find two other people sat in them! Not sure how they’d managed to get in, but I had to kick them out and now mum’s Platinum Season Ticket Holder seat is empty. Well done United. Well done. Hope you’re proud.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Tuesday, August 19.",
      "United kicked off their Premier League campaign with a narrow 1–0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were named in the starting XI, while Benjamin Sesko made his debut off the bench. However, it was Riccardo Calafiori who scored the decisive goal, handing Arsenal all three points.",
      "Attention now turns back to the transfer market, with United continuing their search for reinforcements to bolster Ruben Amorim’s squad. Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is a player the head coach is understood to admire, and he’s now firmly on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton follows reports that a move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the transfer deadline. United are said to be relaxed about the situation and open to revisiting the deal next year.",
      "Meanwhile, outgoings remain a key focus. Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Højlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia are all expected to leave the club before the window closes.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been linked with a move but he could prove to be expensive, given Brighton's history of being tough negotiators in the past across many examples of their transfer dealings.",

      "A £34million price tag has been suggested this summer and if that is to be the case, United could well land themselves a bargain if they choose to re-route their midfield search.",
      "The Telegraph claim Chelsea will finalise the signing of the winger once two other transfers are completed.",
      "Chelsea believe they can secure Garnacho for a bargain if they wait longer before making their move ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile, United are firm on getting a fair price for the academy graduate, valuing him higher than the £30million currently offered by their rivals.",
      "The Blues intend to step up their pursuit of Garnacho and RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons once they complete the sales of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson.",
      "It’s reported that the departure of one or both of the unsettled forwards could pave the way for a deal, making it likely a waiting game until that happens.",
      "Onana's former club Inter Milan are reportedly monitoring his situation at Old Trafford.",
      "According to The Sun, Inter are keen on re-signing the goalkeeper, who enjoyed great success during his previous spell in Italy.",
      "Onana, 29, remains a cult hero among Inter fans, having played a key role in their run to the 2023 Champions League final, where they were narrowly beaten by Manchester City.",

      "TEAMtalk understands that there is renewed belief Man United will step up their interest in Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Lammens during the final two weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Man United made a loan approach for Emi Martinez earlier this summer, but a move did not materialise.",
      "TEAMtalk add that, Bayindir’s mistake may prompt United to revisit the goalkeeper market and consider Lammens as their primary alternative to Martinez. The 23-year-old shot-stopper has also attracted interest from Inter Milan, but he reportedly has signaled a preference for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Jadon Sancho has rejected an offer from AS Roma after failing to reach an agreement on personal terms.",
      "The former England international is reportedly confident that other offers will come in. While there is interest from Turkey, including Besiktas, Sancho is not expected to consider those options until the main European transfer window closes.",
      "Roma are now looking at alternative options, while the Reds are hoping to find a suitor for Sancho, who doesn't even have a squad number this season.",

      "The Italian has already made it clear he intends to leave the French capital this summer after being frozen out. Donnarumma was a standout performer for Les Parisiens during their Champions League triumph last season, yet the signing of French international Lucas Chevalier has seemingly pushed him towards the exit.",
      "Now, both the red and blue sides of Manchester are believed to be circling. Ruben Amorim's squad urgently need a dependable presence between the posts, with Altay Bayindir's shortcomings highlighted in their narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, and Andre Onana guilty of repeated errors throughout the previous campaign.",

      "Manchester United's new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo gave plenty of reasons for United fans to be positive about this season, despite Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.",
      "That is the verdict of former Liverpool midfielder and BBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy who felt the pair gave United an extra physical edge at Old Trafford compared to last season.",

      "Bayindir started against the Gunners with United's regular No.1 Andre Onana having only recently recovered from a hamstring injury after missing the entirety of the Reds' pre-season schedule. Onana also made several errors last season although Amorim insisted after Sunday's game that the Cameroonian had not been dropped against Mikel Arteta's team.",

The Danish international was an unused substitute for United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina and was left out of their squad entirely for Sunday's season opener at home to Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund arrived in August 2023 but has struggled to become the consistent goalscorer Ruben Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag have badly needed. The former Atalanta forward scored 16 goals in his first season but only managed 10 last term.",

      "He was left out of Ruben Amorim's squad for Sunday's defeat to Arsenal and faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has received a response from Carlos Baleba on social media.",
      "United are reportedly interested in a swoop for Baleba this summer, as they aim to boost up their midfield before the transfer window shuts on September 1. The Seagulls reportedly value their midfielder at over £100million, with some reports hinting at a price tag closer to £120million.",
      "However, a recent report in The Athletic suggested that United have now 'ceased' their pursuit for Baleba for this summer. Despite that, the midfielder continues to be linked with a high-profile move to Old Trafford, although any potential transfer is unlikely to materialise until next year.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham are all reportedly targeting a move for Brentford captain Nathan Collins.",
      "The Daily Mail claim that interest in the 24-year-old centre-back is surging – although the Bees may well be highly reluctant to sell. It is claimed that United are keen on adding another defender and Collins may be the perfect candidate.",
      "If Manchester United needed proof that they've signed the right players this summer - Sunday's performance against Arsenal offered some positive indications.",
      "Time will tell if Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo go on to have successful careers at Old Trafford. The new double act were still part of a United side which slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal in their opening fixture of 2025/26.",
      "There was also a worrying repeat of United's inability to convert their chances, with Ruben Amorim hoping that Benjamin Sesko will fix that gaping hole in his team. And yet the Reds' overall performance against a likely Premier League title contender offers some room for optimism.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Ruben Amorim have praised Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha's early impact at Manchester United.",
      "The pair arrived at Old Trafford from Brentford and Wolverhampton Wanderers respectively in big-money deals this summer. Their signings were made with United looking to bolster an attack which scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "Neither player was able to get onto the scoresheet for Ruben Amorim's side during Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at M16. However, both played well in their first competitive game for the Reds with United overall putting on a much improved showing compared to what was often seen for much of last season under their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Read more here",
      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will depend on whether Amorim signs a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "Right now, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton on their books - but neither Amorim nor the fans seem convinced by any of their choices. Onana was periodically swapped out for Bayindir last season, and the duo conceded 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Manchester United have begun the 2025/26 season with a glaring weakness they are still some way short of solving.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side impressed in their 1-0 defeat against Arsenal on Sunday with United's new signings offering a positive impression. Both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo provided glimmers of hope for the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "United pressed impressively, looked more creative and did not let their heads drop after Altay Bayindir's inexplicable goalkeeping error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to put the Gunners ahead. And yet a costly mistake from their keeper has cost Amorim's team once more in a game where they deserved much more.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Gary Neville has raised concerns over Manchester United's goalkeeping situation after a mistake from Altay Bayindir against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "The Turkish shot-stopper flapped at a corner and Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori headed in from a yard out. It continued a worrying trend for Bayındır who was at fault for several goals last season under Ruben Amorim - the nadir being United's heavy 4-1 loss at Newcastle.",
      "Read more here",
      "Sky Italia report that AS Roma have held positive discussions with Man United regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "Meanwhile, Corriere dello Sport present a different view, stating that Sancho is taking 'a few more days' to decide on his future.",

      "United began their season with a 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal, with Riccardo Calafiori scoring the only goal of the match. Despite the loss, United put on a productive display for the home crowd and created several goalscoring opportunities. The improvement was clear, but Clattenburg believes the scoreline could have been different. For Arsenal’s goal, William Saliba seemed to wrestle with Mason Mount, preventing Altay Bayindir from properly punching away the cross.",
      "\"In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal’s goal, but when you watch it in slow motion you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball,\" the former referee said. \"PGMOL said they would punish more this type of challenge, but again they failed.\"",

I don't know where they are on PSR [the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules], but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan. The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters. You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina. They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man United need that.\"",

This interest remains and if United decide from now until the end of the window to invest on a goalkeeper - Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",
      "\"So could be a possibility. [Gianluigi] Donnarumma, they are aware of the situation but Man City are in concrete talks to sign him. So this is currently the situation for Man United but still, nothing imminent as of now.\""

      "It was nearly 8pm on Sunday and Ruben Amorim was only at the start of his post-match signing session outside the Stretford End tunnel.",
      "Hundreds of Manchester United supporters had waited patiently. They tend to, whatever the result and whatever the weather. Before full-time on the final day of last season, a couple of narky Mancunians asked some innocent fans why they were waiting for the lot that had just finished 15th. United are still 15th.",
      "Amorim was happier after a press conference that clocked in well at a meagre three-and-a-half minutes. He was incredulous that his choice of goalkeeper was questioned and the debrief centred so heavily on the 'keeping situation it was wrapped up quickly.",
      "Perhaps Amorim bristled at the lack of focus on United's performance. That they were better than Arsenal was undeniable and will have been reflected in any sensible piece filed from the press box in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.",
      "United were good and easy on the eye, which may have accounted for the large phalanx of fans outside. United were a chore to watch for almost the entirety of last season, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal, once such a sanctimonious club under Arsene Wenger that performances took precedence over results, have flipped it. They are a throwback to the George Graham era and actually revel in defending leads. This was their third 1-0 win at Old Trafford under Mikel Arteta and they have all been gritty performances.",
      "Winning ugly is an essential trait for title winners. United just need to win. Sunday marked their 19th home defeat since the start of the 2023-24 season.",
      "The players and staff still embarked on their dubious full-time lap of honour. There was appreciative applause from those who remained. It was noticeable that hardly any supporters left before the game had concluded.",
      "But the bottom line is United lost with a team littered with contentious calls: the goalkeeper, the left-sided centre back, the defensive midfielder, the right winger and the number seven.",
      "Amorim seemed to settle on a more becoming balance in pre-season, with Amad on the right. He was one of two players to start all five friendlies, which made Amad's demotion to the bench such a strategic shame.",
      "Suddenly, there were seven defensive players - a goalkeeper, three centre halves, two full backs, a defensive midfielder - picked for a home game. If Arsenal were at the races, they would have won at a canter.",
      "Instead, United did almost all of the running. Aside from the winning goal, Arsenal did not create a genuine chance worthy of the Match of the Day highlights until Bukayo Saka latched onto Martin Odegaard's disguised dink in the 92nd minute.",
      "Yet they did not need to. Including the seven minutes of added time, Arsenal defended their slender advantage for 84 minutes against a team that did not start a striker.",
      "United had £182.12million worth of strikers in the stadium: one in the directors' box, one on the bench and one on the pitch for the final 25 minutes. Warming up for Arsenal with strikerless sides against Everton and Fiorentina was a gear-shift from Amorim. He refused to consider that set-up in the run-in last season, despite Rasmus Hojlund's hopelessness in front of goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Hojlund after he strolled into the mixed zone in Chicago and outlined his intention to stay. Hojlund is small-fry for Amorim after he dispensed with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, but the United head coach has cut off his nose to spite his face. United's strongest performances in pre-season were with the Dane starting up front.",
      "There was still £193.5m worth of attackers in United's front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo complemented one another auspiciously and their willingness to get on the ball and put opponents on the back foot is not a sight United fans are accustomed to from attacking debutants.",
      "Antony scored on a victorious debut against Arsenal three years ago. He did little else and looked one-paced and one-dimensional during a self-indulgent hour. Cunha and Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but their movement, fluidity and presence in attacks bodes well. Amad offered another dimension when he was summoned early into the second half.",
      "Picking Mason Mount over a more suitable starter backfired in the Europa League final for Amorim and did so again. Mount is intense and competitive but he has not played properly well in the league two years into his United career yet Amorim is still crowbarring him into the team.",
      "It is impressionable of Amorim, too. Mount gained his place against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on the back of his two-goal cameo in the semi-final second leg. Against Everton in Atlanta, he emerged to score United's final goal of their tour and has since returned to the starting XI.",
      "Another blind spot is Altay Bayindir. United needed a new goalie this summer not to outright replace Andre Onana but to offer credible competition. Bayindir was fortunate to play for the club again after he punched thin air from Son Heung-min's corner at Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals eight months ago.",
      "\"Without VAR,\" an impassioned Amorim reminded us. \"With VAR, it's a foul.\" It wasn't.",
      "Then Amorim reminded us Bayindir was \"unbelievable\" in the FA Cup tie at Arsenal last season. He was after the superb game-changing denial of Odegaard from the penalty spot. Before that, he was constantly kicking the ball into touch.",
      "In the press conference room, Amorim eventually said he was \"happy\" with his three goalkeepers. Deep down, he can't be.",
      "Those United fans would also likely wait around outside the Stretford End for a goalkeeper signing.",

      "\"We were more aggressive than last year,\" Amorim said after the Arsenal match. \"We sprint more, we were more brave, we let one against one all the game. We pressed high.",

      "Once it was decided Onana was not ready to feature, Bayindir was a guaranteed starter, but a large portion of supporters would have preferred to see Tom Heaton given a chance instead.",
      "In a tense post-Arsenal press conference, Amorim was asked whether he considered starting Heaton and he snapped back: \"Why? He [Bayindir] suffered a goal like this where?",
      "\"Without VAR. With VAR [at Tottenham], is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",

      "Amorim continued: \"I'm happy with the three goalkeepers. He [Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed. That is my feeling when I see the play.",
      "\"You choose to push a player [out of the way] or to get the ball in that moment. He needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and will let the ball pass.\"",
      "In a way, it was admirable for Amorim to staunchly defend his goalkeeper in a short press conference, although he must privately concede that Bayindir is not good enough and should not be starting games for United.",
      "Bayindir is not aggressive enough at corners and fails to command his area. He made the same mistake against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup in December last season and struggles to claim aerial deliveries.",
      "The Turkish international is meek when set-pieces are taken. And if that wasn't bad enough, he attempted to clear the corner with his left glove, which was the wrong hand to punch the ball with.",
      "From a technical standpoint, it was a shocking mistake from Bayindir and it cost United on the opening day of the Premier League season. Amorim gave Bayindir a second chance after a similar mistake against Spurs, but it's obvious to anyone with eyes that he needs to be replaced as second choice.",
      "Heaton has been underused during his second stint at his boyhood club. He is no spring chicken at 39 years old, but would he have conceded from that corner? It seems unlikely Heaton would have been so passive.",
      "Amorim seemed offended to be asked whether he'd considered Heaton to start against Arsenal, however, most would agree he would be a better option when Onana is unavailable to start.",
      "Bayindir is so unconvincing that he even skewed a simple pass to Bruno Fernandes when United were frantically trying to launch the ball forward in the final seconds of added time.",
      "The good news is that Onana is set to be available to start against Fulham at Craven Cottage this weekend. It says a lot about Bayindir that fans are desperate to see Onana play again when he starts instead.",
      "Amorim must rethink his cup competition policy of giving opportunities to Bayindir because he will continue to cost United this season.",

      "Rashford departed his childhood club to join the Spanish giants on loan for the 2025/26 campaign, but he still felt compelled to share his views on the reconstruction task facing Amorim at Old Trafford. The attacker delivered a scathing critique of United, arguing they cannot shelter behind the justification of being a club in transition.",
      "\"To start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it,\" Rashford told Gary Lineker last week on The Rest is Football Podcast. \"This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. We've had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "\"This season I think the manager to watch is the United manager,\" Neville said. \"All eyes are on him. Can he do it? He had a horrible start to his United career. He didn't want the job part way through last season.\"",
      "Presenter David Jones interjected and said: \"Do you not think because of that he gets this season, whatever happens?\"",
      "\"Oh no I don't think it'll be that easy,\" Neville added. \"I think if he's down in the bottom half of the table he'll be under massive pressure.\"",
      "Jones then asked: \"What about what Marcus Rashford said the other day, that Manchester United have got to come up with a plan and stick with it somewhere, haven't they?\"",
      "Neville responded by waving his hand dismissively, and said: \"Let's ignore that, because I don't want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight.",

      "These comments are a damning reflection of Neville's opinion on Rashford's future at Old Trafford, as many believe the Manchester-born star will leave United for good soon enough.",
      "Continuing the discussion of Amorim's United, Neville gave his first impressions of the newly-formed squad that lost to Arsenal on Sunday. He said: \"Yesterday was the first time I watched that formation out on Old Trafford, where I thought, 'Right, we've got a chance here, that worked.'",
      "\"He'd brought in a few different players, he'd got [Mason] Mount back, introduced Luke Shaw at left centre-back, that helped and I think it was the first time, it's a difficult, rare system, it needs specialists, but when you saw [Matheus] Cunha play, saw Mount play, saw Shaw at left centre-back – there was a balance! Casemiro looked a better player all of a sudden! Just straight away he looked a better player.\"",
      "Interrupting with a laugh, Jamie Carragher added: \"It was one game!\"",
      "Despite the opening day defeat, a buoyed United will believe their first points of the new season won't be far away, and they continue their Premier League campaign on Sunday against Fulham at Craven Cottage.",

Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked. \"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.\"",
      "Arsenal scored against United from two corners in their 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium last season. Amorim felt United's set-up was naive against a team renowned for their set-piece prowess but also appeared to question the rules.",
      "\"I think you can watch the goal, I think [you’re] allowed to do a lot of things,\" Amorim added. \"In the corners we need to do the same. But when you touch the goalkeeper that way, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not to push players, or he chooses to push the players and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules, if it’s allowed we need to do the same thing.",
      "\"I’m saying that you choose to push a player or to get the ball in that moment. So he chooses to get the ball but he gets pushed and cannot defend himself. That is my feeling when I see the play but we need to do the same thing.\"",
      "Onana was not included in the United squad as academy goalie Dermot Mee assisted Bayindir and Heaton in the warm up. Onana is poised to return at Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United explored the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa on loan earlier in the summer but a new goalkeeper has never been a priority and United could end the transfer window without reinforcing that department. Amorim eventually said he was \"happy with the three goalkeepers\".",
      "\"I didn’t drop Onana from the squad,\" Amorim stressed. \"I didn't drop one of the other two from the squad, it’s a case of not putting Andre Onana with just one week, without seeing a game, without training. Tom and Altay in pre-season did a good job.\"",
      "Amorim was coy on Rasmus Hojlund's future after he was omitted from the matchday squad. United are looking to sell Hojlund two years on from buying him from Atalanta in a £72million deal.",
      "\"He’s [got] to fight for the place,\" Amorim explained. \"We are going to see what happens in the market. [He has] different characteristics and Rasmus has the same characteristics as Benjamin Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",

      "Manchester United showed signs of improvement in their defeat by Arsenal, but Ruben Amorim's side still have plenty of work to do in the transfer window.",
      "United fans saw all three of their new forwards during their narrow loss to the Gunners, with Matheus Cunha in particular earning plaudits for the club in his league debut. It wasn't enough for United to come away with a share of the points, though, as a mistake from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir allowed Riccardo Calafiori to score the game's only goal.",
      "Off the pitch, United are still looking to shift several players deemed surplus to requirements and address their goalkeeper situation. However, the club have faced a few setbacks in its transfer plans.",
      "Roma have reportedly offered around £20million for winger Jadon Sancho. The England international has expressed a desire to leave Old Trafford after Chelsea opted not to make Sancho's loan move permanent.",
      "Reports in Italy have claimed that United have already reached an agreement with Roma regarding an initial loan deal with an obligation to buy. However, Corriere dello Sport reports that Sancho is yet to commit to joining Roma.",
      "Manager Gian Piero Gasperini is said to have spoken with Sancho about his plans for the winger to be part of his team. Meanwhile, Roma are also working on a move for Aston Villa's Leon Bailey.",
      "The Daily Mail has reported that Sancho's wages have delayed negotiations with Roma. Besiktas, managed by former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, are reportedly interested in Sancho this summer.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly a potential target for Fulham, but the striker is keen to rebuild his career away from the Premier League if he does leave United. The 22-year-old has previously voiced his desire to stay at the club, but was left out of the matchday squad for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "The Daily Mail stated that Hojlund has emerged as a possible target for Fulham as striker Rodrigo Muniz is wanted by Atalanta. However, the Whites face competition from AC Milan, who have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m, with Hojlund said to favour a move abroad.",
      "Milan sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed the club's interest in the United striker, as he told Mediaset: \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.\"",
      "However, The Mirror reports that United's hopes of Milan meeting their valuation for Hojlund partly rest on Dusan Vlahovic's future. The Juventus striker is regarded as Milan's top target, but the club are yet to agree on a fee or contract, though a positive development may derail Hojlund's chances of joining Milan.",
      "Amorim made the bold call to pick Bayindir ahead of Onana against Arsenal but it was a decision that highlighted the team’s issues at goalkeeper. United have been linked with a move for PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma, but Antwerp's Senne Lammens is an alternative target.",
      "The 23-year-old established himself as the Belgian club's first-choice last season. Het Laatste Nieuws, who credit United with an interest, has previously claimed that it is \"crystal clear\" Lammens will be leaving the club this summer. Antwerp have already signed his replacement and placed a £17.2m price tag on the goalkeeper.",
      "However, Amorim's side may be dealt a blow in their hopes of securing Lammens' services, with the Telegraph reporting that Inter are pushing to sign the shot-stopper. Belgian outlet HLN claims that the Italian giants view Lammens as a potential successor to 36-year-old Yann Sommer.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is among the several players who informed the club of their desire to leave United. The winger memorably shared his frustration after being named on the bench for the Europa League final last season.",
      "Garnacho, 21, is a target for Chelsea and is claimed to have already agreed personal terms. However, United are demanding around £50m for the highly-rated winger. The club believe Garnacho’s value should reflect the £52m Chelsea received for selling Noni Madueke to Arsenal.",
      "While United are awaiting an offer from Chelsea, there has been a sign of the current fan feeling towards Garnacho. On Sunday, a portrait of Garnacho near Old Trafford was defaced by what appeared to be an 'X' drawn over the Argentinian's face.",

      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did not play as much on the front foot as in pre-season and had little hassle from Arsenal's forwards in open play. Switched to the left after Luke Shaw was substituted. 6",

      "Pitted directly against Viktor Gyokeres, De Ligt's own frame has been the topic of debate in the past but the Arsenal striker appeared overweight. 6",

      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Offered Mbeumo ample support and got into the box to provide some crosses that came to nought. Made way for Amad before the hour. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Arsenal could have steamrollered Casemiro but they let him off. The Brazilian still merely existed in an area that Declan Rice bossed. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Scored United's goals against Arsenal last term but started badly and did not improve enough. Too rash with and without the ball. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struck the post after a positive charge towards the Arsenal area at 0-1 but struggled to maintain that level of threat in the second half. Rightly booked. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Played one memorable pass but that was about it from a player whose best work is almost always off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with him. 5",

      "Continued his promising pre-season form and had the measure of Calafiori. Had shots at goal but none threatening enough. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes ordered his daughter to remove an Arsenal shirt moments before the Sunday's Premier League clash.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side hosted the north London outfit at Old Trafford on Sunday as both teams kicked off their fresh campaigns. United ultimately suffered defeat, with Riccardo Calafiori's first-half header clinching triumph for the Gunners.",
      "That outcome would hardly have improved Scholes' disposition after an awkward opening few moments. His daughter Alicia, 24, captured her father's reaction as she entered the sitting room sporting an Arsenal jersey.",
      "And Scholes, 50, delivered a sharp response to her wardrobe selection, promptly declaring: \"Take it off.\" She swiftly declined that demand.",
      "Alicia represents one of three offspring that Scholes shares with spouse Claire Froggatt. They also have 25-year old-son Arron, alongside Aiden, 20.",
      "Alicia is presently pursuing a netball career. She features for London Pulse in the Netball Super League whilst also representing England at international level.",
      "Scholes will undoubtedly hope that Alicia switches her loyalties in the near future. He has previously expressed optimism regarding an improved campaign at Old Trafford this season after their woeful displays last term.",
      "Speaking before Sunday's season opener, he remarked: \"It's a tricky one after being so bad last year. Now seasons can change. We saw last year with Nottingham Forest, it doesn't have to take five to 10 years to get back where you want to be.",
      "\"Although it is looking better, I still think there are issues with the team. The midfield, I know we don't want to go through it again. But, top six. I think top six would be more than acceptable.",
      "\"As much as you don't want to say that, I always think Manchester United should aim for the very best and aim for the highest. I am just not sure. I think there are too many good teams now.",
      "\"I think Liverpool, Chelsea and City are all on the up. Arsenal [as well], I did not even mention Aston Villa, Newcastle. I think there is a lot of competition now to get top six.\"",
      "United return to action at the weekend when they make the trip to Fulham on Sunday afternoon. Scholes will be hoping that Alicia doesn't opt to wear a Cottagers jersey this time round.",

      "The 22-year-old was omitted from Ruben Amorim's squad for their first match of the season against Arsenal on Sunday as he continues linked with a move away. Last month, the Portuguese head coach refused to guarantee Hojlund's future and, on Friday, declined to confirm whether he wanted to keep the Denmark international.",
      "Despite uncertainty over his future, Hojlund made it clear during United's pre-season tour of the United States that he was prepared to fight for a place in the team. \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes.\"",

      "The improvement was clear, but Clattenburg believes the scoreline could have been different. For Arsenal’s goal, William Saliba seemed to wrestle with Mason Mount, preventing Altay Bayindir from properly punching away the cross.",
      "\"In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal’s goal, but when you watch it in slow motion you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball,\" the former referee said. \"PGMOL said they would punish more this type of challenge, but again they failed.\"",
      "PGMOL is the body responsible for refereeing games in English professional association football and employs the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) to assist the on-field referee with major match decisions including goals, penalties, direct red cards, and mistaken identity.",
      "This month, PGMOL chief Howard Webb revealed that referees will award more penalties for holding in this season. \"We have to identify those situations that do fall in line with the feedback that we had, that there are just a few too many examples of players clearly pulling people back, impacting their ability to move to the ball or some clear extreme actions are not being penalised,\" said Webb.",
      "\"They're the ones I expect us to catch. Therefore, I would expect this time next year to have been a few more penalties given for holding offences than what we've seen this year. But not a huge swing of the pendulum because that's really difficult to sustain over a period of time.\"",

      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has received a response from Carlos Baleba on social media.",
      "United are reportedly interested in a swoop for Baleba this summer, as they aim to boost up their midfield before the transfer window shuts on September 1. The Seagulls reportedly value their midfielder at over £100million, with some reports hinting at a price tag closer to £120million.",
      "However, a recent report in The Athletic suggested that United have now 'ceased' their pursuit for Baleba for this summer. Despite that, the midfielder continues to be linked with a high-profile move to Old Trafford, although any potential transfer is unlikely to materialise until next year.",
      "Baleba's compatriot, Mbeumo, made a positive impression in his first appearance for United during Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford. \"It's not the start we wanted but we stay positive for the next one,\" he said on Instagram in reaction to the game.",
      "\"Thank you for the huge support today from the start til the end. You deserved so much more today.\"",
      "And Mbeumo's post received a 'like' from Baleba, indicating at least the two players have a positive relationship. Despite the swirling rumours around his future, Baleba was included in the starting line-up for Brighton's Premier League opener against Fulham, which ended in a 1-1 draw.",
      "Following that match, the 21-year-old took to social media to share a series of photos with the caption: \"Just me doing the thing I love most.",
      "\"Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "Baleba's caption seems to be a nod to remarks made by Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler prior to the match - when questioned about the midfielder's future. When asked if he believes that Baleba will stay put at Brighton, their head coach responded: \"I am very, very confident.",
      "\"I didn't see any change, he's only changed his hair. I think that's the change he's made in the last two weeks. But overall, he seems to be in a really good place, he's enjoying it with his teammates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player. I didn't see any big changes and he's an option to start.\"",

      "These are the known active buy-back options Premier League clubs hold over sold players.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsey\nA significant knee injury has limited Ramsey to 18 appearances for Burnley since he made his £14m move in August 2023.",
      "“It feels so amazing to be back on the pitch, it feels like a dream,” he said after making a six-minute cameo in the club’s penultimate game of their promotion season.",
      "Unai Emery’s presence has likely contributed to Aston Villa adopting the more European approach of baking buy-back clauses into many a sale, especially those of young, homegrown players whose development could be accelerated by regular minutes elsewhere.",
      "But they will not be cashing in their Ramsey receipt any time soon, although his long-awaited return might prompt them to keep tabs again.",
      "",
      "Diego Moreira\nIt seems fairly pointless for Chelsea to insert a buy-back clause into any sale they make to Strasbourg, a club with whom they share owners and have loaned or transferred ten players since summer 2023.",
      "But when Diego Moreira was shipped across to France for £1.7m he arrived safe in the knowledge Chelsea at least had an eye on his future progress. Two goals and seven assists en route to Champions League qualification did not sufficiently move them.",
      "",
      "Bobby Clark\nOne of Jurgen Klopp’s 42 children at Liverpool, the son of Lee made waves at Anfield including playing 48 minutes as a substitute in the 2024 League Cup final, before unseating Trent Alexander-Arnold as the club’s youngest European goalscorer and guaranteeing himself a future mural in the process.",
      "Liverpool were loathe to lose Clark but, as ever with transfer negotiations, ensured the situation was weighted ludicrously in their favour when the inevitable happened.",
      "As well as a £10m fee which constituted one of the highest ever paid in Austrian league history, Liverpool got Salzburg to agree to a 17.5% sell-on clause and buy-back option.",
      "It remained untouched through a season which featured one goal, two assists and a Pep Lijnders sacking in 25 appearances.",
      "",
      "Ben Gannon Doak\nLiverpool have always enjoyed chucking buy-back clauses into their player sales without it ever really seeming likely they would be triggered. But this summer feels different – at least they hope so.",
      "Perhaps Doak will follow the same path as Rhian Brewster before him in struggling under the weight of expectation and injuries. He would not even be the first Liverpool forward whose rise stops and irreversible fall starts at Bournemouth; the tale of Jordon Ibe is a warning.",
      "But Liverpool have been remarkably eager to let the world know how highly they rate a player given four starts and six sub appearances in three years at Anfield, with a decent Middlesbrough loan in between.",
      "Bournemouth felt compelled to hand over £20m and £5m in add-ons after scanning that CV; Liverpool were never going to sanction a sale unless it outlined in writing an opportunity to bring him back.",
      "",
      "Jarell Quansah\nThe buy-back clause has become a prerequisite to bring Liverpool to the negotiating table for their homegrown products – or at least those plucked from other academies at a young age.",
      "Harvey Elliott has had such a premium built into his asking price this summer, with Liverpool willing to accept £40m if the future option was included and £50m if not.",
      "It is unknown whether Leverkusen faced the same obstacle when they came calling for Quansah but the Germans seemed content to agree to whatever demands were laid out in front of them.",
      "A £30m deal with £5m in add-ons gives Liverpool, at worst, a sizeable fee for a player with 58 senior career appearances, with the best-case scenario handing them control over a substantial centre-half asset if Quansah comes good with some Bundesliga seasoning.",
      "",
      "Gavin Bazunu\n“All of them are fantastic players. Southampton bought really good players,” said Pep Guardiola.",
      "“They could stay one to two years. They want Premier League, so after agreement with the clubs we have a buyback on all of them so just in case they explode we have a chance to get them back.”",
      "Chelsea soon eliminated any temptation Manchester City might have had to take Romeo Lavia straight back but three Etihad academy graduates remained at Southampton after joining in summer 2022.",
      "Bazunu has kept 16 clean sheets and conceded 117 goals in 80 games for Saints, spending some of this past season on loan to Standard Liege. It does not scream Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Juan Larios\nNor does 153 minutes in three seasons on the south coast.",
      "",
      "Sam Edozie\nOr a loan at Anderlecht last season.",
      "",
      "Jacob Wright\nFour substitute appearances amounting to 61 appearances across the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup prevented Wright from joining the Manchester City transfer cheat code list but it was still a feat to extract £2.3m from Championship side Norwich for the inexperienced midfielder.",
      "Wright impressed enough on loan at Carrow Road to earn a permanent move which the Canaries might end up paying more for in add-ons.",
      "Manchester City will be keeping tabs in case the 19-year-old shines and their buy-back or sell-on clauses come into action.",
      "",
      "James McAtee\nPerhaps burned by Cole Palmer – and certainly finding Nottingham Forest more amenable to such clauses than Chelsea would ever have been – Manchester City put the usual fine print into the £30m sale of James McAtee.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s side have a sell-on and buy-back clause on a player the manager says “has the potential to be with Man City,” but who simply “wants more minutes and it’s fair enough”.",
      "",
      "Willy Kambwala\nThere are few areas in which Manchester United have definitely improved their operations over the last few years, but they are absolutely better at engineering more advantageous sales.",
      "Kambwala played ten games for Erik ten Hag through an injury crisis in 2023/24 but remained low down the centre-half pecking order and had rejected a new contract offer so the teenager was sold to Villarreal for a deal worth £9.6m, with a healthy sell-on clause and three-year buy-back option.",
      "After playing a decent number of games to help Villarreal finish fifth and secure Champions League qualification, Kambwala might end up receiving a couple of calls from some familiar Manchester-based numbers soon.",
      "",
      "Facundo Pellistri\nIt was a similar story with Pellistri, for whom Panathinaikos could end up paying £6.8m to essentially borrow if he comes good in Greece.",
      "Manchester United hold a mammoth 45% sell-on clause but also another buy-back option which lasts for three years. The forward scoring four goals in 36 appearances in his debut campaign for the Super League runners-up is unlikely to see it activated.",
      "",
      "Hannibal Mejbri\nGary Neville would absolutely like to see Hannibal lecture the Manchester United squad on the importance of kicking Liverpool players but that violent cameo ended up being the highlight of the midfielder’s 13-game Old Trafford career.",
      "It could be revisited down the line as the Red Devils this time negotiated a £9.4m fee and 50% sell-on clause to go with their now standard buy-back option. Manchester United could have a hell of a team one day if all these offloaded talents realise their potential simultaneously.",
      "",
      "Mason Greenwood\nAs the Daily Telegraph reported in July 2024:",
      "‘There is also a buy-back option in the agreement with Marseille. These are fairly routine nowadays where the sale of academy graduates or young talents are concerned but, given Greenwood’s history, the decision to include a buy-back clause could be perceived as somewhat contentious.",
      "‘Nonetheless, Telegraph Sport understands there is no expectation or intention of Greenwood coming back in the future and that, if the clause does signify the door remains ajar for the player down the line, it is very much the slimmest of cracks. The prospect of it being activated is considered very low.’",
      "A huge sell-on clause entitling Manchester United to 50% of any profit Marseille make on £26.7m signing Greenwood is far more relevant, especially if Liverpool act on their reported interest. Which they absolutely shouldn’t and won’t but still.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid are ‘close’ to signing a Liverpool star, while Fabrizio Romano claims two more Reds stars are set to leave.",
      "Jacob Ramsey is the second-biggest Academy sale in Villa history, but Chelsea remain the kings of such sales despite letting No 1) go for free.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly close to making a huge profit on Ben Doak as the Scotland international closes in on a move to Premier League side Bournemouth.",
      "Former Man Utd striker Cristiano Ronaldo could help the Red Devils land a huge windfall this summer if Al-Nassr sign Mason Greenwood.",
      "Man Utd will reportedly land 50 per cent of any fee Marseille bring in for Mason Greenwood this summer amid interest from Saudi Arabian clubs.",
      "Man Utd could be set to receive £30m as Saudi Arabian side Al-Ahli have launched a £60m offer to sign Mason Greenwood, according to reports."

      "Manchester United ‘can afford’ top midfield target Carlos Baleba this summer and ‘could revive a deal’ for the Brighton star despite reports claiming they’ve walked away from his possible transfer.",
      "The Red Devils have held talks over a move for Baleba via intermediaries and then directly with Brighton this month to sound them out over a deal, but with the Seagulls wanting £100m+, The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed on Friday that United had decided not to push ahead with talks.",
      "‘Manchester United are not planning to proceed with a move for Carlos Baleba before the transfer window closes,’ he wrote.",
      "‘Moving to Old Trafford appeals to Baleba so personal terms would have presented no problem — and the Cameroon international is prepared to keep pushing, even if it means waiting until the future.",
      "‘That does not suggest he is unhappy at Brighton and the dialogue has been cordial, with United respecting their stance.’",
      "But The Standard, while offering no more information besides, claim ‘a deal could be revived’ for the 21-year-old, and football finance expert Dan Plumley insists United “can afford him if they want him”.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “Ultimately, and we’ve said this before with other players this summer, Man United can afford him if they want him.",
      "“They have got options to draw upon. There’s a credit facility, a revolving one that we think has been drawn down.",
      "“We’ve seen the way they’ll stagger instalments for other players that they’ve brought in as well.",
      "“In terms of general affordability, the answer is still yes. I think the interesting thing on the fee is if it is going to be £100m or in and around that figure, then it probably won’t happen this summer.",
      "“That would be the other way to look at it, because that then is a significant outlay on top of what they’ve already spent this summer.",
      "“If the fee’s gonna be that high, I think that probably means they wouldn’t look at him this summer, but if they think a deal can be done further down the line, next year seems more likely.",
      "“Can they afford him this summer? Yes, in the bigger picture, but £100m now, given where the window’s at, probably not.”",
      "Manchester United have given up on signing Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, per David Ornstein.",
      "A Manchester United legend has told the club they “can’t pay” £100million for a “kid’ they don’t know “which way he’s going to go,” but the key to the transfer ...",
      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he is “very confident” that Carlos Baleba will stay amid interest from Manchester United, as he revealed the “only change” the midfielder has made.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports."

      "And the reigning Serie A champions have held talks with Manchester United on Monday over a move for Rasmus Hojlund, who didn’t make the squad for the Red Devils’ opening day defeat to Arsenal.",

      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Napoli had direct contact with Man United today following Romelu Lukaku’s injury as he’ll be out more than 3 months. Napoli asked for loan deal conditions for Rasmus Højlund. Man United want to keep Joshua Zirkzee, no talks despite links today. Clear plan by Rúben Amorim.’",

      "Andre Onana was also left out of the squad against Arsenal, with Altay Bayindir starting and costing the Red Devils a point to pile the pressure on the goalkeeping department at Old Trafford.",
      "Pressed on Onana’s absence, Amorim confirmed after the game: “No, no he’s not injured, he’s recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.”",
      "Despite this, Romano claimed Onana’s “feeling” is that he was left out of United’s squad because he is “not at 100% form yet”.",
      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“And he accepted the decision. He doesn’t believe it’s to do with transfers. Also because Onana is not in any active talks with another club.",
      "“There was some interest in Saudi at the beginning of the window. He accepted the decision of Amorim but it’s another story next week.”",
      "But the Cameroon may be offered the chance of an exit according to The Sun, who claim former club Inter ‘are interested in re-signing a player who was a massive success in Italy’, whom United signed from them for £46m in the summer of 2023.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Inter chiefs believe Onana – who joined United after that defeat in Istanbul in a £47million deal – would be open-minded to a return to the San Siro.",

      "But Hackett, a former FIFA referee and ex-PGMOL chief, insists Hooper was right not to give the spot kick.",
      "The former referee told Football Insider: “There is no doubt that the defender made contact with Cunha. The problem here is that the player is already falling down backwards and was searching for a penalty kick.",
      "“The referee is spot on. VAR isn’t going to get involved because it’s not a clear and obvious error. Players often exaggerate their fall when a foul has taken place, and that exaggeration often makes the referee not give it.",
      "“Saliba has made a genuine attempt for the ball, and Cunha is already on his way down. He’s not even facing the goal – why? There are lots of questions to be asked here.",

      "He added: “I was less than satisfied with the referee’s performance. When you’ve got fouls taking place, but the referee is completely ignoring them without a signal of advantage, it opens up the question of whether he’s seen it or not.",
      "“Hooper’s approach was, ‘I’ll keep the game going. I’ll stay low-key’, but in doing so, the game at times was bubbling. The discipline of both sets of players was good so that helped him.",
      "“But, he was inconsistent and lacked authority, lacked an understanding of when to put his foot on the ball. It was an indifferent performance, and he was lucky not to have a mass confrontation.",
      "“Loose and inconsistent. I was surprised that he was appointed for this game because I know the history between these teams. As a former boss, you always put on your strongest referee, who would maintain control.",

      "15) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National. Given Liverpool face Newcastle next Monday night, it seems most likely that something will happen after that.",

      "14) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player has not taken it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media. Ooh, you’re hard.",

      "12) 🔽 Rico Lewis – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\n“I think he is going to stay. I think. He told me that. But maybe tomorrow it changes.” Lewis seems very keen to stay but if City decide they want to cash in, there’s little the academy graduate can do. The right-back started at Wolves on Saturday, though, so he’s certainly not surplus to requirements.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found.",
      "",
      "10) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "9) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Nkunku in as part of the deal. It is clear Chelsea need to shift some deadwood before they can sign more forwards.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nHojlund was left out of the United squad beaten by Arsenal which suggests something is afoot, most likely involving Milan. “Hojlund is a good option for us,” said their sporting director Igli Tare on Sunday. “We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.” United want around £30million; Milan would obviously prefer to pay less or take the Denmark striker on loan first.",

      "7) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG.

It was just a coincidence that it occurred around the same time an £8.6million offer arrived from Galatasaray. If City have decided they want Donnarumma, then Ederson will be off. They want double the amount offered by the Turkish but the expectation is that a compromise can be reached.",

The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge.",

      "The Swede’s Arsenal debut lasted all of 60 minutes with him making little impact on the match, causing a mass pile-on from some harsher sections of the media.",
      "But while plenty have given him the benefit of the doubt given it was only one game, Leboeuf has told Mikel Arteta to change his tactics to suit Gyokeres or risk having a Hojlund situation in his hands.",

      "“But today, he was nowhere near it, because it wasn’t at the same level of music as the others are playing. The others were playing a kind of sloppy but slow-motion game while he was trying to get more vertical – one ball, one opportunity, one cross. It never happened.”",

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "19) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "18) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "12=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "12=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "12=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",

A related issue or concern is why did Amorim field a team with no natural striker, even though the striker or rather lack of an effective striker has plagued United for some time. There is no excuse for this strategic shortcoming, exacerbated by the fact that we were playing against Arsenal. Did Arsenal bench Gyokeres? No he started. Did Liverpool bench Ekitike? Of course not.",

I won’t speak for every Gooner, but having watched Saliba, Gabriel & Raya for a few years now, I never felt worried that Utd would score. I was only concerned that Cunha would eventually flop his way into a cheap penalty.",

Its been a long time in the league, and they hate it. Good. I don’t want you to like us. I want you to hate us.

Keane and Vieira retired several years ago now everyone, games between these two sides simply don’t hold the same significance anymore.",

Sure, they didn’t look as clueless as the majority of last season, but other than Cunha’s shot that was well saved, they didn’t really trouble Arsenal. Sure they had a lot of possession and the stats will tell you they had a lot of shots on goal, but the vast majority were very easily dealt with.",

Maybe Janelt when he returns from injury could play that role but either way it’s a step down",

      "",
      "Sunderland\nIt is a phrase Regis Le Bris applied liberally to this Sunderland team in pre-season, the need to “build connections”.",
      "With eight debutants and a manager new to the Premier League, but also a fanbase still learning that excitement and expectation is to be encouraged rather than immediately extinguished, it was a requirement if they were to hold their own in the top flight.",
      "This is a different club to that which last graced and disgraced the top flight but the memories will have lingered. While no member of this squad can be tarred with the same brush of failure that swept Sunderland into the Championship eight years ago, many associated with the club will have recalled the misery of their last Premier League season.",
      "They were erased in 90 minutes which suggested Sunderland can break the curse of the promoted team.",
      "Across the last two seasons, Ipswich, Leicester, Southampton, Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton took anywhere between six and 11 games to record their first victory en route to heading back down from whence they came. In total, they won just 17 of 192 matches against non-promoted sides. West Ham at home was a gimme of an opening fixture but Sunderland did look far better prepared in comparison against precisely the sort of team they should be aiming to pull in and overtake.",
      "And the points about tactical adaptability and versatility are especially apt when promoted sides have been used as a vehicle for career progression in recent years. “We won’t play like Guardiola or De Zerbi, because we are Sunderland, and I am Regis Le Bris,” the Frenchman said last season. Both seem well-equipped for the challenges ahead together.",
      "",
      "Manchester City\nIt could be argued that Manchester City did not have a single unqualified success of a transfer window for at least a couple of years. They were underpinned by brilliant coaching and players for long enough to suffer a few market mistakes in succession, but it was always likely to catch them eventually.",
      "A mid-season scare triggered an extravagant January spend which spilled over into the summer. It turns out investing more than £100m on defenders and almost as much in both midfield and attack in a single calendar year, with £27m and a Marcus Bettinelli reserved between the sticks, can cure any and all ailments.",
      "That will prompt chequebook manager accusations and talk of 115 charges but Pep Guardiola will not care. He is a phenomenal coach of brilliant players and Manchester City appear to have recruited at least a handful more in 2025 to sort out a whole load of problems.",
      "It is the sort of indulgence few can afford but a nation state absolutely can.",
      "",
      "Federico ‘Divock’ Chiesa\nWhile Arne Slot spoke of “the fine-tuning we still need to find defensively”, the immediacy with which a repurposed Liverpool attack clicked and coruscated against Bournemouth was encouraging but unsurprising.",
      "It is possible to rely on instinct and pure technique to find solutions to problems at one end; the other requires time, patience and repetition to hone and perfect.",
      "Four debutants is as many as a reigning champion has ever named in their starting line-up of a Premier League opening weekend game. The accepted wisdom is never to change a winning team but Liverpool did so out of necessity and used that opportunity to build from a position of power.",
      "This is basically a new side, albeit with many familiar composite parts. Trent Alexander-Arnold was uniquely critical to how Liverpool defended and attacked on and off the ball. An element of unpredictability and instability when moving away from that is inevitable even when the most important gear in their midfield machine becomes available and players build fitness and rhythm.",
      "Yet it was the only first-team addition of last season’s £10m spend who stepped up to spare some rather more uncomfortable questions being asked of this summer’s £300m binge.",
      "Only in two of his previous Premier League appearances has Chiesa been given more than the eight minutes afforded to him to make a difference against Bournemouth. Injuries have hampered the Italian but it did always seem a largely pointless, opportunistic signing for such a strong frontline.",
      "This summer has, however, opened up an unlikely space for a wildcard forward beloved by the fanbase and popular within the squad, the sort crucial to any successful team. When the main cast members falter and fade, the ensemble needs to be trusted and Chiesa has that now.",
      "Even Darwin Nunez, who never convinced and was deemed dispensable at the right price, could list a number of game-changing moments he produced when called upon. No-one will ever play the role better than Divock Origi but that final roll of the dice, fifth and final substitution suggested Chiesa can give a passable impression, which is all Liverpool need from him as a £10m forward surrounded by those signed for far more.",
      "Those dissenting voices doubting Liverpool’s title defence can and should still be heard. Many aspects of the overall plan made little sense on the pitch and Slot will know that flexibility in his ideas is necessary. A title-winning campaign should not look the same at the end as it did at the beginning because lessons are learned and acted upon; last season started with Jarell Quansah at centre-half so the coach has earned a certain level of faith in his ability.",
      "The hope will be that when the time comes to review this season, Chiesa’s bench-based brilliance has become frequent enough to be no surprise. But after a year of struggles and setbacks, he earned that one spell in the spotlight.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo\nThe most possession Nottingham Forest had in any Premier League game last season was 55% against Brentford at home; they lost 2-0 and Nuno spoke post-match about finding “better solutions”.",
      "With the same amount of the ball against the same opponent at the same venue – and with nine of the same players starting – three months later, Forest converted their territorial advantage into what was at times total dominance.",
      "That is testament to a tactical adaptability many felt was beyond Nuno, who had only previously coached 11 of his 71 Premier League wins with at least as much of the ball.",
      "The difficult second album has at least started with a compelling track.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo\nBournemouth were a compelling mirror image of Liverpool as a side finding its feet defensively while retaining an innate ability to hurt any opponent going forward.",
      "It has been a difficult summer and a slight deviation from their stated stepping-stone plan of never sanctioning more than two first-team sales in the same season. A new keeper, centre-half and left-back might have been grateful for an easier first assignment.",
      "But in basically bringing those pre-season shooting videos to life, Semenyo proved that his new contract might have been the best possible business Bournemouth could have conducted this summer.",
      "How depressing that it was destined to be framed as a response to one prick rather than being a showcase of an excellence it is easy to imagine the 25-year-old replicating on grander stages.",
      "Yet in retaining control over that situation and basically fool-proofing their attack for at least another season, Bournemouth have guaranteed their eventual reward for helping produce such a phenomenal talent and character. That is what they do and they are damn good at it.",
      "",
      "Newcastle without Alexander Isak\nAfter a summer spent self-injuriously and painstakingly proving they are not a particularly big club – or at least not at all well-versed in navigating the sharp end of the sport – how relieved Newcastle must have been to remind the Premier League they remain a big team.",
      "It has been a chastening transfer window but even that is starting to turn around in terms of signings and the petering out of a saga which, for better or worse, need no longer dominate the discourse and cloud the outlook. There can be few better distractions than the return of actual football.",
      "Alexander Isak not being front and centre of every discussion can only benefit Newcastle, even if his absence remained a talking point purely because of what they were missing. But that was more as a concept rather than an individual.",
      "The Magpies did almost everything right up until the final action and a competent, reliable centre-forward can solve that. The position is made for Isak if he is willing to run off all the humble pie headed his way if the deadline passes without a move.",
      "But selling him and reinvesting those funds in a natural goalscorer while improving depth and quality across the rest of an already very good squad really isn’t the worst scenario either.",
      "Newcastle were really good without Isak, can be much better with him, but could be even better than that if they sold up and got the next few recruitment calls right. Against all odds and contrary to popular opinion all summer, it is a decent position to be in.",
      "",
      "Spurs\nAnother club who will welcome the opportunity to take their collective mind off transfer nonsense by getting down to the far less important business of kicking a bag of air around. Doing so at home to a Scott Parker team was a blessing.",
      "The Super Cup performance indicated Spurs can hold their own against better sides; this showed they can sweep lesser opponents away through moments of sheer individual brilliance outside a solid structure already installed by Thomas Frank. They have already matched last season’s points haul at home to promoted teams.",
      "The luxury of having forwards signed for £60m, £55m and £47.5m rather than being made to sell them will be among the bigger differences Frank finds in his new role. It certainly helped decide his first game and settle the nerves.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nThere is a lot to be said for winning against the balance of play. Even more so away, considering the only other side to do so on the opening weekend was a Manchester City team given the slightly easier task of trekking down to Wolves.",
      "It is the sort of result Arsenal would not have been able to grind out before and that should be reflected in the analysis. The softer, more pliable Gunners of years gone by would have drawn or even lost, wilting under the pressure.",
      "The room for improvement was clear, but so too was evidence of how far they have come.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nIn their last 10 games, Palace have visited Chelsea, Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal and hosted Nottingham Forest, while visiting Wembley three times to face the two most recent Premier League champions and a Champions League quarter-finalist.",
      "They have remained unbeaten throughout, winning the first two major trophies in the club’s existence.",

      "Perhaps they should.",
      "It also feels disconcertingly premature for said manager to be discussing the need to “bounce back” while repeatedly lamenting the lack of “the basics”. The argument behind keeping Potter despite the struggles endured last campaign revolved around him needing a pre-season to properly get his ideas across, yet no team looked nearly as unready or rudimentary over the opening weekend.",
      "West Ham were in control until the precise moment they weren’t, when a team mostly unversed in the ways of the Premier League bullied and subdued them.",
      "Potter was right when he said: “If we don’t do the basics right, you can bring in player and player and player and player and it’s not going to solve the problems.” But the same can be said of the individual paid handsomely to ensure those basics are actually in place in time for the new season.",

      "There are the makings of a decent team with those composite parts Brentford have assembled in trying to remake the 2022 version of Liverpool – and Mikkel Damsgaard’s return should boost them – but Dango Ouattara will need to start the theme of any and all new signings hitting the ground running.",

      "Ruben Amorim\nIt was a vast improvement. But that Opta stat about it being the fastest a manager has reached 15 defeats in the Premier League without taking charge of a newly-promoted team in that period since Paul Hart is very funny.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nHow curious that one of only three teams who didn’t name an outfield summer signing in their starting line-up would put in arguably the most disjointed, confused performance.",
      "There is a sense that not only does Villa’s season hang in the balance of the final couple of weeks of this transfer window, but that it is more true for them than any other side.",
      "That was reinforced by Unai Emery’s impassioned thoughts on financial restrictions before the game, the vocal fan sentiment during it, and the level of frustration at stagnation after, fuelled by having three shots to 16 at home to a fellow prospective glass-ceiling shatterer who have also had a difficult summer.",
      "Even the impact of their only debutant showed the benefits of keeping the pack fresh, the options plentiful and the competition healthy. But 34-year-old Marco Bizot, purchased for a small undisclosed fee and immediately showing up Robin Olsen, cannot remain their best signing this season if they wish to maintain this upward trajectory.",
      "",
      "Chelsea\nIt will be interesting to see what comes of Enzo Maresca rocking the Chelsea boat ever so slightly instead of toeing the company line. The Italian was appointed in part because of his malleability to the club’s stated transfer policy, so going against that to request more signings was a change in tack.",
      "But it did feel like Maresca was rewarding Josh Acheampong rather than using him as a message to the board like Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte would. Jeremie Boga started the opening day of the 2017/18 season, was substituted on 18 minutes after a red card and then got loaned out to the Championship; history will not repeat itself here.",
      "A fine performance from the 19-year-old is unlikely to sate Maresca’s transfer desires. When Chelsea get up to speed after their Club World Cup excursions it seems likely Levi Colwill’s absence will only be more obvious.",

      "I think most of us think Manchester United will be better this year, as much as we might wish they wouldn’t be. They were certainly much better against a tedious, unimaginative and lucky Arsenal side.",
      "Being utterly rotten for two consecutive seasons when you’ve spent millions seems unlikely and goes against the orthodoxy that it’s not how you perform that dictates your Premier League position; it’s how much you spend on transfers and wages. And all those football brains couldn’t be wrong, could they?",
      "But if this is true, it is a time of danger to the United behemoth because there is much entertainment in watching them fail. It’s funny for the rest of us, representing – as it does – the collapse of the elites more broadly. In this world where failing upwards to positions of power and responsibility is sickeningly common, seeing expensive, over-vaunted players being useless is very satisfying and makes the world seem more sane.",
      "So in this way, radical failure is good for business. People want to watch them to see them be useless and fans want to see them to prove they’re not fickle.",
      "Fine for a season, but what happens if they’re a bit better? Say they finish ninth; that’s a disaster. Everyone has a blip, but what if it’s not a blip? Mediocrity can become endemic and there’s nothing like mediocrity to erode interest.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions on Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal: Gyokeres, Mbeumo, Martinelli, £100m Fernandes",
      "In other words, if they want to maintain their global position as one of the world’s biggest clubs, they need to get good and quickly. Winning a few, losing a few, simply won’t do. They have to aim at the top six to retain the level of interest they’re used to; being average is an interest-killer.",
      "Because this is a fanbase increasingly drawn from an encouraged tourist trade and they can’t be relied upon to keep buying all the expensive tat and snapping up over-priced tickets to watch mediocrity. TV people also want to build up their games as A Big Event and trying to do that when they keep getting turned over won’t do. They’re used to selling them with inappropriate hyperbole. But you can’t sell sh*t as sugar forever.",
      "Obviously coming back from 15th wouldn’t be easy for any side and United’s case is harder than most because of the pressure of the money that has been thrown at the problem, but that’s what Ruben Amorim must do to keep his job. No time to build, no time for bedding in; you’ve had those days. Be successful now. That’s the be all and end all.",
      "It doesn’t seem fair – in many ways he’s like the current government taking the blame for but having to deal with 14 years of the worst, most irresponsible, lunatic and hapless government. It’s not his fault, but nonetheless he’s got to do something about it. Does he look like he can?",
      "Tottenham are edging towards a deal for Eberechi Eze and Manchester United are fielding new enquiries for Rasmus Hojlund, all the while Yoane Wissa fumes…",
      "Arsenal fans are out in force to defence their club and their new ‘Viking clogger’, but there are also views on Bournemouth, Brentford, Spurs and more.",
      "Sunderland and Manchester City could not have planned better starts, while a Liverpool hero stepped up. And West Ham should “panic about its managers”.",
      "Arsenal won at Manchester United and there were ’emotional reactions’ all over the shop, not most from Declan Rice.",
      "Ruben Amorim has had his first rant of the season after a reporter suggested Tom Heaton would have been a better choice between the sticks.",
      "As bad as Viktor Gyokeres was against Manchester United on Sunday (and he was bad), he does not make the first Worst XI of the season."

      "The Turkish keeper flapped at Declan Rice’s free kick, leaving Riccardo Calafiori with an empty net to head into, and it is not the first time the 27-year-old has failed to deal with an aerial ball.",
      "In December, Son Heung-min scored directly from a corner as Tottenham beat United in the Carabao Cup but when that incident was brought up to Amorim, he angrily replied that it would have been disallowed had VAR been used.",
      "“Why? Without VAR [it was given. With VAR, it’s a foul. And then what happened in the next game? Arsenal. Who saved the penalty? Who saved the game?”",

      "And now the Egyptian is the joint-favourite for the 2025/26 award after the opening weekend of action.",
      "",
      "8=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nA goal in the Community Shield and then another in the opening Premier League game v Manchester United puts the Frenchman higher in the betting than Virgil van Dijk or Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "",
      "8=) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nA shortlisted player from the 2024/25 season, the Swede is currently in a stand-off at Newcastle as he pushes for a Liverpool transfer. He will have to either eat humble pie in the north east or hit the ground like a demon at Liverpool to win this award.",

      "8=) Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nGenuinely odd inclusion after a pretty universally rotten 24/25. But he is a former winner.",
      "",
      "7) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nIt literally took about 45 minutes against Wolves to convince everybody that the Dutchman is absolutely brilliant and could help win Manchester City another title.",
      "",
      "6) Declan Rice (Arsenal)\nIt’s interesting that Viktor Gyokeres is a rank outsider for the PFA award when his signing is likely to be the difference between being runners-up and finally winning some kind of trophy. But Rice is clearly a popular figure with his peers.",
      "",
      "1=) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nThe favourite to win the Golden Boot is a former winner and really quite likely to score the goals to win the Premier League.",
      "",

      "1=) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nThe most expensive signing of the summer has to be on this list. There can be no bedding-in period when you cost upwards of £100m. If Liverpool are to retain the title, Wirtz needs to deliver a banger."

Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",

      "Abysmal movement, poor first touch, restricted mobility, shocking passing and awareness – is this the Coventry Gyokeres and Amazon Prime mixed up the order? Perhaps this is too harsh an assessment and Gyokeres will silence his doubters with a brace at home to FC Astana in the CL and a Carabao hat trick away to Halifax Town!",
      "Not much point reiterating the question as to how a manager can spend over €1bn on a squad and make them play the sort of regressive, shambolic shite that makes you want to reach for Oxycodone 😂",
      "Antonio El Pulizon “Paella Pulis” makes you long for the OG Pulis: at least Ricardo Fuller and Arnautovic added some flair to the hoof-ball Cornerball dross! I repeat: Arteta is on £15m a year. That’s more than double Slot’s wages, more than Enrique! What for?? But hey, remember “Arsenal have more points over three years than any other side” – an Arteta quote from Friday. Literally full-on Trumpian lies Arteta is now making up in press conferences (Citeh have more points than Arsenal over three years)! I guess when you’re a perpetual fraud, the only legislation is to make shit up. Mikel should give Trump a quick call and talk tactics – another one adept at persistent ineptitude, arrogant bragging and patronising lies (without any pushback from the useless sycophantic media). Thankfully, their comfortably numb devotees will swallow every last morsel of bollocks they’re fed! 😂",
      "Arsenal are in an abysmal state and I’ll confidently predict that they will not even make the top 2 this season, and will likely accrue even less points – and more defeats – than the previous one. What do you even call a chequebook manager that never wins anything? 🤔\nStewie Griffin (Cherki just £31m, Reijnders £46m, Chelsea car boot Madueke £52m. But tell me how the “financial doping” is from Citeh!)",

      "Actually…\nArsenal played poorly but won. ManU’s expensive signings couldn’t score for toffee even though Arsenal’s new tactics left our defence wide open and invited them to.",
      "Your recent article could only pick on Arteta and Arsenal but not ManU and their manager. Only one game I know but are you going to stick with your views?",
      "Gyökeres wasn’t great but I did notice that he distracted their players and they concentrated too much on him giving Arsenal more freedom.",
      "Good game of football but at this stage means nothing. Again, Arsenal unbeaten to a ‘top six’ team in the league in football in two years;\nChris, Croydon",
      "",
      "What we learned about Man Utd\nWell, the first game done. Very decent in many ways. Only goal of the game was a GK calamity that it’s also possible to excuse as a foul since he clearly pushed the keeper. Same old same old.",
      "Of the things we learned, many were things we should already know.",
      "Casemiro simply doesn’t have the legs for the PL. Watching him “chase” Odegaard was frankly embarrassing. I love the old dog, but he really needs some sand. Ugarte may be limited but he’s a lot better suited.",
      "Dalot cannot play as an attacking RM/WB – he literally always stops and plays it back rather than take his man on. What is he still doing at the club let alone being picked as first choice? Amad is infinitely better. Mbeumo would be too.",
      "Playing without a striker in a formation built entirely around getting the ball to a striker is dumb. I know Sesko is new but that’s why you need two strikers.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are livewires with lots of threat and battle. They just need a focal point to play off. Mount is excellent and willing, with so much quality, but he’s not a false 9.",
      "Sesko looks good, although we barely saw him.",
      "Dorgu is going to be excellent. Was unlucky with his shot, but is such a willing runner and strong. (I just checked and apparently Saka played? I didn’t notice.) Yoro too is going to be a top player. De Ligt and Shaw were faultless.",
      "Then finally the contentious one. Bruno is not a CM. He loses the ball too often, he’s unaware of defending. He is willing, for sure. He can pass no doubt. But he’s not going to progress *with* the ball, or shield the back line. Mainoo is all of those things. Use him. Use Bruno further forward. Use Ugarte. Use Mbeumo or Amad out wider. Play your striker. Do that and Amorim might make it beyond Christmas.",
      "If these lessons are learned, things will be good. We opened up Arsenal more than they did to us. Lots of positives. We just really need to not concede pathetic goals from sodding corners.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "…For the first time in over a year, I watched United and actually enjoyed it.",
      "We did lose, but there’s no shame in that. One goalkeeper error cost us. We not only took the game to the second best team in the country (judging by the last few seasons) but in the second half completely pinned them back.",
      "Cunha and Mbuemo look sharp and fired up, Casemiro has clearly been told he can see long passes so go for them, the defense was strong. If Mount and Shaw can stay fit we will easily do better than last.",
      "We made subs at sensible times too. That was my biggest issue with Amorim last year, but it seems he has more confidence in the team, and they in his system.",
      "We did lack a clinical edge, but that should hopefully come as the team beds in. I did feel we lost control a bit when Ugarte came on, but I’m a lot less worried than I was before the season started.",
      "Still, only one game in. But well done Arsenal, well earned from your defensive play, and on we go to the next game!\nAndrew, MUFC",
      "",
      "…- Bruno Fernandes can’t play midfield. Even with Balebas, Hjulmands, Rodris or Makeleles. He doesn’t have the positional discipline or the physicality to do it. He is at his best when played in forward positions.",
      "– All the talk of Casemiro becoming super fit and yet he is struggling to catch Odegaard in the 36th minute shows you how well past his prime he is.",
      "– We need Emi Martinez. Not Donnarumma, we need somebody who is commanding between the sticks.",
      "– Mbeumo and Cunha played well. But we have too many players for certain positions and how Ruben is going to use them and play at their best positions will be an issue.",
      "– As a team we played well but didn’t create enough. That will improve with our 3 new signings spending more time on the pitch together. With almost only one game every week there is no need to rest our main XI so it is best Ruben strategizes Bruno’s and Amad’s respective roles with them 3 forwards.",
      "– Still 2 more weeks for the transfer market remain. UTD must dig deep to move on players who have been told that they don’t fit in months ago. No positive outgoing movement is a concern. Hopefully them moving will provide us the funds to get a GK and a robust midfielder.",
      "– All said Ruben is treading on thin ice and with the league fixture list as it is, things must improve. Not sure he will get the same backing as he did last year if results don’t go our way.\nVasanthan, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India",
      "",
      "…Was Steve Chicken watching the same game? United completely dominated an Arsenal side who are considered one of the title favourites. Alongside Cunha and Mbuemo, Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw, Dorgu, and Mount were all superb. We played some excellent stuff, were absurdly denied a stonewall penalty, and were just vastly, galactically improved from last season.",
      "Yes Bayinidir is rubbish – hopefully we get a new keeper sorted, but we look a completely different side. I know it’s easy to write low-effort snarky lines about United – and we have been shite for a while, so deserved it – but maybe some new schtick is order, because (and I realise we’ve just 0-1 to Arsenal but nonetheless) we’re f**king back. Top 5 this season for sure.\nBen, MUFC",
      "",
      "Keeping it real\nOk, so they are allowing the GK to be impeded now. Just so we know and are all on the same page to look out for consistency, which we will of course get.",

      "Shush cry babies\nLast season there were noises about players impeding keepers at corners. This weekend it’s happening again. I warn you, this sort of pathetic aversion to physical contact will kill the game, and any fan who cries about that sort of thing is going to contribute to the sort of public pressure that created the shit show that is VAR and stupid rules like ‘delaying the restart’ and whatever that rubbish was that disallowed Eze’s free kick. And if you are moaning about Saliba’s non-foul, imagine a scenario where the goal is disallowed but a penalty immediately given for the exact same offence (much worse) by Cunha on Zubimendi.

      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "These players were all uncapped at the time of their signing; whether they went on to represent England is immaterial.",
      "",
      "20) Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham to Tottenham, £25m to £30m, August 2019)\nIt is a dreadful shame that the 25-year-old Sessegnon remains uncapped. A total of 57 appearances in five seasons for Spurs leaves no mystery as to the problem for a talented player who has been derailed by injuries.",
      "The more comfortable climate of Fulham has inspired a career renaissance from a player happy to concentrate on finding his feet again at club level.",
      "MORE TRANSFER COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 The 20 biggest transfers in the world in the 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Chelsea leapfrog Liverpool on biggest transfer summer spenders of 2025 list",
      "",
      "19) James Trafford (Burnley to Manchester City, £27m to £31m, July 2025)\nBurnley were claiming this was a British record fee for a goalkeeper while Manchester City were briefing that they had only paid an initial £27m for their former keeper. Any which way, it’s a decent whack of money for an uncapped player. But that status will surely only last so long…he was in the England picture even while in the Championship.",
      "",
      "18) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland to Everton, £25m to £30m, June 2017)\n“The club’s only going forward, so it’s the best thing I can be doing,” said Pickford upon his move from Sunderland to Everton, who had just finished 7th in the Premier League and have come 8th, 8th, 12th, 10th, 16th, 17th, 15th and 13th in the subsequent eight campaigns.",
      "His first England call-up came that August before his Three Lions debut in the November. No-one has been able to out-rave him between the sticks for his country in the meantime; Pickford is two clean sheets clear of Gordon Banks and just three behind David Seaman.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (PSV to Chelsea, £30m, January 2023)\nNever has a club spent more money in a January transfer window, but even at £30m Madueke was only their fourth most expensive signing in a hectic month.",
      "It has not been entirely plain sailing since but the 23-year-old is a Premier League hat-trick scorer with three assists in six England caps.",
      "",
      "16) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester to Chelsea, £30m, June 2024)\nIt was probably not part of the grand recruitment push to offer four times as many Conference League as Premier League minutes but that was the fate which befell Dewsbury-Hall when he accompanied Enzo Maresca to Chelsea.",
      "The Leicester Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season was lost in the shuffle in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and the only likely change will be fewer consolatory European opportunities for Dewsbury-Hall now Chelsea are back in the Champions League.",
      "",
      "15) Archie Gray (Leeds to Tottenham, £30m, July 2024)\nLeeds were ‘heartbroken’ to lose the boyhood brilliance of an academy product Brentford bid £35m for and, according to some outlets, Tottenham paid up to £40m to sign.",
      "Gray perhaps didn’t realise he was signing up for a ludicrously confusing season spent playing in about five different positions for a team which finished 17th and won the Europa League, but Ange Postecoglou knew he could lean on a teenager with 32 combined caps for England U15s, U16s, U17s, U19s, U20s and U21s.",
      "",
      "14) Liam Delap (Ipswich to Chelsea, £30m, June 2025)\nIpswich knew and readily embraced their role as the stepping stone for Delap, even if they might have envisaged a fine full debut Premier League season for the striker being enough to keep them up.",
      "The odds are that Delap would have jumped ship regardless with such a tempting release clause but a dozen goals in an unsuccessful fight against relegation confirmed it.",
      "The only variable was which club would be fortunate enough to inherit the Manchester City academy product; Chelsea will do their best to ruin the slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "13) Jarell Quansah (Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m to £35m, July 2025)\nA winner of the U19 and U21 Euros, having captained England at various levels and been on Gareth Southgate’s standby list for Euro 2024, is destined to make the senior grade at some point.",
      "Quansah was even in Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad and Liverpool will be among those keen to monitor how he fares in Germany.",
      "",
      "12) Tino Livramento (Southampton to Newcastle, £32m, August 2023)\nSigned by Saints from Chelsea for just £5m in 2021, right-back Livramento earned Southampton a massive profit after just 34 appearances, his spell cruelly curtailed by injury.",
      "That likely contributed to his slow start at Newcastle, eventually turning out 35 times in his debut season and helping gradually wean Eddie Howe off his Kieran Trippier fix.",
      "",
      "11) Ollie Watkins (Brentford to Aston Villa, £28m to £33m, September 2020)\nOne season as a centre-forward was enough to tempt Aston Villa into parting with up to £33m for Watkins in September 2020. Those £5m in add-ons have surely been achieved across 87 goals, 18 England caps and Champions League qualification.",
      "",
      "10) Lewis Hall (Chelsea to Newcastle, £28m to £35m, July 2024)\nWith only 12 career appearances to his name by the time he joined Newcastle on loan, Hall was rather unsurprisingly not in the England picture.",
      "A first season with the Magpies in which he made his move permanent but still struggled for game time for the most part did little to improve those prospects.",
      "But the 20-year-old has his feet firmly under the St James’ Park table now as a fully-fledged England international.",
      "MORE TRANSFER COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Barca boost for Rashford? Arsenal could sign six players\n👉 Eze to Arsenal and Watkins to Man Utd: Best of the rest reassigned to Premier League big boys",
      "",
      "9) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "8) Omari Hutchinson (Ipswich Town to Nottingham Forest, £37.5m, August 2025)\nA year after joining Ipswich Town for a doomed year in the Premier League, the Tractor Boys almost doubled their money when Nottingham Forest came calling with a big pile of Anthony Elanga money. He has played for Jamaica but has since switched allegiances back to England, winning the Under-21 Euros in 2024.",
      "",
      "7) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "6) Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa to Newcastle United, £39m to £43m, August 2025)\nIt feels like a lot of money for a player who started just half of Aston Villa’s Premier League games the season before, but then you remember that West Ham paid £40m for…",
      "",
      "5) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "4) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "3) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "2) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’.",
      "",
      "1) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea, £48.5m to £52m, July 2025)\nIt was painfully obvious as far back as October 2024, when two Gittens goals in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid prompted this line:",
      "‘Chelsea will almost certainly not be able to help themselves when it comes to a 20-year-old English forward with experience in the Manchester City academy set-up.’",
      "And so it came to pass that the Blues added to their burgeoning attacking ranks by spending some of their Club World Cup windfall on Gittens’ capture.",
      "All it took was “a couple of text messages” from Palmer and Delap “telling me to come” and join their legion of uncapped English talents.",
      "Man City have made an offer of £250m for Chelsea superstar Cole Palmer as they look to bring him back to the Etihad Stadium, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been rejected by Real Madrid winger Rodrygo, while Arsenal have decided to ‘distance’ themselves from a deal, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak is ‘training alone’ amid uncertainty over his Newcastle, who have been dealt another huge blow as a second star ‘wants to join’ Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea have turned down a huge bid from Premier League rivals Man City as they look to re-sign Cole Palmer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will be signing one of three attacking options as their next transfer after a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is sealed, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly bracing themselves for an ‘improved offer’ from Bayern Munich for Luis Diaz with Anthony Gordon on their list of replacements."

      "Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "City have an unbelievable spine.",
      "I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.",
      "Jamie Carragher - Liverpool, ahead of Man City",
      "What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",
      "Neville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves",
      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",
      "Carragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "It's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.",
      "Neville - Adrien Truffert",
      "I was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.",
      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.",
      "Carragher - Oliver Glasner",
      "I think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.",

      "Sunday 17 August 2025 21:07, UK",
      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "Man Utd were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal in their opening Premier League game of the season; an error from Altay Bayindir led to Riccardo Calafirori's goal; Andre Onana was not in the matchday squad; Gary Neville says Man Utd need a goalkeeper, with Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma linked",
      "Monday 18 August 2025 15:56, UK",
      "The stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.",
      "The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.",
      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.",
      "\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"",
      "That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.",
      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

      "Riccardo Calafiori's header saw Arsenal edge to a 1-0 win against Manchester United in their Premier League opener, despite Ruben Amorim's side looking much-improved going forward.",
      "The Old Trafford side had splashed out on three attacking players this summer - Matheus Cuhna, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who all made their Manchester United debuts on Super Sunday.",
      "But the game was ultimately decided on a goalkeeping error. Altay Bayindir - deputising for the absent Andre Onana - failed to deal with Declan Rice's corner, allowing Calafiori to nod home inside 13 minutes.",
      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",
      "But crucially, they came away with a vital three points, showing their experience to win a game they were not at their best in. While Manchester United were beaten, there will surely be plenty of encouragement that this season will be more successful all around than the last.",
      "Man Utd: Bayindir (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Dorgu (7), Dalot (6), Casemiro (7), Mount (7), Fernandes (7), Cunha (8), Mbeumo (8).\n\n\nSubs: Amad (6), Ugarte (6), Sesko (6), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nArsenal: Raya (8), White (6), Saliba (7), Gabriel (7), Calafiori (7), Zubimendi (6), Rice (6), Odegaard (7), Saka (7), Martinelli (6), Gyokeres (6).\n\n\nSubs: Havertz (6), Madueke (6), Timber (6), Lewis-Skelly (6), Merino (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: David Raya.",

      "\"And we did it - one - because of the way we reacted to mistakes and - two - unfortunate mistakes and mistakes that are very far from the standards that we normally have, and we constantly reacted to that. And that's the reason why we had opportunity to win again.",

      "Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.",
      "New signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.",

      "When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.",
      "Cut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.",
      "Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.",
      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",

But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
